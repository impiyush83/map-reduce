thus characterized is that in which the scene of the is laid and although the plot is mainly concerned with of others than subjects of the roi chevalier we are a succession of vivid pictures of life and manners at the and in the french capital author depicts the king rather as he appeared to the world has been called the legend of the roi chevalier that is to say long prevailing idea that françois i was the most who ever sat upon a european throne had been modified by researches of those who have not feared to go behind of the old and well tutored chroniclers whose works have basis of most modern histories chroniclers who seem to have by cardinal richelieu s famous remark to an aspiring historian of certain animadversions upon the character of louis xi it is treason to discuss the actions of a king who has been dead centuries result of these researches is thus summed up by miss pardoe in preface the glorious day of marignano saw the rising and that of pavia of his fame as a soldier so true it is that the prowess of was shamed by that of the boy the early and unregretted death of his neglected queens and the heart broken endurance of contrasted with the unbounded influence of his first favorite insolent arrogance of his second will sufficiently demonstrate as a husband his open and illegal oppression of an suffering people to satisfy the cravings of an extortionate court will suffice to disclose his value as a monarch reckless indifference with which he falsified his political pledges his allies in their extremity in order to further his and sacrificed the welfare of his kingdom and the safety armies to his own puerile vanity will complete a picture by calculated to elicit one regret that his reign was not prolonged hugo dared to puncture the legend when in the play of le amuse he represented the knightly king as being enticed to a side hovel by the charms of a girl of the street but even of the citizen king louis philippe could not brook such upon the divinity that doth hedge a king and after the in 1832 the strong hand of the censorship was laid upon and fifty years elapsed before it again saw the light upon first titular favorite of king françois the comtesse whose character was in every respect to that of her successor was an object of dislike and dread de savoie the king s mother because of her unbounded françois when he returned to france after his captivity in upon his defeat at pavia his passion for madame was found to have increased rather than diminished about for some means to kill this passion and in that way end to the influence of the favorite louise de savoie was to go beyond the lovely and licentious circle of her own honor she found in anne de pisseleu mademoiselle d heilly of loveliness youth frailty and forwardness which for her purpose and so arranged her first presentation to that the desired effect was produced almost immediately it was before a suitably complaisant husband was found for the in the person of the duc d etampes and she had soon madame de châteaubriand driven her from court and a period of queenly power and magnificence which was to little change or diminution for full twenty years and until of her royal lover and slave in 1547 his excessive passion for the artful favorite blinded him to says miss pardoe already had she taught him that her love be retained only by an entire devotion and even while he to become the arbiter of his own actions she betrayed him with as bold as it was degrading nothing moreover her rapacity and while distress which amounted almost oppressed the lower classes of the citizens she greedily every opportunity of enriching herself and aggrandizing 1 following passage from the same interesting and painstaking work with the episode in ascanio of madame d etampes s colombe will serve to illustrate the extreme fidelity truth even in what may seem to be minor matters which justifies the title of historical romances as applied to many other of dumas s works we pass over for obvious reasons the minor influences each in itself but in the aggregate fearfully mischievous were exercised by the fair and frail maids of honor each each being in her turn the cynthia of the minute and one of whom owed her temporary favor to the duchesse d whose secret intrigues and undisguised ambition absorbed her time than could have been left at her disposal had she the inconstant but exacting monarch with some new object and the tact with which she selected these facile beauties one of the least of her talents never upon any occasion did the attention of the king to a woman whose intellect might after the spell of her beauty had ceased to attract him and the lovely were her victims only when their youth and were their sole attractions she was ever ready to supply lover with a new mistress but never with a friend a companion a counsellor and then as she had rightly foreseen the soon became sated by the mere prettiness of his and returned to his allegiance to herself weaned and slave than ever 2 curious parallel in this regard may be noted between the course of d etampes and the similar one pursued by madame de pompadour centuries later to maintain her power over the prematurely xv the policy of this minister in petticoats was embodied institution of the famous or infamous parc aux cerfs request of the emperor charles v to be allowed to pass on his way to chastise the rebellious people of ghent and emotions to which it gave rise at the french court much discussed by historians it seems to have been the case connétable anne de montmorency then in the prime of life and of the two dianas will remember in his old age as the loser battle of saint laurent and the favored rival of king henri ii affections of diane de poitiers was the only one of the king who opposed requiring charles to give sureties of his and to declare in writing that he traversed france only the constable s advice was adopted notwithstanding of madame d etampes who strongly urged the king to for his own imprisonment at madrid by improving the inflict the same treatment upon his life long rival and adversary incident of triboulet the jester and the tablets upon which the names of the greatest fools in the world is historical anecdote of the presentation of the diamond ring by the emperor favorite is told by miss pardoe substantially as by dumas but it by most historians of the time there is no question however the duchess was so alarmed by the condition of the king s health was prematurely impaired by his dissolute life and of her own fate when he should be succeeded by the then a willing slave to the charms of her bitter enemy diane that she exerted herself to the utmost to win the affection young duc d orléans and to procure some sort of an for him all her plans in that direction were defeated prince s death of the plague in 1545 dazzling and voluptuous diane de poitiers mistress of two kings the beautiful and accomplished but cruel and de medicis wife of one and mother of three are characters with whom dumas has dealt more fully in others works learned and accomplished author of the heptameron marguerite queen of navarre and sister of françois i of whom we obtain glimpse or two is in many respects the most of the time it is a cause for deep regret however great affection for her brother did not lead her to exert influence over him to a better end we pass from the king and his immediate circle to glance for at the other characters with whom and with certain passages lives the romance before us is mainly concerned we venture once more the same author so copiously quoted heretofore one merit must however be conceded to anne de pisseleu and her whole career we have been unable to trace any other which she possessed it cannot be passed over in silence highly for the period she loved study for its own sake protection to men of letters although it must be wherever her passions or vanity were brought into play them and their interests without hesitation or scruple it is certain that she co operated not only willingly zealously with the king in attracting to the court of france distinguished talent of europe 3 favorite s passions and vanity were brought into play in the ease cellini and she certainly abandoned him and his hesitation or scruple principal source whence our knowledge of this extraordinary man is his own autobiography which has been several times english most recently by that eminent author and critic the addington symonds following extracts from the translator s scholarly introduction a useful purpose in that they will show that the picture drawn by dumas is in no sense exaggerated and that he really extraordinary characteristics attributed to him in the and which would seem almost incredible without some a book which the great goethe thought worthy of translating into the pen of faust and wilhelm meister a book which placed upon his very limited list for the perusal of is one with which we have the right to be occupied not twice but over and over again no one was less introspective than this child of the no one was less occupied with thoughts about thinking the presentation of psychological experience vain ostentatious laudatory and self engrossed as cellini was he never stopped himself the word confessions could not have escaped a journal intime would have been incomprehensible to his fierce spirit his autobiography is the record of action and passion enjoying enduring working with restless activity hating hovering from place to place as impulse moves him the himself dramatically by his deeds and spoken words never ponderings or meditative broodings in addition to these solid merits his life as horace walpole put it more amusing than any novel we have a real man to deal with so realistically brought before us that we seem to hear him see him move a man moreover whose eminently characteristic art in a great measure still survive among us yet the adventures potent human actuality will bear comparison with those of gil bias the comte de monte cristo or quentin durward or les for their variety and pungent interest but what was the man himself it is just this question which i promised to answer implying that as a translator i have right to speak upon the subject well then i seem to know cellini first of all as a man possessed absorbing egotism violent arrogant self assertive conscious of great gifts for art physical courage address to be self reliant in all circumstances and strike if need be in support of his opinion or his right take the law into his own hands for the redress of injury this appeared to him the simple duty of an honorable man possessed the temperament of a born artist blent in almost with that of a born bravo throughout the whole of career these two strains contended in his nature for mastery the verge of fifty six when a man s blood has generally cooled that he was released from prison on bail and bound over to peace for a year with some enemy whose life was probably in danger when i come to speak about his homicides it will be obvious that killing live men quite as much as casting bronze statues he consistently poses as an injured man whom malevolent scoundrels stars conspired to persecute nor does he do this with any his belief in himself remained firm as adamant and he that he was under the special providence of a merciful god who appreciated his high and virtuous qualities in mind that all the seemingly fabulous anecdotes related or put into his own mouth by dumas are actually told in his autobiography the conclusions of mr symonds as to s veracity cannot fail to be interesting among cellini s faults i do not reckon either baseness or lying he a rogue and he meant to be veracious this contradicts and superficial view of his character so flatly that i my opinion at some length of course i shall not deny that endowed with such overweening self conceit when he comes about himself will set down much which cannot be taken trust men of his stamp are certain to exaggerate their and to pass lightly over things not favorable to the ideal but this is very different from lying and of cellini stands almost universally accused i believe that be mistaken from general considerations to particular instances of cellini falsehoods the learned translator proceeds to discuss at many of the miraculous experiences and remarkable statements which are to be found in these volumes for example of florence by an imaginary ancestor of his own named cellino a captain in the army of julius cæsar and his claim shot the constable of bourbon from the ramparts of rome in 1527 which mr symonds says bourbon had been shot dead in the assault upon that foggy morning and cellini had certainly discharged from the ramparts if it were possible to put about this event into a syllogism it would run as follows somebody shot bourbon i shot somebody being what i am i am think the somebody i shot was bourbon would be a much simpler task to make a list of the and incidents in ascanio than to enumerate those or occurrence is well authenticated colombe and her apparently creations of the novelist s brain and the same is hermann little jehan jacques aubry and his light o love of paris was jean d estouteville not robert d estourville was actually in possession of the petit nesle which was the to benvenuto by a deed which is still extant as are the naturalization bestowed upon him the trouble experienced by obtaining possession of the petit nesle is considerably overdrawn it does not appear that ascanio was ever imprisoned ascanio throughout is represented in a different light from that it appears in the autobiography although he is there said to a lad of marvellous talents and moreover so fair of person one who once set eyes on him seemed bound to love him benvenuto had much trouble with him and used continually him and he was very wroth when he found that his apprentice using the head of the mammoth statue of mars as a trysting place he was accustomed to meet a frail damsel of his acquaintance tells the story of the injury to the hand of raffaello s daughter and of his own share in her cure but the element is altogether wanting in his own narrative of the himself and that very beautiful young woman and scozzone scorzone were two women not one both ephemeral mistresses of the artist the episode of the amours and catherine is a very much softened version of an passage in the memoirs of the episode itself as told mr symonds says that it is one over which his willingly draw the veil is impossible to imagine a more natural consequence of benvenuto temperament than his absolute failure to make himself to the arrogant self seeking mistress of the king of france was oftentimes hard put to it to reconcile his admiration work of the artist with his desire to please the favorite but of one of his masterpieces the former sentiment the day notably on the occasion of the exhibition of at fontainebleau in competition with the antique from rome by primaticcio after describing the scene in substantially as it is described in the novel cellini says the king departed sooner than he would otherwise have done of the rage of the duchess calling aloud however me i have brought from italy the greatest man who endowed with all the talents passage in mr symonds s introduction to the life too long to here shows that benvenuto left france somewhat under a cloud followed by suspicions of dishonest dealing which have never satisfactorily cleared away has been said to show that in this book as always in romances dumas has substantially rewritten a chapter for the visit of benvenuto

the entrance to the church des grands augustins the precincts of the university by the receptacle for holy the door tall handsome youth olive skinned with long waving locks and eyes simply but elegantly clad his only weapon a little a hilt of marvellous workmanship was standing there and from motives of pure piety and humility had not stirred spot throughout the vespers service with head bowed in an devout contemplation he was murmuring beneath his breath i know words his prayers let us hope for he spoke so low that none and god could hear what he might say as the service drew close however he raised his voice slightly and they who him could hear these half audible words how wretchedly these french monks drone out their psalms could sing more melodiously before her whose ear should be accustomed voices ah this is well the vespers are at an end at last mon dieu grant that i be more fortunate to day than on and that she do at least raise her eyes to my face last prayer was most artful in very truth for if she to whom addressed should chance to raise her eyes to the suppliant s face would see the most adorable youthful head that she had ever seen while reading the eleven mythological tales which were at the time by virtue of the charming couplets of marot and which told of the loves of psyche and the death indeed beneath his simple sober hued costume the youth have introduced to our readers was remarkably handsome and wore of unmistakable refinement moreover his smile was infinitely attractive and his glance which dared not yet be bold was and impassioned as ever flashed from the great speaking eyes years upon hearing the movement of many chairs announcing the the service our lover for the reader will have discovered from words he has uttered that he is entitled to be so described i say drew aside a little and watched the congregation forth a congregation composed of staid church wardens matrons past their giddy days and prepossessing damsels for none of these had the youth come thither for his glance did nor did he step impulsively forward until he saw approach dressed in white and attended by a duenna a duenna of be it understood who seemed accustomed to the ways a duenna not unyouthful nor unattractive and by no in appearance when the two ladies approached the basin of our youth took some of the liquid and gallantly offered it duenna bestowed the most gracious of smiles and most grateful upon him and even touched his fingers as she took the cup to his great chagrin she herself handed to her companion latter notwithstanding the fervent prayer whereof she had been a few moments before kept her eyes constantly upon a sure proof that she knew the comely youth was there so comely youth when she had passed stamped upon the flags alas again she did not see me an equally sure proof comely youth was as we have said no more than eighteen years old after the first burst of vexation our unknown hastened down of the church and seeing that the absent minded beauty her veil and taken her attendant s arm had turned to the right to take the same direction observing that his own home lie that way the maiden followed the quay as far as michel and crossed pont saint michel still it was our hero she next passed through rue de la barillerie and crossed pont and as she was still pursuing our hero s road our hero like her shadow pretty girl s shadow is a lover alas when she reached the grand châtelet the lovely star unknown had made himself the satellite was suddenly eclipsed of the royal prison opened the instant that the duenna knocked closed again behind them young man was taken aback for a moment but as he was a very when there was no pretty girl at hand to weaken his resolution very soon made up his mind what course to pursue sergeant pike on shoulder was walking sedately back and forth door of the châtelet our youthful unknown followed the example worthy sentinel and having walked on a short distance to but not so far as to lose sight of the door he his amorous sentry go the reader has ever done sentry duty in the course of his life have noticed that one of the surest means of making the time is to commune with one s self our hero doubtless was such duty for he had hardly begun his promenade when he following monologue to himself assuredly it cannot be that she lives in yonder prison this mass and these last two sundays when i dared not follow her my eyes dullard that i was she turned not to the right upon but to the left toward the porte de nesle and aux cleres what the devil brings her to the châtelet what can to see a prisoner perhaps her brother t is most like poor girl must suffer cruelly for doubtless she is as sweet and kind as lovely pardieu i m sorely tempted to accost her ask her it is and offer my services if it be her brother i ll tell the whole story and ask his advice when one has escaped castle of san angelo as he has one has a shrewd idea of the to get out of prison there s no more to be said i ll save after i have rendered him such a service he ll be my life and death of course he ll ask me then what he can do for i have done so much for him then i ll confess that i love he ll present me to her and then we ll see if she won t eyes launched upon such a course we need not say how a lover s on unchecked thus it was that our youth was vastly amazed to clock strike four and see the sentinel relieved new sergeant began his promenade and the young man resumed his of passing time had succeeded too well for him not to continue use of it so he resumed his discourse upon a theme no of ideas than the other how lovely she is how graceful every movement how modest her bearing classic the outline of her features there is in the whole world than leonardo da vinci or the divine raphael worthy to image of that chaste and spotless being nor would they prove the task save at the very zenith of their talent o mon dieu why i a painter rather than a sculptor worker in enamel or goldsmith of all were i a painter there d be no need that i should before my eyes to make her portrait i should never cease to see blue eyes her beautiful blonde tresses her pearly skin form were i a painter i should paint her face in as sanzio did with fornarina and andrea del sarto and what a contrast betwixt her and fornarina in sooth the one nor the other is worthy to unloose her shoe laces first place fornarina youth was not at the end of his comparisons which were as will imagine uniformly to the advantage of his inamorata hour struck second sentinel was relieved six o clock t is strange how the time flies muttered the youth and if it flies thus quickly while i wait for her how should it be were by her side ah by her side i should lose count of time be in paradise if i were by her side i should but look at her so the hours and days and months would pass what a blissful would be mon dieu and the young man lost himself in an for his mistress though absent seemed to pass in his eyes the eyes of a true artist third sentinel was relieved o clock struck on all the parish churches and the shades of to fall for all authorities are in accord that the twilight july three hundred years ago was in the neighborhood of clock as now but what is perhaps more astonishing than that is perseverance of a sixteenth century lover all passions in those days and vigorous young hearts no more stopped short than in art or war the patience of the young artist for he has let us into of his profession was rewarded at last when he saw door of the châtelet open for the twentieth time but to give passage to her for whom he was waiting the same still at her side and furthermore two archers of the provost followed ten paces behind her as escort retraced the steps they had taken four hours earlier to wit au change rue de la barillerie pont saint michel and the quays they kept on by the grands augustins and some three hundred paused before a huge door in a recess in the wall beside another smaller door for the servants use the duenna knocked great door which was opened by the porter the two archers their charge with the utmost respect returned to and our artist found himself standing for the second a closed door would probably have remained there until morning for he was on the fourth series of his dreams but chance willed that by who had imbibed something too freely collided violently hola there friend said the new arrival by your leave are you or a post if so be you re a post you re within your rights and you but if you be a man stand back and let me pass pray pardon me rejoined the distraught youth but i am a stranger good city of paris and oh that s another matter the frenchman is always hospitable and your pardon you re a stranger good as you have told me who it s only fair that i should tell you who i am i am a student name is excuse me interposed the young artist but before i know who i would be very glad to know where i am porte de nesle my dear friend this is the hôtel de nesle said with a glance at the great door from which the stranger had removed his eyes very good and to reach rue saint martin where i live which i take said our lovelorn youth for the sake of saying something hoping thus to be rid of his companion rue saint martin do you say come with me i m going that way and saint michel i ll show you how you must go as i was saying i am i am returning from the pré aux clercs and my name is do you know to whom the hôtel de nesle belongs asked the marry i rather think i know my university the hôtel de nesle belongs to our lord the king and is at this moment in the robert d estourville provost of paris how say you that the provost of paris lives there by no means did i tell you that the provost of paris lives there the provost of paris lives at the grand châtelet ah yes at the grand châtelet then that s the explanation but it that the provost lives at the grand châtelet and yet leaves the hôtel de nesle in his possession t is thus the king you see had given the hôtel de nesle to a most venerable man who stood guard over the privileges of and tried all suits against it in most paternal fashion functions his unhappily our excellent bailli was so just to us that his office was abolished two years since upon that he used to sleep when hearing causes as if bailli derived from bâiller to yawn his office being thus suppressed duty of protecting the interests of the university was intrusted provost of paris a fine protector on my word as if we could as well protect ourselves how our said provost dost thou my child our said provost who is most rapacious opined that he succeeded to the bailli s office he ought at the same time his possessions and so he quietly laid hold of the grand nesle thanks to the patronage of madame d etampes and yet you say he does not occupy it not he the villain i think however that the old cassandre lodges there or niece a lovely child called colombe or colombine such name and keeps her under lock and key in a corner of nesle ah is it so exclaimed the artist hardly able to breathe for it first time that he had heard his mistress s name this to me a shocking abuse what this vast hotel to shelter one with her duenna whence comest thou o stranger not to know that nothing comes to naturally than this abuse that we poor clerks should live in a wretched garret while a great nobleman casts this with its gardens lawns and tennis court to the dogs ah there is a tennis court magnificent my son magnificent but this hôtel de nesle you say is actually the property of i to be sure but what would you have king françois i do with of his why give it to others as the provost doesn t occupy it very good then go and ask it of him for yourself why not tell me does the game of tennis please your fancy i fairly dote on it in that case i invite you to a game with me next sunday where pray at the hôtel de nesle gramercy my lord grand master of the royal châteaux t is meet should know my name at least as the young stranger knew all that he cared to know and as probably interested him but little he heard not a word of his s story as he proceeded to tell him in detail that his name aubry that he was a scrivener at the university and was from the pré aux clercs where he had had an assignation tailor s wife that she detained no doubt by her wrathful spouse not appear that he had consoled himself for simonne s absence good suresne and lastly that he proposed to withdraw from the discourteous master snip who compelled him to out with waiting and to get tipsy which was altogether all his habits the two young men reached rue de la harpe jacques aubry to our unknown the road he was to follow which he knew even his informant they then made an appointment for the at noon at the porte de nesle and parted one singing the who dreamed had abundant food for dreaming for he had learned that one evening than in the three weeks preceding had learned that the maiden to whom he had given his heart lived petit nesle that she was the daughter of messire estourville provost of paris and that her name was colombe as seen he had not wasted his day dreaming he turned into rue saint martin and stopped before house over the door of which were carved the arms of of ferrara he knocked three times who s there demanded a fresh resonant young voice from within interval of a few seconds i dame catherine replied the unknown who are you ascanio ah at last door opened and ascanio entered charming girl of some eighteen to twenty years rather dark very quick of movement and admirably well shaped withal him with transports of joy here s the deserter here he is she cried and ran or rather before to announce him extinguishing the lamp she carried open the street door which ascanio less giddy pated than she careful to secure young man although dame catherine s precipitation left him walked with assured step across a courtyard of in which every tile was surrounded by a border of rank weeds dominated by a sombre mass of tall buildings of somewhat it was the frowning and humid dwelling place of a cardinal its master had not for a long time dwelt therein sprang lightly up a flight of moss grown steps and entered hall the only room in the house that was lighted a sort refectory ordinarily dark and gloomy and untenanted for two months past had been filled with light and life and music two months past in truth this cold colossal cell had been bustling laughing good humored life for two months past benches two anvils and an improvised forge had seemed to size of the vast room sketches models benches laden with pincers and files sheaves of swords with chased hilts of and carved open work blades helmets cuirasses gold embossed whereon the loves of the gods and portrayed in relief as if to turn the mind away from the which they were destined to be used had covered the grayish walls sun had freely found its way in through the wide open windows air had been filled with the songs of joyous active workers cardinal s refectory had become a goldsmith s workshop during this evening of july 10 1540 the sanctity of had temporarily restored to the newly enlivened apartment in which it had lain dormant for a century but a table which the remains of an excellent supper lay about in confusion by a lamp which one would take to have been stolen from of pompeii of so chaste and delicate a form was it proved that the temporary occupants of the cardinal s mansion did sometimes they were in no wise addicted to fasting ascanio entered there were four persons in the workshop four persons were an old maid servant who was removing the the table catherine who was relighting the lamp a young in a corner and waiting for the lamp which catherine from before him in order to continue his work and the master with folded arms and leaning against the forge last would inevitably have been the first to be observed by any the workshop there was an indescribable impression of life and power from this remarkable personage and attracted the of those who would have chosen to withhold it he was a tall powerful man of some forty years but it would have needed of michel angelo or the pencil of ribeira to trace the outline clear cut profile to reproduce that sparkling olive complexion that bold almost kingly expression his lofty forehead eyebrows quick to frown his straight forward piercing at times with a light that was almost sublime his frank humored smile albeit somewhat satirical fascinated and awed the same time he was accustomed to stroke his black beard with his hand which was not precisely small but nervous with long fingers and great strength but withal slender lastly in his way of looking at you speaking head in all his quick expressive but not intemperate gestures in the careless attitude in which he was standing when his strength made itself felt the lion in repose was none the lion and the apprentice working in the corner formed a contrast to each other the latter a sombre taciturn fellow a narrow forehead already furrowed with wrinkles half shut eyes compressed lips she as blithe as a bird and blooming as a flower the most mischievous of eyes always to be seen beneath her and the whitest of teeth within her mouth constantly with a smile the apprentice buried in his corner was slow in his movements as if economizing his strength catherine and there going and coming never remaining one second in so did her youthful active organization overflow with life and feel the need of constant movement in default she was the fairy of the household a very skylark by virtue vivacity and her clear piercing note beginning life with such disregard of every thing beyond the moment as to fully surname of scozzone which the master had given her an which signified then and still signifies something very casse cou break neck and yet with all her childish ways so instinct with witchery and charm that she was the life and the household when she sang all the others were silent when they laughed with her when she ordered they obeyed without albeit she was not ordinarily exacting in her caprice and was so frankly and innocently happy that she diffused an good humor wherever she went and it made others glad to see story was an old old story to which we may perhaps recur born of the people she was abandoned in her infancy but her destined to afford pleasure to everybody she met a whom she afforded pure happiness introduced these new characters we now resume the thread of where we let it drop aha whence comest thou gadabout said the master to ascanio whence do i come i come from gadding about for you master since morning since morning say rather that thou hast been in quest of adventure what manner of adventure should i have been in quest of master ascanio how can i know pray well well and if it were so where s the harm interposed scozzone indeed he s a pretty boy enough to have adventures run after him he run not after adventures scozzone said the master with a frown come come don t you be jealous of him too poor dear boy and ascanio s chin with her hand ah well it only needed that jesu how pale you are does it happen that you haven t supped vagabond faith no cried ascanio i forgot it oho in that case i take sides with the master he forgot that he supped so he must be in love ruperta ruperta bring supper ascanio at once servant produced several dishes of appetizing relics of the which our hero pounced upon with an appetite by no means his prolonged exercise in the open air and the master watched him smiling the while one affection the other with a father s love the young man in the corner had raised his head when ascanio entered but as scozzone replaced in front of him the lamp she had taken when to open the door he bent his head over his work once more i was saying master that it was for you i have been running about resumed ascanio noticing the mischievous expression of the scozzone and desiring to lead the conversation to some than his love affairs how hast thou run about all day for me let us hear did you not say yesterday that the light was very bad here and must have another studio even so well i have found one for you dost thou hear pagolo said the master turning to the young man corner what did you say master he asked raising his head a second time come lay aside thy work a moment and listen to this he has found dost thou hear pardon master but i can hear very well from here what my may say i would like to complete this study it seems to it is well when one has piously fulfilled the duties of on the sabbath day to employ one s leisure in some to work is to pray pagolo my friend said the master shaking his head more in in anger you would do better believe me to work and heartily through the week and enjoy yourself on a good comrade than to idle as you do on ordinary days set yourself apart from the others by feigning so in your work on fete days but you are your own master act good to you and thou sayest ascanio my child he continued tone in which infinite gentleness and affection were mingled i say that i have found a magnificent workshop for you where do you know the hôtel de nesle perfectly that is by having passed before it for i have never the door but is its exterior attractive in your eyes pardieu it is indeed but but what but does no one occupy it pray marry yes monsieur the provost of paris messire estourville who has taken possession of it without right moreover satisfy your scruples on that head we might with great him the petit nesle where some one of his family now dwells and be content ourselves with the grand nesle and lawns and bowling greens and tennis court there is a tennis court finer than that of santa croce at florence per bacco and it is my favorite game thou didst know that ascanio yes and then master over and above all that a superb location and such air perfect country air and not such as we in this infernal corner where we are moulding forgotten by the pré aux clercs on one side the seine on the other and your great king only two steps away in his louvre but whose is this devil of a hotel whose say you pardieu the king s the king s say me that once more my child the hôtel de nesle king s his own now it remains to ascertain if he will give you so dwelling place who the king how do men call the king ascanio why françois i if i am not mistaken which means that the hôtel de nesle will be my property within but it may be that the provost of paris will take offence what care i for that but suppose he will not let go what he has in his hand suppose he will not what do men call me ascanio they call you benvenuto cellini master which means that if the worthy provost will not do things with why we will use force to compel him to do them and now let bed to morrow we ll speak further on the matter and then the shine and we shall see more clearly the master s suggestion all retired except pagolo who remained time at work in his corner but as soon as he believed that safely in bed the apprentice rose looked about drew near and poured for himself a large cup of wine which he swallowed draught then he too went off to bed goldsmith of the sixteenth we have drawn the portrait and mentioned the name of we crave the reader s permission that he may the approach the artistic subject of which we propose to indulge in a short digression upon this extraordinary man this time had been living in france for two months and who to become one of the principal characters of this history first of all let us say a word as to the goldsmiths of the is at florence a bridge called the ponte vecchio which is houses to this day these houses were in the old days goldsmiths the word is not to be understood as we understand it to day of our day follows a trade formerly the goldsmith was it was that there was nothing in the world so wondrously beautiful shops or rather as the articles with which they were stocked were round cups of onyx around which dragons tails were twined heads and bodies of those fabulous creatures confronted with gold bespangled sky blue wings outspread and with open like chimeras shot threatening glances from their ruby eyes were ewers of agate with a festoon of ivy clinging round and climbing up in guise of handle well above the orifice amid its emerald foliage some marvellous bird from in brilliant plumage of enamel seemingly alive and ready forth in song there were urns of lapis lazuli over the edge leaned as if to drink lizards chiselled with such art that almost see the changing reflection of their golden cuirasses have thought that they would fly at the least sound and in some crevice in the wall then there were chalices and bronze and gold and silver medallions all studded stones as if in those days rubies topazes carbuncles could be found by searching in the sand on river banks or dust of the highroad and there were nymphs naiads gods a whole resplendent olympus mingled with crucifixes and calvarys mater dolorosas venuses christs apollos launching thunderbolts and jehovahs creating the world this not only cleverly executed but poetically conceived not viewed as ornaments for a woman s boudoir but fit to immortalize the reign of a king or the genius of be sure the goldsmiths of that epoch bore the names of donatello guirlandajo and benvenuto cellini benvenuto cellini has himself described in his memoirs which interesting than the most interesting novel the adventurous the artists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries when titian in coat of mail when michel angelo was sculpturing with at his side when masaccio and domenichino died of poison i secluded himself in his laboratory to discover the mode steel so that it would cut porphyry show the character of the man we will take a single episode in that which was the occasion of his coming to france was at rome whither pope clement vii had summoned him at work with characteristic ardor upon the beautiful chalice holiness had ordered but as he desired to display his talent at upon the precious work he made but slow progress how benvenuto may well be imagined had many rivals who envied him the orders he received from the pope as well as the with which he executed them the result was that one of named pompeo who had nothing to do but slander his betters advantage of the delay to do him all possible injury in the pope and kept at work persistently day in and day out without relaxation sometimes in undertones sometimes aloud assuring he would never finish it and that he was so overwhelmed that he executed those of other people to the neglect of s said and did so much did good pompeo that when benvenuto him enter his workshop one day with smiling faee he divined at he was the bearer of bad news for him well my dear confrère pompeo began i have come to relieve a heavy burden his holiness realizes that your neglect his chalice is not due to lack of zeal but to lack of time therefore considers it no more than just to relieve you from some your important duties and of his own motion he dismisses you post of engraver to the mint it will be nine paltry ducats a in your pocket but an hour more each day at your disposal was conscious of an intense longing to throw the out of window but he restrained his feelings and pompeo not a muscle of his face moved thought that he had missed his aim furthermore he continued why i know not but in spite of all could say in your behalf his holiness demands his chalice at once condition it may be verily i am afraid dear benvenuto i in all friendliness that t is his purpose to have some other oh no not that cried the goldsmith starting up like one bitten serpent my chalice is my own even as the office at the mint is s his holiness hath no right to do more than bid me return hundred crowns paid to me in advance and i will dispose of my may seem good to me beware my master said pompeo imprisonment may be the sequel refusal signore pompeo you re an ass retorted benvenuto left the shop in a rage the following day two of the holy father s chamberlains called cellini the pope has sent us said one of them either to receive the your hands or to take you to prison monsignori rejoined benvenuto an artist like myself deserved than to be given in charge to functionaries like yourselves here take me to prison but i give you fair warning that all this put the pope s chalice forward one stroke of the graver went with them to the governor of the prison who received his instructions in advance invited him to dine throughout the repast the governor used every conceivable induce benvenuto to satisfy the pope by carrying the chalice to him him that if he would make that concession clement vii and obstinate as he was would forget his displeasure but replied that he had already shown the holy father his chalice since he began it and that was all that could justly of him moreover he said he knew his holiness and that he to be trusted that he might very well when he had the chalice hands take it from him altogether and give it to some idiot who would spoil it he reiterated his readiness to return hundred crowns paid in advance said so much benvenuto met all subsequent arguments of by exalting his cook to the skies and praising his wines dinner all his compatriots all his dearest friends all led by ascanio called upon him to implore him not to to destruction by resisting the commands of clement vii told them that he had long desired to establish the that a goldsmith can be more obstinate than a pope and as favorable opportunity he could ask for was now at hand would not let it pass for fear that it might not return compatriots withdrew shrugging their shoulders his friends he was mad and ascanio weeping bitterly pompeo did not forget cellini and meanwhile he was to the pope most holy father give your servant a free hand i will send word obstinate fellow that since he is so determined he may send five hundred crowns as he is a notorious spendthrift he will that sum at his disposal and will be compelled to give up to me considered this an excellent device and bade pompeo do as and so that same evening as cellini was about to be the cell assigned him a chamberlain made his appearance the goldsmith that his holiness accepted his ultimatum the delivery of the chalice or the five hundred crowns replied that they had but to take him to his workshop and give them the five hundred crowns was escorted thither by four swiss accompanied by the chamberlain entered his bedroom drew a key from his pocket opened a small built into the wall plunged his hand into a large bag took hundred crowns and having given them to the chamberlain and the four swiss the door it should be said in justice cellini that they received four crowns for their trouble justice to the swiss that they kissed his hands as they took chamberlain returned forthwith to the holy father and delivered hundred crowns whereupon his holiness in his desperation a violent rage and began to abuse pompeo go thyself to my great engraver at his workshop animal he said employ all the soothing arguments of which thy ignorant folly and say to him that if he will consent to finish my chalice give him whatever facilities he may require but your holiness said pompeo will it not be time to i fear lest it be already too late this evening imbecile and i do that benvenuto shall sleep upon his wrath therefore do on the instant and let me not fail to have a favorable morrow morning at my levée thereupon left the vatican with drooping feathers and benvenuto s workshop it was closed peered through the key hole and through the cracks in the door all the windows one after another to see if there was which showed a light but all were dark he ventured to knock time somewhat louder than at first and then a third time a window on the first floor opened and benvenuto appeared shirt arquebus in hand who s there he demanded i the messenger replied who art thou rejoined the goldsmith although he recognized his once pompeo thou liest said benvenuto i know pompeo well and he is far a coward to venture out into the streets of rome at this hour but my dear cellini i swear hold thy peace thou art a villain and hast taken the poor devil to induce me to open my door and then to rob me master benvenuto may i die say but another word cried benvenuto pointing the arquebus interlocutor and that wish of thine will be gratified fled at full speed crying murder and disappeared around of the nearest street thereupon closed his window hung his arquebus on its nail went to bed once more laughing in his beard at poor pompeo next morning as he went down to his shop which had been opened earlier by his apprentices he spied pompeo on the opposite side street where he had been doing sentry duty since daybreak see him descend soon as he saw cellini pompeo waved his hand to him in the friendly way imaginable aha said cellini is it you my dear pompeo by my faith i an ace last night of making a churl pay dearly for his assuming your name indeed said pompeo forcing himself to smile and drawing to the shop how did it happen pray thereupon described the incident to his holiness s messenger as his friend benvenuto had described him in their as a coward pompeo did not dare confess his identity with when his tale was finished cellini asked pompeo to what he was indebted for the honor of so early a visit from him thereupon acquitted himself but in somewhat different terms understood of the errand upon which clement vii had sent him to benvenuto s features expanded as he proceeded clement vii ergo the goldsmith had been more obstinate than the pope say to his holiness said benvenuto when the message was that i shall be very happy to obey him and to do my power to regain his favor which i have lost not by any fault own but through the evil machinations of envious rivals as signore pompeo as the pope does not lack retainers i in your own interest to look to it that another than you is me hereafter for your health s sake signore pompeo interfere in my affairs in pity for yourself never happen in my path the welfare of my soul pompeo pray god that i be not your cæsar waited to hear no more but returned to clement vii s reply of which however he suppressed the peroration time thereafter in order to put the seal to his benvenuto clement vii ordered his medallion struck by him struck it in bronze in silver and in gold and then to him the pope was so enraptured with it that he cried out in that so beautiful a medallion had never been produced by ah well your holiness said benvenuto had not i displayed we should have been at enmity to day for i would never you and you would have lost a devoted servant look you he continued by way of good counsel your holiness would ill to remember now and then the opinion of many discreet folk should bleed seven times before cutting once and you would do to allow yourself to be something less easily made the dupe tongues and envious detractors so much for your guidance and we will say no more about it most holy father did benvenuto pardon clement vii which he certainly would done had he loved him less but as his compatriot he was to him great therefore was his sorrow when the pope a few months subsequent to the episode we have described the iron burst into tears at the news and for a week he wept like the pontiff s demise was doubly calamitous to poor cellini very day of his burial he met pompeo whom he had not seen since when he bade him spare him the too frequent infliction of should be said that since cellini s dire threats the unhappy not dared to go out unless accompanied by a dozen men well armed he gave the same pay that the pope gave his swiss guards so walk that he took in the city cost him two or three crowns when surrounded by his twelve sbirri he trembled at the thought benvenuto cellini for he knew that if the meeting should an affray and any mishap should befall the goldsmith the pope really very fond of him would make him pompeo pay dearly for it as we have said clement vii was dead and his death restored courage to pompeo had been to st peter s to kiss the feet of the and was returning through the street dei banchi accompanied and ascanio when he found himself face to face with pompeo twelve men at the sight of his enemy pompeo became very pale he looked around and saw how amply provided he was with defenders benvenuto had only two boys with him he took heart of grace and nodded his head mockingly while he toyed with the hilt dagger with his right hand sight of this group of men by whom his master was threatened his hand to his sword while pagolo pretended to be looking direction but benvenuto did not choose to expose his to so unequal a conflict he laid his hand upon ascanio s half drawn blade back into the scabbard and walked on as if he nothing or as if he had taken no offence at what he saw hardly recognize his master in such guise but as his he withdrew with him triumphantly made a deep salutation to benvenuto and pursued still surrounded by his sbirri who imitated his bravado bit his lips till the blood came while externally wore a smile his behavior was inexplicable to any one who irascible nature of the illustrious goldsmith they had not proceeded a hundred yards when he stopped before of one of his confrères and went in alleging as a desire to see an antique vase which had recently been found in tombs of corneto he bade his pupils go on to the shop to join them there in a few moments the reader will understand this was only a pretext to get of the way for as soon as he thought that the young man and concerning whom he was less anxious because he was sure courage as he possessed would not carry him too far had turned of the street he replaced the vase upon the shelf from which it and darted out of the shop three strides benvenuto was in the street where he had met pompeo pompeo was no longer there luckily or rather unluckily this man by his twelve sbirri was a noticeable object and so inquired as to the direction he had taken the first person he applied was able to give him the information and like that has recovered a lost scent benvenuto started in pursuit had stopped at a druggist s door at the corner of the chiavica was vaunting to the worthy compounder of drugs the prowess he in his meeting with benvenuto cellini when his eye suddenly the latter turning the corner of the street with fire in his eye the perspiration streaming down his forehead shouted exultantly as he caught sight of him and short in the middle of his sentence it was evident terrible was about to happen the bravos formed a group and drew their swords was an insane performance for one man to attack thirteen was as we have said one of those leonine creatures who count their enemies against the thirteen swords which he drew a small keen edged dagger which he always wore in and rushed into the centre of the group sweeping aside two swords with one arm overturning two or three men with the other he made his way to where pompeo stood and seized him by but the group at once closed upon him naught could be seen save a confused struggling mass loud shouts and above which swords were waving for a moment mass rolled on the ground in shapeless inextricable confusion a man sprang to his feet with a shout of triumph and with a forced his way out of the group as he made his way in but triumphantly waving his blood stained dagger it cellini man remained upon the pavement writhing in the agony of death had received two blows from the dagger one below the ear the the base of the neck behind the collar bone in a few seconds his last it was pompeo other than benvenuto after such a deed would have taken at full speed but he passed his dagger to his left hand drew and resolutely awaited the sbirri the sbirri had no further business with benvenuto he who paid dead and consequently could pay them no more they ran off like of frightened rabbits leaving pompeo s body where it lay that juncture ascanio appeared and rushed into his master s arms not deceived by the ruse of the etruscan vase but although he all possible speed he arrived a few seconds too late returned to his abode with ascanio somewhat ill at ease of the three wounds he had received which were all too occasion him any anxiety but because of the possible results of six months before he had killed guasconti his brother but had come off scot free by virtue of the protection of vii moreover that act was committed by way of reprisal benvenuto s protector had gone the way of all flesh and was much more ominous be it understood did not disturb him for one moment but our readers not for that reason to form an unfavorable opinion worthy goldsmith who after killing a man after killing two indeed if we search his past very carefully after men although he had a wholesome dread of the watch did not instant fear to meet his god this man in the year of grace 1540 was an ordinary man day man as the germans say men thought so little of dying days that they naturally came to think very little of killing brave to day but the men of those days were foolhardy we are they were hot headed youths life was so abundant in those men lost it gave it sold it nay even took it with and recklessness was once an author who was calumniated and abused for many years name was made a synonym for treachery cruelty and all the mean infamy and it needed this nineteenth century the since the birth of humanity to rehabilitate that author grand patriot and noble hearted man he was and yet s only crime was that he lived at an epoch when and success were all in all when folk judged by deeds and when such men as cesar borgia the sovereign machiavelli and benvenuto cellini the artisan marched straight to without thought of methods or reasons day a body was found in the public square of cesena cut in it was the body of ramiro d orco now as ramiro d orco was personage in italy the florentine republic sought the causes of his death the eight of the signoria to machiavelli their ambassador at cesena to satisfy machiavelli made no other reply than this magnificent signoria i have naught to say anent the death of orco save this that no prince in the world is so skilful as in the art of making and unmaking men according to their deserts machiavelli was an exponent of the theory enunciated by the of the florentine republic benvenuto the genius cesar prince both considered themselves above the laws by virtue of in their eyes the distinction between what was just and what was identical with the distinction between what they could they could not do of right and duty they had not the a man stood in their path they suppressed the man to does him the honor of purchasing him in those old days the blood was boiling so abundantly in the the young nations that they shed it for their health s sake fought by instinct not for their country to any great extent women to any great extent but largely for the sake of fighting against nation man against man benvenuto made war upon françois i did upon charles v france and spain fought duel now at marignano and again at pavia all as if the most natural thing in the world without preamble without without lamentation the same way genius was exercised by those who possessed it as faculty as an absolute royal power based upon divine right the sixteenth century was looked upon as the natural birthright must not therefore wonder at these men who wondered at nothing to explain their homicides their whims and their faults which explains and justifies everything in our country in these days of ours that was the fashion therefore did simply what it was the fashion to do benvenuto cellini and benvenuto suppressed pompeo the police occasionally investigated these acts of suppression very careful not to protect a man when he was alive but in ten times they showed a feeble desire to avenge him when he experienced such a desire in the matter of pompeo and as the goldsmith having returned to his shop was papers in the fire and some money in his pocket he by the pontifical sbirri and taken to the castle of an occurrence for which he was almost consoled by that the castle of san angelo was where noblemen another thought that was no less efficacious in bringing cellini as he entered the castle was this that a man endowed inventive a mind as his need not long delay about leaving it in or another and so when he was taken before the governor who at a table covered with a green cloth and looking through pile of papers he said sir governor multiply your locks and bolts and sentinels threefold me in your highest cell or in your deepest dungeon keep upon me all day and lie awake all night and yet i warn you that all that i will escape governor looked up at the prisoner who addressed him with of assurance and recognized benvenuto cellini whom he had honor of entertaining three months before his acquaintance with the man perhaps because of it s allocution caused the worthy governor the most he was a florentine one master georgio a knight of and an excellent man but somewhat weak in the head however soon recovered from his first surprise and ordered benvenuto to to the highest cell in the castle the platform was it a sentinel was stationed on the platform and another the foot of the wall governor called the prisoner s attention to these details and thought that he had had time to digest them he said my dear benvenuto one may open locks force doors dig out from dungeon make a hole through a wall bribe sentinels and to sleep but without wings one cannot descend to earth height i will do it nevertheless said cellini governor looked him in the eye and began to think that his mad why in that case you propose to fly why not i have always believed that man can fly but i have to make the experiment here i shall have time enough and i mean to solve the problem the adventure of dædalus not fable beware the sun dear benvenuto sneeringly replied the governor beware the sun i will fly away by night said benvenuto governor was not expecting that reply so that he had no at hand and withdrew in a rage good sooth it was most important that benvenuto should make at any price at another time he would not have been at because he had killed a man and would have been quit of by following the procession of the virgin in august a doublet and cloak of blue armoisin but the new pope paul iii vindictive to the last degree and when he was still benvenuto had had a crow to pluck with him apropos of a the goldsmith refused to deliver until paid for and which sought to procure by force the result being to to the dire necessity of using his eminence s roughly moreover the holy father was jealous because i had commanded monseigneur de montluc his ambassador to see to request that benvenuto be sent to france when he of benvenuto s imprisonment monseigneur de montluc urged more strenuously than before thinking thereby to render prisoner a service but he was entirely unfamiliar with of the new pope who was even more obstinate than clement vii now paul iii had sworn that benvenuto dearly for his escapade and if he was not precisely in danger a pope would have thought twice in those days before an artist to the gallows he was in great danger of in his prison it was therefore of the utmost importance should not forget himself and that was why he was take flight without awaiting the interrogatories and judgment never have arrived for the pope angered by the intervention i refused even to hear benvenuto cellini s name mentioned prisoner knew all this from ascanio who was managing and who by dint of persistent entreaties had to visit his master their interviews of course were two iron gratings and in presence of witnesses watching to the pupil passed neither file nor rope nor knife to his master soon as the door of his cell was locked behind the governor set about inspecting his surroundings following articles were contained within the four walls of his place a bed a fireplace a table and two chairs two his installation there he obtained a supply of clay and tool the governor at first declined to allow him to means of distraction but he changed his mind upon if the artist s mind were thus employed he might perhaps idea of escape to which he clung so tenaciously the same day sketched a colossal venus this of itself was no great matter but in conjunction patience and energy it was much a certain very cold day in december when the fire was lighted on the servant changed the sheets on his bed and left the upon a chair as soon as the door was closed benvenuto made from the chair on which he was sitting to the bed took out of two enormous handfuls of the maize leaves which are used mattresses in italy stowed the sheets away in their place to his statue took up his tool and resumed his work at the servant returned for the forgotten sheets and after for them asked benvenuto if he had not seen them but carelessly as if absorbed by his work that some of his had taken them or that he carried them away himself it the servant had no suspicion of the truth so little elapsed since he left the room and benvenuto played his part and as the sheets were never found he was very careful nothing for fear of being obliged to pay for them or of losing who has never lived through some supreme crisis can form no idea possibilities of such a time in the way of terrible catastrophes anguish the most trivial accidents of life arouse in us joy as soon as the servant left the room benvenuto fell upon and thanked god for the help he had sent him his bed was never touched until the next morning after it was he quietly left the sheets in the mattress the night came he began to cut the sheets which luckily were strong in strips three or four inches wide then tied them securely as he could lastly he cut open his statue which was hollowed it out placed his treasure in the cavity then over the wound and smoothed it off with his finger and tool until the most skilful artist could not have poor venus had been made to undergo the cæsarean operation next morning the governor entered the prisoner s cell unexpectedly he was accustomed to do but found him as usual calm and hard every morning the poor man who had been specially threatened night trembled lest he should find the cell empty and it should in justice to his frankness that he did not conceal his joy when he found it occupied i confess that you make me terribly anxious benvenuto said the however i begin to think that your threats of escape amount i don t threaten you master georgio rejoined benvenuto i do you still hope to fly away luckily it isn t a mere hope but downright certainty pardieu demonio how will you do it cried the poor governor dismayed by benvenuto s real or pretended confidence in his means that s my secret master but i give you fair warning that my wings governor instinctively turned his eye upon the prisoner s shoulders t is thus continued benvenuto working away at his statue the hips in such fashion that one would have thought to rival the venus callipyge betwixt us there is a you have on your side enormous towers thick doors innumerable keepers always on the alert i have on my side and these poor hands and i warn you very frankly that you beaten but as you are a very clever man as you have taken precaution you will at least when i am gone have of knowing that it is through no fault of yours that you have no occasion to reproach yourself at all and that you neglected nothing that could help you to master georgio and now what say you to this hip for you are of art i know unblushing assurance enraged the unhappy official his prisoner his fixed idea upon which all his faculties were centred melancholy lost his appetite and started constantly like aroused from sleep one night benvenuto heard a great the platform then it was transferred to his corridor and at his door the door opened and he saw master georgio gown and nightcap attended by four jailers and eight guards governor rushed to his bedside with distorted features up in bed and laughed in his face the governor without at his hilarity breathed like a diver returning to the surface ah god be praised he cried he is still here there s much in the saying songe mensonge dream lie in god s name what s the matter demanded benvenuto and what affords me the pleasure of a visit from you at such master georgio jésus dieu it s nothing at all and i am quit of it this time for did i not dream that your accursed wings had grown huge wings you tranquilly hovered above the castle of san angelo saying adieu my dear governor adieu i did not wish to go away leave of you i go i pray that i may be so blessed as never you more what did i say that to you master georgio those were your very words ah benvenuto you are a sorry guest oh i trust that you do not deem me so ill bred as that happily it a dream for otherwise i would not forgive you happily it is not true i hold you fast my dear friend and compels me to say that your society is not of the most me i hope to hold you for a long time yet to come i do not think it retorted benvenuto with the confident smile his host to use strong language governor went out cursing benvenuto roundly and the next issued orders that his cell should be inspected every two hours and day this rigid inspection was continued for a month but end of that time as there was no apparent reason to believe was even thinking of escape the vigilance of his keepers relaxed however had employed the month in accomplishing a we have said he minutely examined his cell immediately after he consigned to it and from that moment his mind was made up as manner of his escape his window was barred and the bars were to be removed with the hand or with his modelling tool the instrument he possessed the chimney narrowed so toward the the prisoner must needs have had the fairy melusine s power herself into a serpent to pass through it door remained ah the door let us see how the door was made was a heavy oaken door two fingers thick secured by two locks bolts and sheathed on the inside with iron plates kept in place at the top and bottom it was through that door that the be effected had noticed in the corridor a few steps from the door leading to the platform at intervals of two hours he heard of the relieving sentinel going up then the steps of coming down after which he would hear nothing more for hours question for him to solve then was simply this how to reach side of that door which was secured by two locks and four bolts furthermore sheathed on the inside with iron plates kept in place at the top and bottom the solution of this problem was the which benvenuto had devoted the month in question his modelling tool which was of iron he removed one by one of all the nails save four above and four below which he the last day then in order that his work might not be detected replaced the missing heads with exactly similar ones modelled and covered with iron filings so that it was impossible for eye to distinguish the false from the true as there were and bottom together some sixty nails and as it took at least and sometimes two to decapitate each nail the magnitude of may be understood evening when everybody had retired and nothing could be the footsteps of the sentinel walking back and forth over his head built a great fire on the hearth and piled glowing embers iron plates on his door the iron became red hot and to charcoal the wood upon which it was applied but of the carbonizing process appeared on the other side of a whole month benvenuto devoted himself to this task as we but at the end of the month it was finished and he only awaited opportunity to make his escape he was compelled however a few days for the moon was near the full when the work was done was nothing more to be done to the nails so benvenuto char the door and drive the governor to desperation that very functionary entered his cell more preoccupied than ever my dear prisoner said the worthy man whose mind constantly his fixed idea do you still propose to fly away come tell more than ever my dear host replied benvenuto look you said the governor you may say what you choose but upon i believe it s impossible impossible master georgio impossible rejoined the artist why full well that word does not exist for me who have myself to do those things which are the most impossible men and that with success impossible my dear host why have sometimes amused myself by making nature jealous by fashioning and emeralds and diamonds a flower fairer far than all the the dew empearls think you that he who can make flowers can wings may god help me said the governor with your insolent ll make me lose my wits but tell me in order that these wings your weight in the air a thing which seems impossible to me what form shall you give them i have thought deeply thereupon as you may well imagine since depends entirely upon the shape of my wings with what result after examining all flying things i have concluded that if i wish by art what they have received from god i can copy the successfully but when all is said benvenuto continued the governor even if the materials with which to make a pair of wings would not fail you when the time came to use them give me what i need for their construction my dear governor and i by flying away what do you need in god s name oh mon dieu almost nothing a little forge an anvil files pincers to make the springs and twenty yards of oiled silk for good very good said master georgio that reassures me somewhat clever as you may be you never will succeed in obtaining all here t is done rejoined benvenuto governor leaped from his chair but he instantly reflected that a material impossibility and yet for all that his poor brain a moment s respite every bird that flew by his window he be benvenuto cellini so great is the influence of a master mind of moderate capacity same day master georgio sent for the most skilful machinist in and ordered him to measure him for a pair of bat s wings machinist stared at the governor in blank amazement thinking with some reason that master georgio had gone mad as master georgio insisted as master georgio was wealthy and georgio had the wherewithal to pay for insane freaks if he indulge in them the machinist set about the task and a week him a pair of magnificent wings fitted to an iron waist to upon the body and worked by means of an extremely of springs with most encouraging regularity georgio paid his man the stipulated price measured the to accommodate the apparatus went up to benvenuto s cell a word overturned everything therein looking under the bed up the chimney fumbling in the mattress and leaving not corner unvisited he went out still without speaking convinced that was a sorcerer no pair of wings similar to his own could in his cell was clear that the unhappy governor s brain was becoming more disordered descending to his own quarters master georgio found the for him he had returned to call his attention to the fact was an iron ring at the end of each wing intended to support of a man flying in a horizontal position machinist had no sooner left him than master georgio locked donned the iron waist unfolded his wings hung up his legs and flat upon his stomach made his first attempt at flying try as he would he could not succeed in rising above the floor two or three trials always with the same result he sent for once more master said he i have tried your wings but they won t work how did you try them georgio described his repeated experiments in detail listened with a sober face and said when he had concluded i am not surprised as you lay on the floor you hadn t a of air under your wings you must go to the top of the san angelo and boldly launch yourself into space and you think that in that way i can fly i am sure of it if you are so sure of it would it not be as well to make yourself the wings are proportioned to the weight of your body and not of mine the machinist wings to carry my weight would need to measure and a half more from tip to tip with that he bowed and took his leave the devil exclaimed master georgio that day master georgio indulged in various vagaries to prove that his reason like roland s was penetrating farther into imaginary realms the evening just at bedtime he summoned all the servants all all the guards if said he you learn that benvenuto cellini is intending to let him go and notify me nothing more for i shall know where to capture him even in the dark since i am myself a veritable bat he whatever he may say is only a false bat poor governor was quite mad but as they hoped that a night s have a soothing effect upon him they decided to wait before advising the pope it was an abominable night dark and rainy and no one cared out in such weather always excepting benvenuto cellini who that very night for his escape in a spirit of so as soon as he heard the clock strike ten and the that the sentinel had been relieved he fell on his knees a fervent prayer after which he set to work the first place he removed the heads of the four nails which the iron plates in place the last yielded to his efforts just heard the steps of the sentinel going up to the platform he his ear glued to the door without breathing until the came down the steps died away in the distance and once more rain fell with redoubled force and benvenuto s heart leaped for he heard it heating against the window at once tried to remove the iron plates as there was nothing to they yielded to his efforts and he placed them one by one the wall then lay flat upon the floor and attacked the bottom of the his modelling tool sharpened like a dagger and fitted to a the oak was entirely changed to carbon and gave way at touch an instant benvenuto had made an aperture at the bottom of the large to allow him to crawl through it he reopened of his statue took out the strips of linen coiled them waist like a girdle armed himself with his modelling tool of had as we have said made a dagger and fell on his knees once prayed he passed his head through the hole then his shoulders then of his body and found himself in the corridor stood erect but his legs trembled so that he was compelled to the wall for support his heart was beating as if it and his head was on fire a drop of perspiration trembled at of each hair and he clutched the handle of his dagger in his hand if some one were trying to tear it away from him as everything was quiet as nothing was stirring and not was to be heard benvenuto soon recovered himself and felt along the wall of the corridor with his hand until the wall came end then he put out his foot and felt the first step of or more properly speaking the ladder which led to mounted the rungs one by one shivering as the wood creaked feet until he felt a breath of air then the rain beat against as his head rose above the level of the platform and as he in most intense darkness for a quarter of an hour he was able at once what reason he had to fear or hope balance seemed to incline toward hope sentinel had taken refuge from the storm in his sentry box how sentinels who mounted guard upon the castle of san angelo there not to inspect the platform but to look down into and survey the surrounding country the closed side of box faced the top of the ladder by which benvenuto ascended artist crept cautiously on his hands and knees toward that part platform which was farthest removed from the sentry box there fastened one end of his improvised rope to a jutting six inches in length and then knelt for the third time o lord he muttered o lord do thou help me since i am seeking myself that prayer upon his lips he let himself down by his hands of the bruises upon his knees and his forehead which to time rubbed against the face of the wall and at last solid earth he felt the ground beneath his feet his breast swelled with of joy and pride he contemplated the immense height he had descended and could not avoid saying in an undertone free at last but his joy was short lived he turned away from the tower his knees trembled under him front of him rose a wall recently built and of which he he was lost seemed to give way within him and in his despair he fell ground but as he fell his foot struck against something hard a long beam he gave a slight exclamation of surprise and delight was saved no one knows what heart rending alternations of joy and hope minute of life can contain seized the beam as a shipwrecked sailor seizes the spar save him from drowning under ordinary circumstances two strong have found difficulty in lifting it he dragged it to the wall stood it on end against it then he climbed to the top of the wall to the beam with his hands and knees but when he arrived strength was insufficient to raise the beam and lower it on side a moment his head swam he closed his eyes and it seemed as if struggling in a lake of flames he remembered his strips of linen by means of which he from the platform slid down the beam to the ground once more and ran to the spot had left them hanging but he had fastened them so securely at end that he could not detach them in his desperation himself from the ground by hanging to them pulling with all and hoping to break them fortunately one of the knots last and benvenuto fell to the ground grasping a fragment feet long was all that he needed he rose with a bound and filled vigor climbed up to the top of the wall once more fastened to the end of the beam and slid down on the other side he reached the end of the cord he felt in vain for the ground feet and upon looking over his shoulder saw that it was six feet away he let go the cord and dropped lay still for an instant he was completely exhausted and there skin left upon his legs and hands for some moments he gazed his bleeding flesh but five o clock struck and he saw that were beginning to pale rose but as he rose a sentinel whom he had not noticed but who witnessed his performance walked toward him benvenuto he was lost and that he must either kill or be killed he drew tool from his belt and marched straight toward the guard such a determined expression that worthy doubtless he had not only a powerful man but a deathly despair to benvenuto was determined not to give ground but suddenly turned his back upon him as if he had not seen him the what that meant ran to the last rampart and found himself some twelve or above the moat such a trifle was not likely to stop a man cellini in his present predicament when he had left part cord hanging from the top of the tower and the other part the beam so that he had nothing left with which to lower himself there was no time to lose he hung by his hands from a ring in and with a mental prayer let himself drop time he fainted outright hour passed before he came to himself but the coolness which noticeable in the air as dawn approaches revived him he lay instant with his mind in confusion then passed his hand over and remembered everything felt a sharp pain in his head and saw blood upon the stones where which had trickled down from his face he put his hand to a second time not to collect his thoughts but to wounds which he found were but skin deep he smiled and tried up but fell heavily back his right leg was broken three the ankle the leg was so benumbed that at first he felt no pain at once removed his shirt and tore it into strips then put the the bone together as well as he could and applied the bandage it with all his strength and passing it under the sole of now and then in order to keep the bones in place he dragged himself on all fours toward one of the city gates within five hundred yards after half an hour of he reached the gate only to find that it was closed but a large stone under the gate which yielded to his first remove it and he passed through the hole left by it had not taken twenty steps beyond the gate when he was attacked by of famished dogs who were attracted by the odor of blood he modelling tool and despatched the largest and most savage with in the side the others immediately threw themselves upon comrade and devoured him dragged himself along to the church of la transpontina fell in with a water carrier who had just filled his jars and donkey he called him look you he said i was with my mistress circumstances although i went in at the door to come out through the window from the first floor and broke my leg carry me to the steps peter s and i will give you a golden crown water carrier without a word took the wounded man on his shoulder carried him to the designated spot having received his pay he way without so much as looking behind benvenuto still on all fours made his way to the palace de montluc the french ambassador who lived only a away de montluc exerted himself so zealously in his behalf the end of a month benvenuto was cured at the end of two months pardoned and at the end of four months he started for france and pagolo poor governor who had gone mad lived and died a madman that he was a bat and making the most violent efforts to fly benvenuto cellini arrived in france françois i was at of fontainebleau with his whole court the artist stopped town sending word of his arrival to the cardinal of ferrara who knew that the king was impatiently awaiting his coming transmitted the intelligence to his majesty benvenuto was the king the same day benvenuto he said addressing him in that mellifluous and in which the artist wrote so well for a few days while you from your fatigue and vexation repose enjoy yourself and meanwhile we will reflect and determine upon some noble you to execute he ordered apartments in the château to be made ready for and that he should want for nothing benvenuto found himself at the outset installed in the very french civilization at that time behind that of italy with which already struggling for supremacy and which it was soon to surpass he looked around he could easily believe that he had never left capital for he found himself in the midst of the arts he had known at florence primaticcio had succeeded leonardo and rosso was for benvenuto therefore to show himself not unworthy of predecessors and to carry the art of statuary as high eyes of the most gallant court of europe as those three had carried the art of painting and so benvenuto determined the king s wishes by not waiting for him to command the promised and to execute it himself of his own motion and own resources he had readily discovered the king s affection royal residence where he had met him and determined to flatter by executing a statue to be called the nymph lovely work to undertake was this statue crowned at once with oak ears and vines for fontainebleau is partly field partly forest partly vineyard the nymph of whom benvenuto dreamed must reminiscent of ceres and diana and erigone three types beauty melted into one and which while retaining characteristics should still form but a single whole should be represented upon the pedestal the attributes of goddesses and they who have seen the fascinating figures statue of perseus know the florentine master s method of marvellous details it was his misfortune that although he had in his own mind of beauty he was sadly in need of a human model for the of his work where was he to find this model in whose could be found the threefold beauty of three goddesses it is that if as in the olden days the days of apelles the beauties of the day those queens of loveliness had their own accord to pose for benvenuto he would have found what within the precincts of the court for there was a whole the flower of youth and beauty there were catherine de medicis one and twenty marguerite de valois queen of navarre who the fourth grace and the tenth muse and lastly madame d etampes whom we shall meet frequently in the course of and who was known as the loveliest of blue stockings and learned of beauties in this galaxy the artist could have than he needed but the days of apelles and phidias had long and he must look elsewhere was with great pleasure therefore that he learned that the about to set out for paris unfortunately as benvenuto the court in those days travelled like a funeral procession by twelve to fifteen thousand horse halting for the night place where there were no more than two or three houses hours every evening in pitching the tents and four hours in striking them in this way although the distance was leagues five days were spent in the journey from paris times on the way benvenuto was tempted to push forward but the cardinal of ferrara dissuaded him saying that if the compelled to pass a single day without seeing him he ask what had become of him and when he learned that he the procession would look upon his unceremonious departure as of respect toward himself so benvenuto chafed at his bit to kill time during the long halt by sketching his nymph last he arrived at paris his first visit was to primaticcio who to continue the work of leonardo da vinci and rosso primaticcio who had lived long at paris should be once to put him upon the path he was seeking and to tell him look for models word in passing as to primaticcio signor francesco primaticcio who was commonly called at this time from his birthplace had studied under jules romain for and had lived eight years in france whither françois i him upon the advice of the marquis of mantua his of artists he was as any one may see at fontainebleau a prodigious fecundity with a broad florid manner and of outline for a long time primaticcio with brain his vast store of knowledge and his which embraced all varieties of painting for a long time he was despised but in our day he has been avenged for of injustice under the inspiration of religious ardor the pictures in the chapel of beauregard in moral subjects the principal christian virtues at the hôtel montmorency the immensity of fontainebleau was filled to overflowing with at the golden gate and in the salle du bal he treated the subjects of mythology and allegory in the gallery of the chamber of saint louis he was an epic poet with homer with his brush the odyssey and a portion of the iliad passed from the age of fable to heroic times and historical his study the principal incidents in the life of alexander and the surrender of havre were reproduced in the which he decorated the grand gallery and the apartment salle du bal he turned his attention to the beauties of nature great landscapes of the cabinet of curiosities in short if we take the measurement of his eminent talent to consider the in which it found expression and to reckon up its work we that in ninety eight large pictures and a hundred and ones he has treated one after another landscapes historical allegorical and religious subjects portraits themes of epic poetry was as may be seen a man likely to appreciate benvenuto and so as benvenuto arrived at paris he ran to primaticcio with and was welcomed by him in the same temper the first serious conversation between the two friends in a foreign land benvenuto opened his portfolio imparted all to primaticcio showed him all his sketches and asked him was any one of the models he was accustomed to use who necessary conditions shook his head smiling sadly in truth they were no italy the daughter of greece and rival of her mother france was days as it is to day the land of grace and prettiness but in vain would one have sought in the domain of the imperious loveliness which inspired the genius of michel angelo of john of bologna and andrea del sarto on the banks of and the arno to be sure if the painter or sculptor had been to choose a model at will among the aristocracy he would found the types he sought but like those shades which are this side of the styx he was perforce content to see those noble forms the constant objects of his artistic aspirations into the elysian fields which he was forbidden to enter turned out as primaticcio anticipated benvenuto passed in review army of models and saw not one who seemed to combine all essential for the work of which he was dreaming he caused all the venuses at a crown the sitting whose furnished him to be summoned to the cardinal of ferrara s palace he was installed but none of them fulfilled his expectations was almost at his wit s end when one evening as he home alone along rue des petits champs after supping compatriots whom he had met at paris namely pietro strozzi of anguillara his brother in law and galeotto pico nephew famous pico della mirandole he noticed a graceful lovely in front of him benvenuto fairly leaped for joy the girl was all whom he had thus far seen by far the best qualified to to his dream he followed her therefore she walked along by of saint honoré and turned into rue du pelican there around to see if she was still followed and seeing a few steps hastily opened a door and disappeared to the same door and opened it in time to see the skirt of woman s dress disappear at a bend in the stairway which by a smoking lamp went up to the first floor a chamber door stood ajar and in he discovered the girl he had followed explaining the artistic motive of his intrusion indeed a word benvenuto desirous to ascertain whether the outlines body corresponded with those of her face walked around and poor bewildered girl as he might have done had she been a statue her arms and raising them above her head in the attitude which that his nymph of fontainebleau should assume and she gestures mechanically was little of ceres in the model now before his eyes and of diana but very much of erigone the master thereupon made mind in view of the manifest impossibility of finding the united in one person to be satisfied with the bacchante but bacchante he had certainly found all that he desired coral lips teeth like pearls graceful neck well and broad hips and in the slender wrists and ankles and nails there was a suggestion of aristocratic blood which artist s last hesitation what is your name mademoiselle benvenuto with his foreign accent last asked the poor girl whose wonder momentarily increased catherine monsieur at your service she replied very good here is a golden crown mademoiselle catherine for i have caused you come to me to morrow at the cardinal s hotel on rue saint martin and i will give you as much the same service girl hesitated an instant thinking that he was making sport of her the gold crown seemed to prove that he was speaking seriously a very brief pause she said at what time ten o clock in the morning does that suit your convenience perfectly so that i may rely upon you i will come saluted her as he would have saluted a duchess and with a glad heart he at once burned all his idealistic sketches set to work upon one based upon flesh and blood having drawing he placed a quantity of wax upon a pedestal and dexterous touch it instantly assumed the shape of the nymph of had dreamed so that when catherine appeared at the door of the next morning a part of his task was already done we have said catherine utterly failed to understand benvenuto she was vastly astonished therefore when having closed behind her he showed her the statue already begun and he had asked her to come was a light hearted joyous creature and laughed heartily mistake her bosom swelled with pride at the thought of posing as for a goddess to be presented to a king so she removed and of her own motion assumed the pose indicated by so gracefully and withal so exactly that the artist when and saw her posed so naturally and well exclaimed in delight at once set to work his was as we have said one of vigorous artistic natures in which inspiration is aroused by beneath their hands and which seem to become illumined as proceeds he had thrown aside his doublet and as he went back from the model to the copy from nature to art he seemed bare neck and arms like jupiter ready to kindle everything that into flame catherine accustomed to the commonplace or worn of the young men of the lower classes with whom she or the young noblemen whose plaything she had been gazed man with the inspired glance quickened respiration and with an unfamiliar sensation of wonder she seemed herself to the master s level her eyes shone and the artist s communicated to the model sitting lasted two hours at the end of that time benvenuto her gold crown and took leave of her as ceremoniously making an appointment for the following day at the same hour returned to her own room and did not go out during the day next morning she was at the studio ten minutes before the same scene was repeated on that day as on the day before s inspiration rose to sublime heights beneath his hand that of prometheus the clay seemed to breathe the bacchante was already modelled and seemed a living head set upon a catherine smiled upon this celestial sister fashioned in she had never been so happy and strangely enough she to explain the sentiment which caused her happiness the following day the master and the model met again at the but catherine was conscious of a sensation absent on days which caused the blood to rush to her face as soon began to disrobe the poor child was beginning to love and modesty in its train the fourth day it was still worse and benvenuto was times to remind her that he was not modelling the venus but erigone drunken with debauchery and wine moreover would be tried but a little longer two days more and s services would be no longer required the afternoon of the second day benvenuto having given the to his statue thanked catherine for her complaisance and four gold crowns but catherine let them fall to the floor the s dream was ended from that moment she must return to her and that condition had become hateful to her since the she entered the master s studio benvenuto who had no suspicion was taking place in the girl s heart picked up the four crowns them to her once more pressing her hand as he did so and her that if he ever could be of service to her she must apply to but him then he passed into the apartment where his at work seeking ascanio to whom he wished to exhibit statue kissed the tools the master had used one after another away weeping next morning catherine appeared at the studio while benvenuto and when he astonished to see her again asked her why she she knelt at his feet and asked him if he did not need a servant had an artist s heart quick to detect feeling in another what was taking place in the poor child s heart and raised the floor kissing her upon the forehead as he did so that moment catherine was a part of the studio which as we she brightened and made cheerful with her childish ways by her unceasing activity she had become almost everybody above all to benvenuto she it was who superintended everything scolding and caressing ruperta who was dismayed first appearance in the household but ended by loving her else did erigone lost nothing by this arrangement having the model always benvenuto had retouched and perfected it with greater care than ever before bestowed upon one of his statues and had then to françois i whose admiration knew no bounds and who ordered execute it in silver he subsequently conversed for a long time goldsmith asked him if he was pleased with his studio where it and whether there were beautiful things to be seen there he dismissed him he determined in his own mind to take him some morning but said nothing to him of his intention did matters stand when this history opens benvenuto working singing ascanio dreaming and pagolo praying the day following that on which ascanio returned home so late his excursion in the neighborhood of the hôtel de nesle there was knocking at the street door dame ruperta at once rose to summons but scozzone the reader will remember that this was given to catherine by benvenuto was already out of the room moment later they heard her voice half joyous half terrified o mon dieu master mon dieu it is the king the king in person to see your studio poor scozzone leaving all the doors open behind her reappeared and trembling on the threshold of the workshop where at work surrounded by his pupils and apprentices and very truth françois i was entering the courtyard with all he led by the hand the duchesse d etampes the king of with the dauphine catherine de medicis the dauphin henri ii came next with his aunt marguerite de valois of navarre almost all the nobility accompanied them went to meet them without confusion or embarrassment the king princes great lords and beautiful women as a friends and yet there were in the throng the most of france and the most resplendent beauties in the world charmed madame d etampes entranced catherine de diane de poitiers dazzled but benvenuto was familiar purest types of antiquity and of the sixteenth century in italy as the beloved pupil of michel angelo was accustomed to the kings you must needs permit us madame to admire by your side the marvels to behold said françois i to the duchesse d etampes who a smile de pisseleu duchesse d etampes who since the king s return captivity in spain had succeeded the comtesse de châteaubriand favor was at this time in all the splendor of a truly her figure was erect and graceful and she carried head with a dignity and feline grace which recalled at once and panther which she also resembled in her habit of pouncing unexpectedly and in her murderous appetites with all this courtesan was very clever at assuming an air of sincerity which would disarm the most suspicious nothing could be or more treacherous than the features of this pale lipped woman day hermione to morrow galatea with her smile sometimes cajoling terrible her glance at one moment caressing and suggestive the next flaming with wrath she had a habit of raising her slowly that one could never tell whether they would disclose or a threatening expression haughty and imperious françois i by holding his passions enthralled proud she insisted that he should call upon the comtesse to return the jewels he had given her by returning the form of bullion the lovely and melancholy countess did at against the profanation supple and deceitful she had eyes more than once when the king s capricious fancy seemed some charming young woman at court whom however abandoned very soon to return to his beautiful enchantress i was in haste to see you benvenuto for two months have now your coming to our realm and vexatious affairs of state that time forbade my turning my thoughts to things artistic it to my brother and cousin the emperor who gives me not of repose illustration 03 if it is your will sire i will write to him and pray that he you time to be a great friend to art since you have proved to this that you are a mighty captain pray do you know charles v inquired the king of navarre four years since sire i had the honor being then at rome to missal of my making to his sacred majesty and make a speech to seemed to touch him nearly what said his sacred majesty to you he said that he already knew me from having seen upon the pope s cope years before a carved stud which did me honor ah i see that you are spoiled for royal compliments said sire t is true that i have had the fortune to please many cardinals dukes princes and kings prithee show me your beautiful designs that i may see if i shall a harder judge to please than others sire i have had very little time however here are a vase and which i have commenced and which are perhaps not too unworthy majesty s attention king examined the two works of art for five minutes without a word seemed that the handiwork made him forget the workman at last ladies gathered curiously about him he spoke see mesdames he cried what marvellous workmanship observe and novel shape of this vase what ingenuity and in the bas reliefs and bosses mon dieu especially do the beauty of the lines and see how true to life and how the attitudes of the figures look at the one holding her arms head the fugitive gesture is so naturally seized that one she doesn t continue the movement in very truth i believe ancients never did anything so fine i remember the best works and those of the most eminent artists of italy but made so deep an impression upon me as this o madame de navarre you look at this pretty child lost among the flowers and little foot in the air how graceful and pretty and instinct it all is others have complimented me great king cried benvenuto but me have you aught else asked the king greedily here is a medallion representing leda and her swan made for cesarini and here a seal cut in intaglio representing and saint ambrose this is a reliquary enamelled by myself do you strike medals interposed madame d etampes as cavadone of milan did madame and you work in enamel said marguerite like amerigo of florence and you engrave seals inquired catherine like lantizco of perouse pray did you think madame that my confined to the production of tiny golden toys and great i can do a little of everything god be praised i am a engineer and i have twice prevented the capture of rome i a sonnet prettily and your majesty has but to order me to poem provided that it be in praise of yourself and i will execute it neither better nor worse than if my name were as to music which my father taught me with a stick i found an admirable one and i am so good a performer on the flute that clement vii employed me among his musicians at the age four furthermore i discovered the secret of compounding powder and i can also make beautiful carbines and if your majesty is at war and chooses to employ me at arms you will find that i am not to be despised in and that i know as well how to handle an arquebus as to culverin as a hunter i have brought down my twenty five peacocks in and as an artillerist i have freed the emperor from the prince and your majesty from the connétable de bourbon traitors to be fortunate when they encounter me of which exploit are you the prouder the young dauphin interrupted of having killed the constable or the twenty five peacocks i am proud of neither monseigneur like all other gifts address given and i simply used my address by my faith i was ignorant that you had already rendered me so great said the king a service which however my will be at great pains to pardon you was it indeed you the connétable de bourbon prithee how came it to pass mon dieu it was the simplest thing in the world the constable s arrived unexpectedly before rome and a vigorous assault upon was in progress i sallied forth with a few friends the fighting as i left my house i instinctively put my my shoulder when we reached the walls of the city i saw was nothing to be done but i said to myself it shall not that i came hither to so little purpose so i aimed my the point where i saw a numerous and compact group of soldiers singled out one who stood a head taller than his companions and a great uproar at once arose caused by the shot i had fired had in truth slain bourbon i learned afterward that it was he above his companions benvenuto was relating this incident with a most indifferent air circle of lords and ladies of which he was the centre spread and they all gazed with respect and almost with terror unconscious hero françois i alone remained at his side and so my dear fellow he said i see that you loaned me before consecrating your genius to me sire benvenuto rejoined with a smile i believe in good sooth was born to be your servitor an incident of my early youth has to me to admit of no other interpretation your crest is is it not yes with this device nutrisco et extinguo very well when i was about five years old i was sitting one day father in a small room where they had been scalding the lye a rousing fire of young oak was still burning it was very cold to glance at the fire i espied a tiny creature like a itself in the spot where the heat was most intense i out to my father and my father pray pardon me this detail of brutal custom of my country struck me a violent blow and me with great gentleness i do not strike thee because thou wrong dear child but so that thou mayst remember that the thou hast seen in the fire is a salamander no human being seen that animal save thou was not that a premonition of fate indeed i think i was predestined to do as i have done for at of twenty i was about to set out for england when the torregiano who was to take me thither told me that in his one day struck our michel angelo in the face on the occasion of quarrel ah i abandoned all thought of the journey then not prince s title would i have travelled with one who had raised his my great sculptor i remained in italy and from italy going to england i came to france france proud of your choice benvenuto will see to it that you do for your fatherland oh my fatherland is art and my prince he who commands the richest my hands have you any beautiful work now in contemplation cellini o yes sire a christ not a christ upon the cross but christ in and glory and i shall copy as closely as possible the of the guise in which he revealed himself to me what laughed marguerite the sceptic in addition to all the earth have you seen the king of heaven too yes madame replied benvenuto with childlike simplicity oh pray tell us of that said the queen of navarre willingly madame said benvenuto with a confident air which it did not occur to him that any one could doubt any part of some time before he continued i had seen satan and all his legions a necromancing friend of mine a priest evoked for me at indeed we had much ado to rid ourselves of them but souvenir of those infernal apparitions was forever banished mind when in answer to my fervent prayer the blessed saviour appeared to me in a flood of sunlight crowned with glory sweet consolation to me in the misery of my captivity and are you sure beyond a peradventure demanded the queen of navarre so sure that you have no shadow of doubt that christ really you i have no doubt of it madame in that case benvenuto go on and fashion a christ for our chapel françois i with his usual good humor sire if your majesty will so far indulge me i pray you to different and allow me to postpone the execution of why so because i promised god to undertake it for no other sovereign à la bonne heure be it so benvenuto i need twelve my table ah that is a different matter and therein sire you shall be obeyed it is my wish that they should take the form of twelve the effect will be magnificent sire they must represent six gods and six goddesses and be of my why your order is for a whole epic poem said the duchesse d etampes for a work of marvellous surprising splendor is it not i am never surprised madame i should be greatly surprised my self retorted the duchess if other sculptors than those of the olden time could a task to completion i hope nevertheless to execute it as satisfactorily as they done rejoined benvenuto coolly oho are you not inclined to boast a little monsieur benvenuto i never boast madame he made this reply with perfect calmness cellini looked at etampes and the haughty duchess lowered her eyes in spite under that firm assured glance in which there was no trace her resentment was aroused by the consciousness of to which she yielded even while resisting it and in what it consisted she had thought hitherto that beauty greatest power in the world she had forgotten genius what treasure said she with a bitter sneer would suffice such talent as yours none that i can command i faith rejoined françois i benvenuto i remember that you have as yet received but crowns will you be content with the stipend which i allowed leonardo da vinci seven hundred gold crowns yearly i will and above that for all works which you may execute for me sire your offer is worthy such a king as françois i and i say it of such an artist as cellini and yet i shall make so bold prefer a request to your majesty it is granted in advance benvenuto sire i am but ill and narrowly accommodated in this edifice one of has discovered a location much more favorably situated than the execution of such great works as my king may choose to command property in question belongs to your majesty it is the grand nesle is at the disposal of the provost of paris but he does not he occupies only the petit nesle which i will gladly leave possession so be it benvenuto said françois take up your abode at nesle and i shall have only to cross the river to talk with admire your masterpieces consider sire interposed madame d etampes that you thereby for deprive a nobleman and one devoted to my service of to his office glanced at her and for the second time anne lowered her that steady piercing gaze cellini rejoined with the good faith with which he had described the i too am of noble birth madame my family descends from a who held high rank under julius cæsar one fiorino near montefiascone and who gave his name to florence provost and his ancestors if my memory serves me have never name to anything however continued benvenuto turning and changing his expression and his tone it may be that made too hold it may be that i shall incur the hatred of influential persons who despite your majesty s protection too strong for me at last the provost of paris is said to very like an army at his orders i have been told the king interrupted that on a certain day one cellini a goldsmith retained in default of a silver vase ordered by monsieur farnese then cardinal day pope it is true sire furthermore that the cardinal s whole household stormed s studio sword in hand with the design of carrying away by force that too is true but this cellini in ambush behind the door armed with his carbine defend himself so valorously that he put monseigneur le cardinal to flight and was paid by the cardinal on the following day all that sire is strictly true very good are not you the cellini in question yes sire let your majesty but continue to bestow your favor upon nothing has any power to terrify me in that case go straight before you said the king smiling in go where you will since you are of noble blood d etampes said no more but she registered a mental vow of to cellini from that moment the hatred of an offended woman one last favor sire said cellini i cannot present all my you they are ten in number some french some german all worthy comrades but here are my two pupils whom i brought from me pagolo and ascanio come forward pagolo and raise your your eyes a little not impertinently but like an honest man no evil action to blush for this good fellow lacks inventive sire and is slightly lacking in earnestness too but he is conscientious artist who works slowly but well my ideas perfectly and executes them faithfully and ascanio my noble hearted amiable pupil and my beloved child it true that he has not the vigorous creative faculty which in a bas relief the serried ranks of two hostile in deadly encounter and tearing each other to pieces or tigers clinging with claws and teeth to the edge of a vase nor the original fancy which invents horrible chimeras and no but his soul which resembles his body has the instinct divine ideal so to speak ask him to design an angel or a group and no one can equal the exquisite poesy and grace of his work pagolo i have four arms with ascanio i have two souls and then me and i am very happy to have always by my side a pure heart like his his master was speaking ascanio stood near him modestly embarrassment in an attitude of unstudied grace and etampes could not remove her eyes from the fascinating young italian eyed and black haired who seemed a living copy of apollino if ascanio said she understands grace and beauty so well and if to come some morning to the hôtel d etampes i will furnish precious stones and gold with which he may cause some to bloom for me bowed and thanked her with a glance and i said the king grant to him as well as to pagolo a of one hundred crowns i undertake to make them earn their pension sire said benvenuto but who is the lovely child with the long eyelashes hiding yonder corner said françois spying scozzone for the first time oh pay no attention to her sire replied benvenuto with a frown she is the only one of the beautiful things in this studio whom i to have noticed aha you are jealous my benvenuto mon dieu sire i like not that any hand should be laid upon to compare small things with great it is as if some dare to think of madame d etampes you would be furious sire is my duchess duchess who was gazing at ascanio bit her lips at interruption many courtiers smiled in spite and all the ladies giggled as for the king he foi de gentilhomme your jealousy is within its right benvenuto artist and a king may well understand each other adieu my friend my statues to your attention you will commence with jupiter and when you have finished the model you will show it to me and good luck we will meet at the hôtel de nesle to bid me show you the model is a simple matter sire but how shall entrance to the louvre your name will be given at the gates with orders to introduce you presence bowed and with pagolo and ascanio escorted the king and the street at the door he knelt and kissed the king s hand sire he said with deep feeling you have heretofore saved me perhaps from death through the intervention of montluc you have overwhelmed me with wealth you have honored studio with your presence but far more than all this sire is and i know not how to thank you that it is so that you anticipate all my dreams we ordinarily work only for few scattered through the centuries but i shall have had honor of finding a living judge always present until now i have been only the workman of the future me henceforth to call myself your majesty s goldsmith my workman my goldsmith my artist and my friend benvenuto if title seems to you no more deserving of contempt than the others or rather au revoir is needless to say that all the princes and nobles followed set by the king and loaded cellini with flattery and offers all were gone and benvenuto was left alone in the courtyard pupils they thanked him ascanio effusively pagolo with like constraint nay do not thank me my children it s not worth while but look you you do in truth consider yourselves under any obligation to me since this subject of conversation was introduced to day to ask at your hands it relates to something which i have very much you heard what i said to the king apropos of catherine and said to him truly expressed the deepest feeling of my heart the necessary to my life my friends to my life as an artist because you know her services as a model are offered so freely and joyously my life as a man because i think that she loves me i pray you although she is beautiful and although you are young as is do not let your thoughts rest upon catherine there are lovely girls in the world do not tear my heart do not insult by casting bold glances upon my scozzone nay rather her in my absence and advise her as if you were her brothers you observe my wishes herein for i know myself and my this matter and i swear before god that if i should discover i would kill her and her accomplice master said ascanio i respect you as my master and i love you father have no fear blessed jesus cried pagolo clasping his hands may god preserve thinking of such an infamous action do i not know that i to you and would it not be a crime thus to abuse your in me and to repay your benefactions by such thanks my friends said benvenuto pressing their hands i faith in you and i am content now pagolo return to for i have promised the seal at which you are working to m for to morrow while ascanio and myself pay a visit to which our gracious king has bestowed upon us and of which take possession on sunday next peaceably or by force he turned to ascanio come ascanio said he let us go and see if this nesle habitation seemed to you so eligible in its external aspect has corresponding to its reputation ascanio had time to offer any observation benvenuto with glance over the studio to see if every workman was in his place a light tap upon scozzone s plump rosy cheek passed his his pupil s drew him toward the door and went out with him what use a duenna may be had taken hardly ten steps in the street when they met a man fifty years rather short of stature but with a handsome i was about to call upon you benvenuto said the new arrival saluted with respect mingled with veneration and whose cordially grasped is your business of importance my dear francesco said the goldsmith in that case i will return with you or was it for no other a friendly call in that case come with us it was to proffer you some friendly advice benvenuto i will gladly listen advice is always a good thing to receive when proffered by a friend but that which i have to give you is for no other ear than yours this youth is another myself francesco say on i would already have done so had i thought that i ought to do it benvenuto s friend pardon master said ascanio discreetly moving apart very well go alone whither i purposed going with you dear boy as you know when you have seen a thing it is as if i seen it look most carefully into every detail see if the have a good light if the courtyard will be a convenient place furnace and if it will be possible to separate our workshop from the other apprentices do not forget the tennis court that benvenuto passed his arm through the stranger s waved to ascanio and returned to the studio leaving the young in the middle of rue saint martin very truth there was in the commission intrusted to him by his than enough to embarrass ascanio his embarrassment was by no even when benvenuto proposed that they should make the visit in company judge then what it became when he found with the prospect of making it all alone he had two sundays without daring to follow her had followed her third without daring to accost her and now he was to at her home and for what purpose to examine the hôtel which benvenuto proposed by way of pastime to take s father on the following sunday willy nilly was a false position for anybody it was terrible for a lover it was a long distance from rue saint martin to the nesle had it been only a step or two ascanio would not have but it was a half league so he started so familiarizes one with danger as to be separated from it considerable time or distance to all strong minds and reflection is a powerful auxiliary ascanio belonged latter class in those days it was not fashionable to be life before one had fairly entered upon it all the impulses and ingenuously expressed joy by laughter sorrow by tears was a thing almost unknown in life as in art and a of twenty was in no wise ashamed in those days to confess that happy in all ascanio s embarrassment there was a certain amount of joy not expected to see colombe again until the following sunday and to see her that very day thus he had gained six days and six waiting are as everybody knows six centuries according to a lover so as he approached his destination the affair became more his eyes he it was to be sure who had advised benvenuto to ask for the hôtel de nesle for his studio but could colombe take of him that he had desired to be near her this installation of goldsmith in the old palace of amaury could not it was true carried out without interference with colombe s father who it as his own but would any real injury be inflicted upon d estourville when he did not occupy it moreover there were ways in which benvenuto could pay for his occupancy a for the provost a necklace for his daughter and ascanio to make the necklace might and undoubtedly would in age make the rough places smooth ascanio had seen kings and popes ready to give their coronets sceptres as the price of one of the marvellous examples of his master after all then supposing that matters should take that course robert would eventually be in master benvenuto s debt benvenuto was so generous that if messire robert showed to be courteous and compliant ascanio was certain that he benvenuto would deal right royally with him the time he reached the end of rue saint martin ascanio looked as a messenger of peace chosen by the lord to relations between two powers yet notwithstanding that conviction ascanio was not sorry are strange creatures to lengthen his journey by ten minutes instead of crossing the seine by boat he walked the whole length quays and crossed by the pont aux moulins it may be that he road because it was the same he had taken the evening before colombe his motive for making the detour he finally found himself of the hôtel de nesle in about twenty minutes when he saw the little ogive door that he must pass through when the turrets of the lovely little gothic palace boldly raising above the wall when he thought that behind those jalousies because of the heat was his beautiful colombe the house of happy dreams which he had built on the road vanished structures one sees in the clouds and which the wind overturns blow of its wing he found himself face to face with reality did not seem to him the most reassuring thing in the world after a few moments of hesitation hesitation which is to understand in that he was absolutely alone upon the quay intense heat he realized that he must make up his mind to as there was nothing for him to do but find his way into he walked to the door and raised the knocker but god only he would have let it fall had not the door chanced to open at bringing him face to face with a sort of master jacques a thirty years of age half servant half peasant it was d estourville s gardener and the gardener mutually recoiled a step what do you want said the gardener whom do you seek thus compelled to go forward with his mission summoned all and replied bravely i desire to inspect the hotel to inspect the hotel cried the gardener in amazement in in the king s name ascanio replied in the king s name cried the gardener jesus dieu does the to take it from us perhaps so but what does it mean pray understand my friend said ascanio with a self possession he mentally congratulated himself that i have no explanation you true with whom do you desire to speak is monsieur le prévôt within inquired ascanio knowing that he was not no monsieur he is at the châtelet indeed who takes his place in his absence his daughter is here mademoiselle colombe felt that he was blushing to his ears and there is dame perrine too the gardener continued does to speak with dame perrine or with mademoiselle colombe was a very simple question surely and yet it caused a in ascanio s mind he opened his mouth to say that he wished mademoiselle colombe and yet it was as if the audacious to pass his lips and he asked for dame perrine the gardener had no suspicion that his question which seemed so simple to him caused such a disturbance bowed in token of obedience and the courtyard toward the door of the petit nesle him had to cross a second courtyard pass through a second door a small flower garden ascend a flight of steps and traverse gallery at the end of the gallery the gardener opened the door dame perrine here is a young gentleman who asks to inspect the hotel the king s name that he stood aside and made room for ascanio who took his the doorway he glanced into the room a cloud passed before his eyes and against the door frame for support a very simple and unforeseen thing had happened dame perrine was with colombe he found himself in the presence of both perrine was sitting at the spinning wheel spinning colombe was at her embroidery frame they raised their heads at the and looked toward the door instantly recognized ascanio she expected him although told her that he was not likely to come as for him when he maiden s eyes raised to his face although their expression soft and sweet it seemed to him that he was dying fact is that he had anticipated a thousand difficulties of a thousand obstacles to be surmounted before he could win to his beloved those obstacles would have aroused all his strengthened his resolution and lo everything came about and simply as if god touched by the purity of his passion smiled upon it and blessed it from the first he found himself presence when he was least expecting it and of all the he had prepared the fervent eloquence of which was to amaze her he could not recall a phrase a word a syllable for her part sat motionless and dumb the two pure creatures who as if they had been already joined in wedlock felt that they belonged to one another and who when once had brought them close together would thenceforth form and hermaphrodite but one existence were terrified at meeting trembled hesitated and stood face to face unable words perrine half rising from her chair and preparing to put aside was the first to break the silence what did that blockhead raimbault say cried the worthy duenna hear colombe as colombe did not reply she continued ascanio what is your pleasure here my young master why me she suddenly exclaimed as she recognized the visitor it s the gallant youth who so politely handed me the holy water at door these last three sundays what is your pleasure my i would be glad to speak with you faltered ascanio with me alone queried dame perrine coquettishly with you alone he made this reply ascanio told himself that he was a consummate ass come this way then young man said dame perrine opening a door side of the room and signing to ascanio to follow her did as she bade him but as he left the room he cast one of those long eloquent glances wherein lovers can say and which however unintelligible they may be to are always understood at last by the person to whom they colombe undoubtedly lost no portion of its meaning for how she knew not having met the youth s she and when she felt that she was blushing she cast her upon her embroidery and began to mangle a poor inoffensive flower saw the blush and stopping abruptly stepped toward colombe at that moment dame perrine turned and called him and he to follow her had no sooner crossed the threshold of the door than colombe needle let her arms fall beside her chair threw back her head a long sigh in which were mingled by one of miracles which the heart alone can perform regret s departure and a sort of relief to feel that he was no young man was very perceptibly in a bad humor with benvenuto given him such a strange commission to fulfil with himself for to take advantage of his opportunity but most of all perrine who was cruel enough to make him leave the room just s eyes seemed to bid him remain it was that when the duenna inquired as to the purpose of his visit replied in a most deliberate manner determined to be her for his own bungling the purpose of my visit my dear madame is to beg you to show me de nesle from one end to the other show you the hôtel de nesle cried dame perrine why in heaven do you desire to see it to see if it will be convenient for us if we shall be and if it is worth while for us to leave our present quarters and live here what come and live here pray have you hired the hotel of monsieur no but his majesty gives it to us his majesty gives it to you exclaimed dame perrine more and absolutely replied ascanio to you not precisely my good woman but to my master and who is your master if i may ask young man some great no doubt better than that dame perrine a great artist come hither expressly to serve his most christian majesty aha said the good woman who did not understand very well what master make what does he make why he makes everything rings to put on maidens ewers to put upon kings tables statues to place in of the gods and in his leisure moments he besieges or as his caprice leads him to cause an emperor to tremble or a pope jésus dieu cried dame perrine what is your master s name his name is benvenuto cellini it s strange that i don t know that name muttered the duenna his profession he is a goldsmith perrine gazed wonderingly at ascanio a goldsmith she muttered a goldsmith and do you fancy le prévôt will give up his palace like this to a goldsmith if he doesn t give it up we will take it by force even so but your master will hardly dare to contend against monsieur i trust he has contended against three dukes and two popes jésus dieu two popes he s not a heretic surely he is as good a catholic as you and i dame perrine have no fear score satan is in no wise our ally but in default of the devil have the king on our side so but monsieur le prévôt has a more powerful protector than whom has he pray madame d etampes then we are on equal terms said ascanio but suppose messire d estourville refuses master benvenuto will take and suppose messire d estourville shuts himself up here as in master cellini will lay siege to it consider that the provost has twenty four sergeants at arms master benvenuto cellini has ten apprentices still we are on you see dame perrine but messire d estourville is personally a sturdy fighter at which took place at the time of the marriage of françois i was one of the challengers and all those who dared measure him were unhorsed ah well dame perrine then he is just the man for benvenuto who met his match and who like messire d estourville his adversaries but there is this difference between them afterward they who have encountered your provost are on again in good health and spirits while they who have my master with never raise their heads again and three days after are buried evil will come of this evil will come of this muttered dame perrine young man they say that fearful things are done in cities taken have no fear on that head dame perrine rejoined ascanio with you will have to do with generous conquerors what i mean my dear child said dame perrine who was not to secure a friend among the besiegers is that i fear be bloodshed for so far as your proximity to us is concerned understand that it cannot fail to be very agreeable to us is somewhat scanty in this accursed desert to which estourville has consigned his daughter and myself like two although neither she nor i have taken the vows thank god it isn for man to be alone so saith holy writ and when holy man woman is included is not that your opinion young man that goes without saying and we are entirely alone and therefore very doleful in this why do you receive no visitors here ascanio asked jésus dieu it s worse than if we were nuns as i told you nuns at least and friends who come and talk to them through they have the refectory where they can assemble and it s not very diverting i know but it s but we have only messire le prévôt who comes from time to lecture his daughter for growing too lovely i think it only crime poor child and to scold me because i don t watch enough god save the mark when she doesn t see a living the world except myself and aside from what she says to me doesn her mouth except to pray i beg you therefore young man say to any one that you have been admitted here that you the grand nesle under my guidance or that you talked with an instant at the petit nesle what cried ascanio after our visit to the grand nesle i am with you to the petit in that case i shall he realizing that his joy was carrying him too far i think it would not be courteous young man after as you did to mademoiselle colombe who is the mistress house in her father s absence and after asking to speak with i do not think it would be courteous i say to leave the nesle without taking leave of her but if you prefer not to do so are quite at liberty as you know to go into the street the grand nesle which has its own exit no no no indeed cried ascanio eagerly peste i flatter myself perrine that i have been as well brought up as anybody on earth that i know what good breeding requires in one s treatment but let us do what we have to do dame perrine without s delay for i am in very great haste now that ascanio knew that he was to return by way of nesle he was in a great hurry to be done with the grand and perrine was terribly afraid of being surprised by the provost least expected it she had no inclination to delay ascanio so down a bunch of keys from behind a door and walked on before him us in company with ascanio east a hasty glance at this hôtel where the principal scenes of our narrative will be laid hôtel or rather the séjour de nesle as it was more at that time occupied as our readers already know the site left bank of the seine on which the hôtel de nevers built to be in its turn succeeded by the mint and it was the last building in paris toward the southwest its walls nothing could be seen save the city moat and lawns of the pré aux clercs it was built by amaury lord in picardie toward the close of the eighth century philippe bought it in 1308 and made it his royal residence in 1520 the nesle of bloody and licentious memory was separated from it quay the bridge over the moat and the porte de nesle and thenceforth the grim tower stood alone upon the like a sinner doing penance the séjour de nesle luckily was so vast that the lopping off of it was not noticed it was as large as a small village a pierced by a broad ogive door and a smaller servants door it on the side of the quay on entering you found yourself in an immense courtyard surrounded by walls there was a door wall at the left and one at the back passing through the door left as ascanio did you came to a charming little building in style of the fourteenth century it was the petit nesle its own separate garden if on the other hand you passed door in the rear wall you saw at your right the grand nesle stone and flanked by two turrets with its high peaked roofs by balustrades its angular façade its high windows of many colors and its twenty weather vanes crying in the wind was room enough to provide accommodation for three bankers day you went on you lost yourself in all sorts of gardens and you them a tennis court a bowling green a foundry and an arsenal still farther on the stable yards stables cattle sheds there was accommodation for the establishments of of to day whole property it should be said was sadly neglected in very bad condition for raimbault and his two sufficed to take proper care of the garden belonging to nesle where colombe raised flowers and dame perrine vegetables the whole was of vast extent well lighted and substantially built with a slight outlay of trouble and money it could be made workshop in the world if the place had been infinitely less suitable ascanio would none the less enchanted with it as his principal desire was to near to colombe visit to the larger building was made very short in less time takes to write it the active youth saw everything that there was and formed an opinion upon everything that he saw dame perrine it impossible to keep pace with him good naturedly handed keys which he faithfully restored to her when his investigation an end now dame perrine said he i am at your service very good let us return for a moment to the petit nesle as you me that it is the proper thing to do i should say as much it would be extremely discourteous to but not a word to colombe of the object of your visit mon dieu what shall i say to her then cried ascanio you re easily embarrassed my handsome lad did you not tell me are a goldsmith indeed yes very well talk to her about jewels that is a subject that the heart of the most virtuous maiden she is or is not a of eve and if she is a true daughter of eve she loves glitters besides she has so little diversion in her solitude child that it would be a blessing to entertain her a little to the most suitable entertainment for a girl of her age would be marriage and master robert never comes hither that i do in his ear find a husband for the poor dear pray find for her stopping to consider what conjectures as to the herself and the provost might be set on foot by this her familiar manner of addressing him dame perrine led the way the petit nesle and to the room where they had left colombe was still absorbed in thought and in the same attitude in left her but no one knows how many times she had raised her head her eyes upon the door through which the comely youth had her sight any one who had observed these oft repeated have thought that she was expecting him but as she saw the upon its hinges colombe went about her work once more that neither dame perrine nor ascanio could suspect that been interrupted she had divined that the young man was following the duenna that might have been explained by magnetism if magnetism been invented i bring back with me our donor of holy water my dear colombe for is as i thought i was about to show him out by the door of nesle when he reminded me that he had not taken leave of you true enough for you didn t say one little word to each however neither of you is dumb god be praised dame perrine faltered colombe greatly embarrassed well what is it you must not blush like that monsieur ascanio is young man as you are a virtuous young woman furthermore that he is an artist in jewels precious stones and such suit the fancy of most pretty girls he will come and show them my child if you wish i need nothing murmured colombe possibly not at this moment but it is to be hoped that you will a recluse in this accursed solitude we are but sixteen years old and the day will come when we shall be a lovely fiancée all sorts of jewels will be presented and after that a great lady must have all sorts of finery when that time comes it will be to give the preference to this youth s as to those of some who surely will not be comparable to him was on the rack ascanio to whom dame perrine s forecasts future were but moderately pleasing noticed her suffering and the rescue of the poor child to whom direct conversation was times less embarrassing than this monologue by constituted interpreter oh mademoiselle said he do not deny me the great privilege some of my handiwork to you it seems to me now as if i for you and as if when making them i was thinking of you oh it i pray you for we artists in jewels sometimes mingle thoughts with the gold and silver and precious stones in with which your heads are crowned the bracelets which white arms the necklaces which rest so lovingly upon in the flowers the birds the angels the chimeras which to tremble at your ears we sometimes embody our is our duty as an historian to state that at these soft s heart dilated for ascanio mute so long was speaking and speaking as she had dreamed that he would speak for her eyes the girl could feel his burning glance fixed upon her there was nothing even to the unfamiliar tone of his voice not impart a singular charm to these words which sounded in colombe s ears and a profound and irresistible meaning flowing harmonious language of love which maidens they can speak it i know ascanio continued with his eyes still fixed upon colombe that we can add nothing to your beauty god is made none the decking out his altar but we can at least surround your with those things which are attractive and beautiful like itself when we poor humble artificers of splendor and enchantment from of our obscurity see you pass by in a blaze of glory we for being so far below you by the thought that our art to raise you to the height whereon you stand o monsieur replied colombe covered with confusion your will probably be always unfamiliar to me or at least useless in solitude and obscurity and so far is it from being the the solitude and obscurity are oppressive to me that i i love them i confess that i would like to live here always i also confess that i would like well to see your jewels not but for them not to wear them but to admire them with fear lest she had said too much and perhaps with to say even more colombe bowed and left the room so swiftly to the eyes of a man more knowing in such matters her exit worn the aspect of a flight well well exclaimed dame perrine that s not a long way like coquetry there is no doubt young man that you a book yes yes one can but believe that you italians have of fascinating people no stronger proof is needed that you have enlisted me on your side at once and pon honor myself wishing that messire le prévôt will not deal too you au revoir young man and bid your master be on his guard him that messire d estourville is as hard of heart as the devil wields great influence at court for which reason if your take my advice he will abandon all thought of living at nesle and especially of taking forcible possession of it as but we shall see you again shall we not above all do not the property of her deceased mother is sufficient to enable indulge in baubles twenty times more costly than those you offer her look you bring also some less elaborate articles it may occur to make me a little present i am not yet thank god so old that decline a little flirtation you understand do you not it necessary the better to make her meaning clear to words with a gesture she laid her hand upon the young man s arm jumped like one suddenly awakened from a sound sleep indeed to him as if it were all a dream he could not realize that under colombe s roof and he doubted whether the white melodious voice was still whispering in his ear whose had just vanished from his sight was really she for one whose eyes he would have given his life that morning with his present happiness and his future prospects dame perrine whatever she wished without even listening she asked him to do what mattered it to him was he not ready all that he possessed to see colombe once more that to prolong his visit would be unbecoming he took leave perrine promising to return the next day he left the petit nesle ascanio almost collided with two men about to enter by the way in which one of them stared at him than by his costume he felt sure that it was the provost suspicion was changed to certainty when he saw them knock at door by which he had just come out and he regretted that he sooner taken his leave for who could say that his imprudence be visited upon colombe negative the idea that his visit was of any importance assuming provost noticed it ascanio walked away without once turning to toward the only corner of the world of which he would at have cared to be king he returned to the studio he found benvenuto absorbed in thought man who stopped them in the street was primaticcio and he was way like the honorable confrère he was to inform cellini that the visit françois i paid him that morning the had succeeded in making a mortal enemy of madame la etampes lover and a of the two men who entered the hôtel de nesle as ascanio was indeed messire robert d estourville provost of paris other was we shall learn in a moment minutes after ascanio s departure while colombe was and dreaming in her bedroom whither she had fled hurriedly entered and informed the young woman that her awaiting her in the adjoining room my father cried colombe in alarm mon dieu mon dieu she added undertone can it be that he met him yes your father my dear child rejoined dame perrine replying only portion of the sentence that she heard and with him man whom i do not know another old man exclaimed colombe shuddering instinctively dame perrine what does it mean it is the first time in two years that my father has not come hither alone notwithstanding her alarm she could but obey knowing as her father s impatient disposition so she summoned all her returned to the room she had just left with a smile upon her lips this feeling of dread which she experienced for the first could not explain she loved messire d estourville as a love her father and although his demeanor toward her was expansive the days on which he visited the hôtel de nesle as red letter days among the uniformly gloomy days of her life went forward with outstretched arms and her mouth half open provost gave her no time either to embrace him or to speak he hand and led her to the stranger who was leaning against laden mantel my dear friend he said i present my daughter to you colombe this is comte d orbec the king s treasurer and your uttered a feeble exclamation which she at once stifled out for the requirements of courtesy but feeling her knees beneath her she leaned against the back of a chair for support to understand the horror of this unexpected presentation in colombe s then frame of mind it is necessary to know of man this comte d orbec was robert d estourville colombe s father was certainly far there was in his bushy eyebrows which he drew together at obstacle physical or moral that he encountered a and in his whole thickset figure something heavy which caused one to feel but slightly prepossessed in but beside comte d orbec he seemed like saint michael beside the dragon the square head and the features of the provost did at least indicate resolution of character while his small piercing gray lynx eyes but comte d orbec lean and withered with his long spider s claws his mosquito like voice and his snail was not only ugly he was absolutely hideous it was of the beast and the villain in one his head was carried side and his face wore a villanous smile and a it was that colombe at the sight of this revolting creature who to her as her future husband when her heart and her her eyes were still filled with the comely youth who had just that very room could not as we have seen wholly repress of dismay but her strength failed her and she stood and speechless gazing terror stricken into her father s face i beseech you to pardon colombe s confusion dear friend the in the first place she is a little barbarian who has away from here these two years past the air of the time being healthy as you know for attractive maids secondly i have mistake of not informing her of our plans which would have lost however since what i have determined upon needs no person before being put in execution and lastly she knows not are and that with your name your great wealth and the favor d etampes you are in a position where everything is possible upon reflection she will appreciate the honor you confer upon us to ally your ancient blood with our nobility of more she will learn that friends of forty years standing enough my dear fellow enough in god s name interposed the count come come my child he added addressing colombe with familiar assurance which formed a striking contrast to poor ascanio come compose yourself and call back to your cheeks a the lovely coloring that so becomes you mon dieu i know what girl is you know and a young woman too for that matter for already been married twice my dear good lack you must not like this i don t frighten you i hope eh added the passing his fingers through his scanty moustache your father did wrong to give me the title of husband which always agitates a youthful heart a little when it for the first time but you will come to it little one and will saying it yourself with that sweet little mouth of yours well you are growing paler and paler god forgive me i believe she he spoke d orbec put out his arms to support her but she and stepped back as if she feared his touch no less than s finding strength to utter a few words pardon monsieur pardon father she faltered forgive me it but i thought i hoped what did you think what did you hope come tell us quickly provost fixing his sharp eyes snapping angrily upon his daughter that you would allow me to stay with you always father since my poor mother s death you have no one else to love care for you and i had thought hold your peace colombe retorted the provost imperatively i am enough as yet to need a keeper and you have arrived at the to have an establishment of your own bon dieu interposed d orbec joining once more in the conversation accept me without so much ado my love with me you will be as happy can be and more than one will envy you i swear mordieu i and i propose that you shall be a credit to me you shall go and shall wear jewels that will arouse the envy i will not the queen but of madame d etampes herself know not what thoughts these last words awoke in colombe s heart color returned to her cheeks and she made hold to answer the count her father s harsh and threatening glance i will ask my father monseigneur at least to give me time to your proposal what s that cried messire d estourville violently not an hour minute you are from this moment the count s betrothed and you would be his wife this evening were it not that he to pay a visit to his estates in normandie and you know that are commands reflect indeed sarpejeu d orbec let us leave from this moment my friend she is yours and you may when you will and now let us go and inspect your future abode orbec would have been glad to tarry and add a word to what he said but the provost passed his arm through his and led grumbling he contented himself therefore with saluting his wicked smile and went out with messire robert them dame perrine entered through another door she had heard speaking in a loud voice and guessed that he was as his daughter she arrived in time to receive colombe in o mon dieu mon dieu sobbed the poor child putting her hand over as if to avoid the sight of the odious d orbec absent though o mon dieu is this to be the end o my golden dreams o my all is lost and naught remains for me but to die need not ask if this lament added to colombe s weakness and pallor dame perrine and at the same time aroused her curiosity sadly needed to relieve her overburdened heart she described worthy governess weeping the while the bitterest tears she had the interview between her father comte d orbec and herself agreed that the suitor was not young or handsome but as misfortune in her opinion that could happen to a woman was single she insisted that it was better when all was said an old and ugly but wealthy and influential husband than none but this doctrine was so offensive to colombe s heart that to her own room leaving dame perrine whose imagination active to build innumerable castles in the air in anticipation day when she should rise from the rank of mademoiselle colombe to that of comtesse d orbec s dame de compagnie the provost and the count were beginning their tour of the grand nesle as dame perrine and ascanio had done earlier results would follow if walls which are commonly supposed ears had also eyes and a tongue and could repeat to those what they have seen and heard on the part of those who have as the walls held their peace and simply looked at the provost treasurer laughing perhaps after the manner of walls it was who spoke on my word he said as they crossed the courtyard leading from to the grand nesle on my word the little one will do very well is just such a woman as i need my dear d estourville virtuous bred and ignorant when the first storm has passed over time out everything believe me i know how it is every dreams of a young handsome clever and wealthy husband mon dieu have at least half of the requisite qualities few men can say so that s a great point in my favor passing from his future the property he was to occupy and speaking with the same shrill accent of the one as of the other this old nesle is a magnificent habitation on my honor and i upon it we shall be marvellously comfortable here my wife and i my whole treasury here we will have our own apartments there my offices and over yonder the servants quarters the place as has been allowed to run to seed but with the expenditure of money which we will find a way to make his majesty pay we a good account of ourselves by the way d estourville are sure of retaining the property you should take steps your title to it so far as i now remember the king did it you after all he did not give it me true replied the provost with a laugh but me take it which is much the same thing very good but suppose that some other should play you the trick a formal request for it from him ah such a one would be very ill received i promise you when come to take possession and being sure as i am of etampes s support and yours i would make him sorely repent no no my dear fellow my mind is at ease and the nesle belongs to me as truly as my daughter colombe belongs to you therefore without fear on that score and return quickly the provost uttered these words the truth of which neither he interlocutor had any reason to doubt a third personage escorted the gardener appeared upon the threshold of the door the quadrangular courtyard into the gardens of the petit nesle the vicomte de marmagne also was a suitor for colombe s hand but by no means a favored one was a fair haired scamp with a pink face consequential insolent forever boasting of his relations with women who often as a cloak for their serious amours overflowing with pride in of secretary to the king which permitted him to approach in the same way in which his greyhounds and parrots and him the provost therefore was not deceived by his and the superficial familiarity of his relations with his majesty favor and familiarity he owed so it was said to his additions to the duties of his post furthermore the vicomte had long since devoured all his patrimony and had no than the liberality of françois how it might happen any this liberal disposition would cease so far as he was concerned messire robert d estourville was not fool enough to rely in such importance upon the caprice of a very capricious monarch therefore gently denied the suit of the vicomte de marmagne to him confidentially and under the seal of secrecy that s hand had long been promised to another thanks to communication which supplied a motive for the provost the vicomte de marmagne and messire robert d estourville to be in appearance the best friends in the world that day the viscount detested the provost and the provost of the viscount who could not succeed in concealing beneath an affable and smiling exterior from a man so messire robert to peer into the dark corners of courts and depths of men s hearts so it was that whenever the his appearance the provost expected to find in him his invariably affable and engaging demeanor a bad news which he would always impart with tears in his eyes the feigned premeditated grief which squeezes out poison upon drop by drop for comte d orbec the vicomte de marmagne had wellnigh come to rupture with him it was one of the rare instances of visible to the naked eye d orbec despised marmagne had no fortune and could make no display marmagne orbec because d orbec was old and had consequently lost the power himself agreeable to women in fine they mutually detested because whenever they met upon the same path one of them something from the other it was that when they met on this occasion the two courtiers other with that cold sardonic smile which is never seen save antechambers and which means ah if we weren t a pair how long ago one of us would have ceased to live as it is the historian s duty to set down everything bad alike it is proper to state that they confined themselves salutation and this smile and that comte d orbec escorted by and without exchanging a word with marmagne left the by the same door by which his enemy entered us hasten to add that notwithstanding the hatred which kept these two men were ready in case of need to unite destroy a third d orbec having taken his leave the provost found tête à tête with the vicomte de marmagne he walked toward him joyous countenance in striking contrast to the melancholy visage the other awaited him well my dear provost said marmagne to open the conversation in extremely good spirits while you my dear marmagne rejoined the provost seem simply because as you know my poor d estourville my friends afflict me as keenly as my own yes yes i know your heart said the provost and when i saw you in such a joyous mood with your future son in law d orbec for your daughter s betrothal to him is no longer and i congratulate you upon it my dear d estourville you know that i told you long ago that colombe s hand was promised marmagne yes but pon honor i cannot understand how you can consent to such a fascinating child oh i do not propose to part from her replied messire robert in law comte d orbec will bring his whole establishment across and will take up his abode at the grand nesle while i my unoccupied moments at the petit my poor friend exclaimed marmagne shaking his head with an air sadness and placing one hand upon the provost s arm while other he wiped away a tear which did not exist why poor friend demanded messire robert come what have you me now am i the first pray to tell you the unpleasant news what is it speak out you know my dear provost that we must take things philosophically world and there is an old proverb which we poor weak keep constantly in mind for it sums up the accumulated wisdom nations what is the proverb say what you have to say man proposes my dear friend man proposes and god disposes in god s name what have i proposed for him to dispose of say on you and let us have done with it you have intended the grand nesle for the residence of your son in law most assuredly and i trust that they will be installed there months undeceive yourself my dear provost undeceive yourself the hôtel is no longer your property at this moment pardon me you thus but i thought knowing your somewhat hasty nature it would be better for you to learn the news from the mouth of who would spare your feelings in the telling as much rather than from some malicious fellow who would take a in your misfortune and brutally east it in your faee alas no friend the grand nesle is yours no longer who has taken it from me i pray to know his majesty his majesty himself so you see that the disaster is irreparable when was it done this morning if i had not been detained by my duties at the louvre would have been sooner apprised of it you are mistaken marmagne it s some false report set afloat by and which you are in too great haste to repeat i would be glad for many reasons if it were so but unfortunately i told of it i heard it you heard it what i heard the king with his own month present the grand nesle who is this other an italian adventurer a paltry goldsmith whose name you perhaps an intriguing rascal named benvenuto cellini who came some two months since whom the king has taken upon for some unknown reason and to whom he paid a visit to his whole court at the cardinal of ferrara s hotel where artist has established his studio and you say that you were present viscount when the king grand nesle to this wretch i was replied marmagne pronouncing the words very slowly and dwelling upon them with evident relish oho said the provost very good i am ready for your adventurer come and take possession of his royal gift do you mean that you would offer resistance to be sure to an order of the king to an order of god or the devil to any order in short which to eject me from this place softly provost softly said marmagne over and above the king to which you expose yourself this benvenuto cellini is more to be feared than you think do you know who i am viscount first of all he stands very high in his majesty s good graces the moment to be sure but it is none the less true do you know that i the provost of paris represent his majesty at that i sit there beneath a canopy in a short coat and with a collar with my sword at my side a hat with waving my head and in my hand a staff covered with blue velvet secondly i will tell you that this accursed italian makes no offering combat as if he stood on equal terms with them to princes and popes do you know that i have a private seal which imparts the to those documents to which it is affixed it is said furthermore that the damned bully wounds or every one who ventures to oppose him do you not know that a bodyguard of twenty four men at arms is at night and day they say that he attacked a goldsmith against whom he had a grudge he was surrounded by a guard of sixty men you forget that the hôtel de nesle is fortified that the walls and there are machicoulis above the doors to say the city fortifications which render it impregnable on one side it is said that he is as thoroughly at home in the science of sieges or antonio de leyra as to that we shall see i am sorely afraid i will bide my time look you my dear friend will you allow me to offer you a say on so that it be brief do not try to struggle with one who is stronger than you stronger than i a paltry italian mechanic viscount you you may find reason to repent pon honor i speak whereof i know viscount you try my temper consider that the fellow has the king on his side and i have madame d etampes his majesty may take it ill of you to resist his will i have already done it monsieur and successfully yes i know in the matter of the toll at the bridge of mantes but but what one risks nothing or very little at all events in resisting a weak natured king while one risks everything in entering into a a powerful formidable opponent like benvenuto cellini by mahomet s belly viscount do you propose to drive me mad on the contrary my purpose is to make you discreet enough viscount enough ah the villain shall pay dear i swear moments that your friendship has caused me to pass god grant it provost god grant it very good very good you have nothing else to tell me no no i believe not the viscount replied as if he were trying some item of news which would make a fitting pendant to very well adieu cried the provost adieu my poor friend adieu at all events i have given you warning adieu i shall have no reason to reproach myself that consoles me adieu adieu good luck attend you but i must say that i express that wish with hope of its being gratified adieu adieu adieu adieu the vicomte de marmagne sighing as if his heart would burst grief stricken face took his departure gesticulating mournfully he had pressed the provost s hand as if he were saying farewell forever provost followed him and with his own hands secured the street him will readily be understood that this friendly conversation had d estourville s blood and stirred his bile to an extreme degree was looking around in search of some one upon whom he might vent humor when he suddenly remembered the young man whom he had from the grand nesle as he entered with comte d orbec was at hand he had not far to seek for one who could questions touching that stranger so he summoned the gardener of those imperative gestures which admit no delay and asked he knew about the young man gardener replied that the individual to whom his master referred himself in the king s name to inspect the grand nesle did not consider it his duty to take anything upon himself referred him to dame perrine who good naturedly showed the whole establishment provost thereupon rushed to the petit nesle to demand an the worthy duenna but she unfortunately had just gone out the weekly supply of provisions remained colombe but as the provost could not believe that seen the youthful stranger after the forcible and explicit terms he had forbidden dame perrine to allow good looking young men her he did not even speak to her on the subject his duties required him to return to the grand châtelet ordering raimbault on pain of instant dismissal to admit to the grand or petit nesle whoever he might be or name he might come especially the miserable adventurer been admitted previously it was that when ascanio presented himself on the following day wares in accordance with dame perrine s suggestion opened a small window and informed him through the bars that de nesle was closed to everybody particularly to him as may be imagined withdrew in despair but we hasten to he did not for a moment attribute this extraordinary reception the maiden had bestowed but one glance upon him had one sentence but that glance was so eloquent of shy affection was such a wealth of loving melody in that one sentence that seemed to ascanio since he parted from her as if an angel s singing in his heart fancied therefore and with good reason that as he had been seen provost the provost was the author of that terrible order of was the victim for attack and had no sooner returned to the studio on the previous day his report to benvenuto touching that part of his expedition to the topography of the hôtel de nesle than the goldsmith that it met his requirements in every respect hastened to of seigneur de neufville the first secretary of the king to obtain from him documentary evidence of the royal gift de neufville demanded until the following day to assure the validity of master benvenuto s claims and although the him extremely impertinent to refuse to take his word for it realized the reasonableness of the demand and assented not to allow messire de neufville a half hour s grace on day was punctual to the minute and was at once admitted to s presence which he considered a favorable augury well monseigneur he said is the italian a liar or did he tell truth the whole truth my dear friend that is very fortunate and the king has ordered me to hand you a deed of gift in proper form it will be welcome and yet continued the secretary hesitatingly well what more is there let us hear and yet if you would allow me to offer you some good advice good advice the devil that s a rare article monsieur le secrétaire on say on i should advise you to seek another location for your studio than nesle indeed retorted benvenuto dryly think you that it is not location it is indeed and truth compels me to state that you would have in finding a better very well what is the matter then that it belongs to a personage of too much importance for you to collision with him without danger i myself belong to the noble king of france rejoined cellini and never flinch so long as i act in his name very good but in our country master benvenuto every nobleman is his own house and in seeking to eject the provost from the he occupies you risk your life we must all die sooner or later was cellini s sententious reply you are determined then to kill the devil before the devil kills me trust me for that le secrétaire let the provost look well to himself as must do who assume to oppose the king s wishes especially benvenuto cellini has it in charge to carry them out messire nicolas de neufville made an end of his but alleged all sorts of formalities to be complied delivering the deed but benvenuto tranquilly seated himself that he would not stir until the document was placed in and that he was determined to stay the night there if necessary foreseen that possibility and taken the precaution to say to that he might not return note of this determination messire nicolas de neufville of consequences delivered the deed of gift to taking pains however to advise messire robert d what he had been compelled to do in part by the king s will in the goldsmith s persistence returned to his domicile without saying anything to anybody he had done locked up the deed in the drawer in which he kept stones and calmly resumed his work information transmitted to the provost by the secretary robert that benvenuto as the vicomte de marmagne had said would do persisted in his purpose to take possession of the nesle peaceably or by force the provost therefore prepared his rights sent for his twenty four sergeants at arms upon the walls and went to the châtelet only when the his office absolutely compelled him to do so passed however and cellini tranquilly occupied with the work in hand made not the least demonstration but the provost that this apparent tranquillity was only a ruse and that proposed to wait until he had grown weary of watching and then unawares and so messire robert with eyes and ears always on his mind always in a state of extreme tension and engrossed thoughts was finally reduced by this condition of affairs was neither peace nor war to a state of feverish expectation which threatened if it were prolonged to make him as mad governor of the castle of san angelo he could not eat or sleep perceptibly thinner time to time he would abruptly draw his sword and begin to at a wall shouting let him come on let him come on the villain let him come on i for him benvenuto did not come on estourville had his calmer moments too during which he would persuading himself that the goldsmith s tongue was longer than and that he would never dare to carry out his damnable schemes was at one of these moments that colombe happening to come out room observed all the warlike preparations and asked her was the occasion of them a scoundrel to be chastised that s all the provost replied it was the provost s business to chastise colombe did not even the scoundrel was whose chastisement was preparing being too with her own thoughts not to be content with this very truth messire robert with a single word had made a in his daughter s life that life hitherto so calm so simple obscure and secluded that life of peaceful days and tranquil nights like a lake whose surface is suddenly ruffled by a tempest she at times before that her soul was sleeping that her heart but she thought that her solitude was the cause of and attributed the emptiness of her heart to the fact had lost her mother in her infancy and now without warning her thoughts her heart and her soul were filled but with grief how she then sighed for the days of ignorance and tranquillity commonplace but watchful friendship of dame perrine was for her happiness the days of hope and faith when upon the future as one reckons upon a friend the days trust and confidence when she believed in the affection of alas her future now was the hateful love of comte d orbec s affection was simply ambition so disguised why instead the only inheritor of a noble name and vast fortune was she child of some obscure bourgeois of the city who would have and cherished her in that case she might have fallen in with artist in whose speech there was so much to move and fascinate handsome ascanio who seemed to have such a wealth of happiness to bestow when the rapid beating of her heart and her flushed cheeks that the stranger s image had filled her thoughts too long herself to the task of banishing the lovely dream in placing before her eyes the desolating reality since had made known to her his matrimonial plans she had dame perrine to receive ascanio upon one pretext or another to tell her father everything if she disobeyed and as fearing to be accused of complicity with him had of the hostile projects of ascanio s master poor herself to be well protected in that direction must not be supposed however that the sweet natured child to the idea of obeying her father s commands no her revolted at the thought of an alliance with this man whom have hated had she really known what hate was beneath pale brow she revolved a thousand thoughts hitherto her mind thoughts of revolt and rebellion which she looked as crimes and for which she asked god s forgiveness upon then it occurred to her to go and throw herself at the king but she had heard it whispered that the same idea had occurred de poitiers under much more terrible circumstances and that her honor there madame d etampes might protect her too if but would she choose would she not greet the complaints of child with a contemptuous smile such a smile of mockery she had seen upon her father s lips when she begged him to with him and it made a terrible impression upon her colombe had no refuge but god and she knelt before her prie dieu hundred times a day imploring the omnipotent to send succor to before the end of the three months which still separated her formidable fiancé or if she could hope for no relief to allow her at least to join her mother in heaven s existence meanwhile was no less troublous and unhappy of his beloved twenty times since raimbault had made known to order which forbade his admission to the hôtel de nesle had dreaming about the lofty walls which separated him from in the morning before anybody had risen and at night was asleep but not once either openly or furtively did to make his way into the forbidden garden he still had respect of early youth which protects the woman whom one the very passion which she may have to fear at a later period this did not prevent ascanio as he worked away at his carving from indulging in many an extravagant dream to say nothing he dreamed in his morning and evening promenades or during sleep at night these dreams were concerned more the day at first so much dreaded now so eagerly desired by him benvenuto should assume possession of the hôtel de nesle knew his master and that all this apparent tranquillity of a volcano breeding an eruption cellini had given out that would take place on the following sunday ascanio had no doubt that on the following sunday cellini s undertaking would so far as he was able to judge in his walks around the séjour the undertaking would not be accomplished without thanks to the guard which was constantly maintained upon and ascanio had observed about the hotel all the indications of post if there should be an attack there would be a defence as the fortress seemed little disposed to capitulate it was it must be taken by assault it was at that decisive moment s chivalrous nature might expect to find an opportunity itself there would be a battle there would be a breach in to carry and perhaps there would be a conflagration ah of that sort was what he longed for a conflagration most a conflagration whereby colombe s life would be endangered would dart up the tottering staircases among the burning rafters over the crumbling walls he would hear her voice calling for help would seek her out take her in his arms dying and and bear her away to safety through the roaring sea her heart against his and inhaling her breath then her safely through a thousand dangers he would lay her at of her despairing father who would reward his gallant conduct her to the man who had saved her life or else as he bore her arms over a frail plank thrown across the flaming chasm his slip and they would fall together and die in each other s arms hearts blending in one last sigh in a first and last kiss alternative was not to be despised by one who had so little his heart as ascanio for next to the felicity of living for the greatest happiness is to die together it will be seen that all our friends were passing through some days and nights with the exception of benvenuto cellini entirely to have forgotten his hostile designs upon the hôtel and of scozzone who knew nothing of them whole week passed away thus and benvenuto cellini having throughout the six days that composed it and completed the clay model of his jupiter donned his coat of the saturday about five o clock buttoned his doublet over it and ascanio accompany him bent his steps toward the hôtel when they reached the spot cellini made the circuit of spying out the weak spots and meditating his plan of siege attack offered more than one difficulty as the provost had said friend marmagne as ascanio had informed his master and was now able to see for himself the château de nesle and machicolated was defended by a double wall on the and furthermore by the city moats and ramparts on the side of aux clercs it was one of those massive and imposing which were equal to the task of defending themselves mass alone provided that the doors were securely fastened and without outside assistance the assaults of tirelaines larroneurs as they were called in those days or of the king s men need were this was often the case at that interesting epoch was generally compelled to do police duty for himself made his reconnaissance according to all the ancient and of strategy and deeming it to be his duty to summon the place before laying siege to it he knocked at the little door ascanio had once entered for him as for ascanio the small but it was the martial countenance of an archer instead of the pacific gardener which appeared in the opening what do you want the archer demanded of the stranger who dared at the door of the hôtel de nesle to take possession of the hotel which has been given to me replied the goldsmith very good wait rejoined the fellow and he went at once to d estourville as he had been ordered to do moment later he returned accompanied by the provost who did not but stood listening with bated breath in a corner part of his garrison in order to judge the better of the gravity affair we do not know what you mean said the archer if that be so said cellini hand this document to messire it is a certified copy of the deed of gift and he passed through the window sergeant disappeared a second time but as he had simply to put hand to hand the copy to the provost the window opened again here is his answer said the sergeant passing through the bars torn in pieces very good rejoined cellini with perfect tranquillity au revoir returned to his studio highly gratified by the attention with had followed his scrutiny of the place and the young man suggestions as to the coup de main they were to attempt time and he assured his pupil that he would have made general were it not that he was destined to become more distinguished artist which in cellini s view preferable next morning the sun rose in all his glory benvenuto had workmen to come to the studio although it was sunday and not them failed to appear my children said the master it is undoubtedly true that i to work at the goldsmith s trade and not to fight but during months that we have been together we have learned to know so well that in a serious emergency i feel that i can you as you all and always can count upon me you know what i contemplation we are but poorly accommodated here with but and little space and our elbows are too cramped to allow us great works or even to use the forge with any degree the king in the presence of you all deigned to bestow upon me and more commodious abode but as he has no leisure to trifling details he left it to me to install myself therein now present possessor does not choose to give over to me this his majesty has so generously presented to me therefore we it the provost of paris who retains possession in the face of s order it would seem that such things are of in this land does not know the man with whom he has to do soon as i am refused i demand as soon as i am resisted i take are you disposed to assist me i do not conceal from you will be danger in so doing there is a battle to be fought walls to be scaled and other harmless amusements to be indulged in is nothing to fear from the police or the patrol because we his majesty s authority but it may mean death my children let those who wish to go elsewhere do so without hesitation those who wish to remain here not be ashamed to say as much i none but bold and resolute hearts if you leave me to go alone and ascanio have no fear on our behalf i know not how i to work but i do know this that i will not be disappointed but by the blood of christ if you lend me your hearts and as i hope you will woe to the provost and the provostry now are fully instructed in the matter speak will you follow me all shouted with one voice anywhere master wherever you choose to lead us bravo my children then you are all in for the sport all then let the tempest howl cried benvenuto at last we are to have diversion i have been rusty long enough up up brave swords ah thank god we are soon to give and receive a few look you my dear boys look you my gallant friends we must we must agree upon a plan let them be ready to look and vive la joie i will give you all that i possess way of weapons offensive and defensive in addition to those hanging on the wall where every one can choose at will ah what need is a good culverin but there s its value in arquebuses pikes swords and daggers and there are coats of and cuirasses and helmets come haste haste and let us the ball the provost shall pay for the music hurrah cried all his companions the studio was the scene of a commotion a tumult look upon the verve and enthusiasm of the master infected and every face they tried on cuirasses brandished swords point of daggers laughed and sang as if a masquerade or some sort were in progress benvenuto ran hither and thither boot to this one buckling the belt of another and feeling the hotly and freely through his veins as if this were the life loved workmen meanwhile indulged in jokes at one another s expense freely upon the bellicose demeanor and awkward attitudes fellows look master cried one of them look at simon le gaucher 4 sword on the same side as we on the right man on the right see jehan retorted simon holding his halberd as he ll hold when he s a bishop there s pagolo putting on a double coat of mail said jehan why not replied pagolo hermann the german is arraying himself knight in the days of the emperor barbarossa fact the youth referred to by the appellation of hermann the a somewhat pleonastic title as his name alone was so in sound as to indicate that its owner belonged to some one circles of the holy empire hermann we say had covered head to foot with iron and resembled one of the gigantic the sculptors of that artistic age were accustomed to carve although the physical strength of this redoubtable beyond the rhine had become proverbial in the studio remarked would be likely to experience some difficulty in moving being encased and that his usefulness would certainly be than increased hermann s only reply was to leap upon a table as if he were clad in velvet take down an enormous hammer around his head and strike the anvil three such terrific blows of them drove it an inch into the ground there was nothing to such a reply so benvenuto waved his hand and nodded his in token of satisfaction alone made his toilet apart from the others he could not feeling of uneasiness as to the results of the enterprise upon were about to embark for it might well be that colombe would him for attacking her father especially if the struggle to some grave catastrophe and he would find himself from her heart although nearer to her eyes half joyous half anxious wept one moment and laughed the change of location and the prospect of a battle were by unpleasing to her but as for blows and wounds that was the preparations for the combat made the frolicsome for joy but its possible results made the woman that was in at last noticed her smiling and weeping at the same time went to her side thou wilt remain here scozzone with ruperta he said and for the wounded and a good dinner for those who come it oh no no cried scozzone oh pray let me go with you with you courage enough to defy the provost and all his myrmidons but with ruperta i should die of anxiety and fear oh i could never consent to that replied benvenuto it me too much to think that some mishap might befall thee pray for us dear child while awaiting our return listen benvenuto rejoined the maiden as if struck by a you understand of course that i cannot endure the thought quiet here while you are fighting yonder wounded but there is a way of satisfying both of us instead of your safety here in the studio i will go and pray in the to the spot in that way i shall be out of danger and the result immediately whether it be a victory or a defeat very well so be it replied benvenuto it is understood of course we shall not go forth to kill others or to be killed ourselves first fulfilling the pious duty of listening to mass we will to the church of the grands augustins which is nearer than to the hôtel de nesle and will leave thee there little one arrangements determined upon and the preparations for the an end they drank a glass of burgundy to the success of to their weapons offensive and defensive they tongs ladders and ropes and left the studio not after of an army corps but two by two at sufficiently long to attract attention it was not that a coup de main was a occurrence in those days than an émeute or a change in these days of ours but truth to say it was not select the sabbath day or the hour of noon for this sort and it required all benvenuto s audacity reinforced by that right was on his side to venture upon such after another our heroes arrived at the grands augustins and given their weapons and tools into the charge of the sacristan was a friend of simon le gaucher they entered the church to to the blessed sacrifice of the mass and to implore god s exterminating as many archers as possible compels us to state however that despite the gravity of crisis despite his exemplary piety and despite of the matters to which his prayers had reference no sooner entered the church than his actions indicated that was upon something very different his distraction was due to that just behind him but on the other side of the nave sat girl reading from an illuminated missal a young girl so that she might well have confused the thoughts of a saint of a sculptor under such circumstances the artist sadly the devotions of the christian the gallant cellini could the desire to have some one to join him in his admiration and who was at his left would certainly have frowned upon he turned to ascanio who was at his right with of bidding him turn his eyes toward the lovely picture ascanio s eyes needed no bidding in that direction from the he entered the church his gaze was riveted upon the maiden and never left her face seeing that he was absorbed in contemplation of the simply nudged him with his elbow yes said ascanio yes it is colombe o master is she was indeed colombe her father not anticipating an attack at had given her permission not without some reluctance to go augustins to pray colombe it is true was very earnest in for it was the only consolation that remained to her was by her side ah çà who is colombe was benvenuto s very natural query ah yes you do not know her colombe is the daughter of the provost d estourville himself is she not beautiful he said again no rejoined benvenuto no it s not colombe t is hebe ascanio goddess of youth the hebe whom my great king françois has my hands the hebe of whom i have dreamed for whom i have prayed and who has come down from above in response to my prayer of the incongruity of the idea of hebe reading her missal pouring out her heart in prayer benvenuto continued his hymn simultaneously with his devotion and his military plans the catholic and the strategist predominated in his mind our father who art in heaven look ascanio what clean cut thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is how fascinatingly graceful the undulating outline of give us this day our daily bread and thou sayest that such child is the daughter of that rascally provost whom i propose with my own hand and forgive us our trespasses as those who trespass against us even though i have to burn hôtel to do it amen benvenuto crossed himself having no doubt that he had a most expressive rendering of the lord s prayer mass came to an end while he was still absorbed in ideas which might seem somewhat profane in the case of of different temperament at a different epoch but which natural in so reckless a nature as cellini s at a time marot was putting the seven penitential psalms into soon as the ite missa est was pronounced benvenuto and a warm grasp of the hand then while the girl wiping away remained on the spot where she was to await the result of cellini and ascanio their eyes still fixed upon colombe not once looked up from her book went with their companions to drop of holy water after which they separated to meet in a cul de sac about half way from the church to the hôtel de nesle in accordance with the prearranged plan remained to of high mass as did colombe and dame perrine who arrived a little early and had listened to the first as a preparation for the more solemn ceremony to follow nor any reason to suspect that benvenuto and his apprentices were point of cutting all the lines of communication with the house so imprudently quitted and decisive moment had arrived benvenuto divided his men into one was to attempt by every possible means to force of the hôtel the other was to cover the operations of the first to keep from the walls with arquebus shots or with their swords of the besieged who might appear upon the battlements or who a sortie benvenuto took command of this last detachment and selected our friend ascanio for his lieutenant at the the other he placed hermann the good humored gallant german flatten an iron bar with a hammer and a man with his fist for his second in command little jehan a rascal of fifteen years active as a squirrel mischievous as a monkey and impudent as for whom the goliath had conceived a very deep affection for doubtless that the playful youngster was forever little jehan proudly took his place beside his captain to chagrin of pagolo who in his double cuirass was not unlike of the commandeur in the rigidity of his movements thus made his dispositions and reviewed his men and weapons for the last time benvenuto addressed a few words to fellows who were about to face danger perhaps death in with such good will then he grasped each man s hand devoutly and cried forward two parties at once took up their line of march and skirting des augustins which was deserted at that hour in that spot soon arrived at the hôtel de nesle benvenuto unwilling to attack his enemy without first all the formalities prescribed by custom in such cases alone waving a white handkerchief at the end of his sword same small door as before and knocked as before he was the barred opening as to the object of his visit the same formula saying that he had come to take possession château given him by the king but he was less fortunate than former occasion in that he was not honored with any reply at all facing the door he exclaimed in loud distinct tones to thee robert d estourville provost of paris do i goldsmith sculptor painter and engineer make known that françois i has in his good pleasure as it was his right given to me absolutely the grand nesle as thou dost thy hold upon it and in contravention of the royal will to deliver it to me i hereby declare to thee estourville seigneur de villebon provost of paris that i have take possession of the grand nesle by force defend and if evil comes of thy refusal know that thou wilt answerable therefor on earth and in heaven before man and that benvenuto paused and waited but not a sound came from walls he thereupon loaded his arquebus and ordered his men to their weapons then assembling the leaders hermann ascanio in council he said to them you see my children that it is not possible to avoid the conflict it is for us to decide in what way we shall begin the attack i will break in the door said hermann and do you follow me in s all with what will you do it my samson queried cellini looked about and saw on the quay a piece of timber which men would have found it difficult to lift with that beam he said walked to where it lay coolly picked it up placed it under his arm fixed it there like a rain in its socket then returned to a crowd was beginning to collect and benvenuto was on the point of giving orders for the attack to begin captain of the king s archers notified doubtless by citizen appeared at the corner of the street five or six mounted men this captain was a friend of the provost although he knew perfectly well what was toward he rode up hoping to intimidate him doubtless and while his hermann s advance he said what is your desire and why do you thus disturb the peace of the man who really disturbs the peace replied cellini is he to obey the king s orders not he who executes them what do you mean inquired the captain i mean that i hold a deed in due form delivered to me by messire secretary of the royal treasury wherein his majesty me the hôtel du grand nesle but the people who are in to recognize this deed and thereby keep me from my own now way or another i have got it into my head that since that we must render unto cæsar the things that are cæsar s cellini is entitled to take what belongs to yes and instead of preventing us from taking possession of you ought to lend us a hand cried pagolo be silent rascal said benvenuto stamping angrily i have no anybody s assistance dost thou understand you are right in theory but wrong in practice rejoined the captain how may that be demanded benvenuto who felt that the blood to rise in his cheeks you are right to wish to enter into possession of your property are wrong to undertake to do it in this way for you will not i promise you fighting walls with your swords if i were to a little friendly advice it would be to apply to the officers and carry your grievance to the provost of paris for example that adieu and good luck to you the captain of the king s archers rode away with a sneering laugh the crowd laughed too he laughs best who laughs last said benvenuto cellini forward forward took up his joist once more and while cellini ascanio and three of the most skilful marksmen of the party arquebus in hand in readiness to fire upon the wall he rushed forward like catapult against the small door which they deemed to be burst in than the large one when he approached the wall a shower of stones began to rain him although no defenders could be seen for the provost stones to be piled on top of the wall and it was necessary push lightly against the piles to send them down upon the heads besiegers latter being thus warmly received recoiled a step or two but taken entirely by surprise by this alarming method of defence one was wounded save pagolo he was so overburdened with his that he could not fall back so quickly as the others and in the heel himself was no more disturbed by this shower of pebbles than tree by a hail storm and kept on to the door where he at once work and began to deal such blows against it that it soon that stout as it was it could not long withstand and his men meanwhile stood ready with their arquebuses upon anybody who might appear upon the wall but no one appeared grand nesle seemed to be defended by an invisible garrison raged inwardly at his inability to do anything to assist german suddenly he happened to glance at the old tour which stood by itself as we have said on the other side of and bathed its feet in the seine wait hermann cried cellini wait my good fellow the hôtel is ours as surely as my name is benvenuto cellini and i am by trade to ascanio and his two companions to follow him he ran to while hermann in obedience to his orders stepped back out of the stones and awaited the fulfilment of the general leaning upon his timber as a swiss would lean upon his halberd benvenuto anticipated the provost had neglected to station a the old tower so that he took possession of it unopposed and up the stairs four at a leap reached the summit in a moment terrace overlooked the walls of the grand nesle as a a town so that the besieged who a moment before by their ramparts suddenly found themselves report of an arquebus and the hissing of a bullet followed by of an archer warned the provost that the face of affairs was probability about to change the same moment hermann realizing that he would now have a resumed his joist and began to batter away again at the door the besieged had strengthened somewhat during the of hostilities crowd with the marvellous instinct of self possession in such bodies realized that shooting was to form part entertainment and that spectators of the tragedy about to were likely to be splashed with blood and they no sooner report of benvenuto s arquebus and the cry of the wounded they dispersed like a flock of pigeons single individual remained was no other than our friend jacques aubry the student who the appointment made the preceding sunday with ascanio in the enjoying his game of tennis had but to east a glance over the battle field to understand what on is not difficult to divine the determination arrived at by from what we have already seen of his character to play or with fire arms was equally sport to him and as he the besiegers were most likely to be his friends he enlisted banner well my boys he said walking up to the group which was waiting door to be burst in to rush into the citadel we are having a a siege are we peste you re not attacking a cabin and it s deal of an undertaking for so few of you to try to take a like this we are not alone said pagolo who was dressing his heel and to benvenuto and his three or four companions who were such a well sustained fire upon the wall that the stones were less freely than at first i see i see master achilles said jacques aubry for you are in being wounded in the heel in addition to a thousand other similarity no doubt i see yes there s my friend ascanio and doubtless on top of the tower yonder very true said pagolo and that fellow banging away at the door so lustily is one of you also t he that s hermann said little jehan proudly peste how he goes on said the student i must go and sauntered along with his hands in his pockets regardless of whistling above his head to the brave german who kept at with the regularity of a machine do you need anything my dear goliath said jacques aubry i am service i am thirsty replied hermann without pausing in his work peste i can well believe it that s thirsty work you re doing there i wish i had a cask of beer to offer you water said hermann water do you mean that mild beverage will satisfy you so be it is at hand and you shall be served in a moment ran to the river filled his helmet with water and took it german he leaned his beam against the wall swallowed at a that the helmet contained and handed it back to the student empty thanks he said and taking up the beam once more he resumed instant later he said go and tell the master to be in readiness we are getting on famously here aubry started for the tower and in a very few moments he ascanio and benvenuto who were keeping up such a brisk fire that they had already shot down two or three men and s archers were beginning to think twice before upon the walls as hermann had sent word to benvenuto the door was yield and the provost resolved to make one last effort he his men to such good purpose that the stones began to rain down but two or three arquebus shots speedily calmed anew the ardor besieged who despite all messire robert s promises coyly remained out of range thereupon messire appeared alone carrying in his hands an enormous stone ready to hurl it down upon hermann s head benvenuto was not the man to allow his retainer to be taken as soon as he caught sight of the provost rashly no one else ventured to go he put his weapon to his shoulder have been all up with messire robert had not ascanio just pulled the trigger thrown up the barrel with a quick motion hand accompanied by a sharp exclamation so that the bullet through the air ascanio had recognized colombe s father benvenuto turned furiously upon him to demand an explanation thrown with all the force the provost could impart to it upon hermann s helmet even the enormous strength of the was not equal to the task of sustaining such a blow he hold of the timber threw out his arms as if seeking something to and finding nothing within reach fell to the with a terrible crash and besiegers simultaneously set up a shout little jehan or four comrades who were near hermann ran to him to carry from the wall and look to his injuries but the large and of the hôtel de nesle opened at the same moment and the provost the head of twelve or fifteen men darted upon the wounded man and slashing vigorously as did all his followers so that his comrades were forced to retreat although benvenuto was them to hold their ground and that he would come and help them seized the opportunity eight of his men lifted hermann who unconscious by the arms and legs and seven took up a position their retreat so that while cellini ascanio and their four comrades on the terrace of the tower were hurrying down the five flights of stairs which lay between them and the street his bearers re entered the grand nesle when cellini arquebus appeared at the door of the tower the door of the hôtel was behind the last of the provost s men at arms was no disguising the fact that this was a check and a at that cellini ascanio and their comrades had it is true three or four of the besieged but the loss of these three men was much less disastrous to the provost than was the loss to cellini besiegers were dazed for a moment ascanio and cellini looked at each other as if by a i have a plan said cellini looking to the left that is to say the city and so have i ascanio rejoined looking to the right that is to say the fields i have devised a plan to bring the garrison out of the castle and i a plan to open the door for you if you do bring them out how many men do you need a single one will suffice choose will you come with me jacques aubry said ascanio to the end of the world my dear fellow to the end of the world but t be sorry to have some sort of a weapon the end of a sword or a suspicion of a dagger four or five inches of steel my way with if occasion requires oh take pagolo s sword said ascanio he can t use it for he his heel with his right hand and crossing himself with and here s my own dagger to complete your outfit said cellini strike with it all you please young man but do not leave it in it would be altogether too handsome a present to the wounded man the hilt was carved by myself and is worth a hundred golden crowns it is worth a sou and the blade queried jacques aubry the hilt is very valuable but at such a time the blade is of the greatest importance to the blade is priceless rejoined benvenuto with it i killed s murderer bravo cried the student come ascanio let s be off i am ready said ascanio winding five or six lengths of rope body and putting one of the ladders over his shoulder i two venturesome youths walked along the quay a hundred yards then turned to the left and disappeared around the the wall of the grand nesle behind the city moat us leave ascanio to carry out his scheme and follow cellini in of his objects upon which his eyes rested when as we have said he the left that is in the direction of the city were two women amid a group of timid spectators at some little distance in whom he thought he recognized the provost s daughter and were in fact colombe and dame perrine who after hearing mass to return to the petit nesle and had come to a stand still in trembling with alarm on account of what they had heard of that was in progress and of what they saw with their own eyes colombe no sooner perceived that there was a momentary cessation which left the road open for her than heedless of of dame perrine who begged her not to risk her safety in she went forward resolutely impelled by her anxiety for and leaving dame perrine entirely free to follow her or where she was as the duenna was really deeply attached to she determined to accompany her notwithstanding her fright left the group just as ascanio and jacques aubry turned the the wall benvenuto cellini s plan may be divined soon as he saw the two women coming toward him he himself to meet them and gallantly offered his arm to colombe have no fear madame he said if you will deign to accept my arm escort you to your father hesitated but dame perrine seized the arm on her side had forgotten to offer her take his arm my dear take it she said and let us accept knight s protection look look there is monsieur le prévôt over the wall he is anxious about us no doubt took benvenuto s arm and the three walked to within a step of the door cellini stopped and said to the provost in a loud voice that colombe s arm and dame perrine s were safely within his own monsieur le prévôt your daughter who is here desires to enter that you will open the door to her unless you prefer to leave a hostage in your enemy s hands times within two hours the provost behind his ramparts of his daughter whom he had so imprudently allowed to go out in considerable doubt as to the possibility of admitting he was hoping that she would be warned in time and would be to go to the grand châtelet and await results when he leave his companions and go to meet two women in whom colombe and dame perrine the little fool he muttered beneath his breath but i can t in the midst of these miscreants opened the wicket and showed his face behind the grating well said he what are your terms these said benvenuto i will allow madame colombe and her enter but only on condition that you come forth with all your men we will then decide our dispute by a fair fight in the open remain in possession of the battle field shall have the hôtel vœ victis as your compatriot brennus said i accept said the provost on one condition what is it that you and your people stand back to give my daughter time to come my archers time to go out agreed said cellini but do you come out first and let go in afterward when she is safely inside you will throw over the wall to her and thus leave yourself no opportunity agreed said the provost your word on the faith of a gentleman and yours on the faith of benvenuto cellini terms being agreed upon the door opened and the provost filed out and drew up in two rows before the door estourville at their head they were nineteen in all on the benvenuto without ascanio hermann and jacques aubry had men remaining and of these simon le gaucher was wounded the right hand but benvenuto was not given to counting his foes be remembered that he did not hesitate to attack handed although he was attended by a dozen sbirri he was glad therefore to abide by his agreement for he desired much as a general and decisive action you may go in now madame he said to his fair prisoner flew across the space which lay between the two camps as the bird whose name she bore and threw herself panting into s arms father father she cried weeping in heaven s name do not go inside said the provost sharply taking her by the arm her to the door t is your folly that reduces us to passed through the door followed by dame perrine to whom lent if not wings as to her lovely ward at least legs which she had lost ten years before provost closed the door behind them the key the key cried cellini to his promise the provost took the key from the lock and threw the wall so that it fell into the courtyard and now cried benvenuto rushing upon the provost and his troop every man for himself and god for us all terrible struggle ensued for before the provost s people had time their weapons and fire benvenuto with his seven workmen was midst slashing to right and left with the terrible sword which in such masterly fashion and which forged by his own hand coats of mail or breastplates able to resist it the cast aside their useless arquebuses drew their swords to cut and thrust in return but despite their numbers and in less time than it takes to write the words they all about the square and two or three of the bravest severely that they could tight no longer were forced to fall back provost saw the danger and being a brave man who in his time some fame as a fighting man he rushed forward to confront benvenuto cellini whom nobody seemed able to withstand to me he cried to me infamous robber and let us decide what say you oh i could ask nothing better replied benvenuto if you will people not to interfere with us i am your man stand where you are said the provost to his men let not one of you stir said cellini to his the combatants on either side stood rooted in their places motionless like the homeric warriors who ceased their own order to miss no part of a contest between two renowned chiefs the provost and cellini each of whom already held his in his hand attacked each other at the same instant provost was a clever fencer but cellini s skill in that of the very first order for ten or twelve years past the not once had occasion to draw his sword on the other hand same ten or twelve years hardly a day had passed that not had or made an occasion to draw his at the outset therefore provost who had counted a little too much upon his own prowess conscious of his enemy s superiority for his part meeting with a resistance which he from a man of the robe exerted all the energy activity cunning of which he was capable it was a marvellous thing to sword which like the triple sting of a serpent threatened and the heart at the same instant flying from place to place giving his adversary time to parry much less to make a and so the provost realizing that he had to do with than himself began to give ground still defending himself unluckily for messire robert his back was toward the wall a very few steps brought him up against the door for which aimed although he was well aware that he had thrown over the wall he reached that point he felt that he was lost and like a at bay he summoned all his strength and delivered three or blows in such rapid succession that it was benvenuto s turn once indeed he was a second too late and his adversary s his breast despite the excellent coat of mail he wore but wounded lion bent upon speedy vengeance benvenuto the moment that the sharp point of the sword gathered himself for a spring have run the provost through with a deadly lunge had not the him suddenly given way at that moment so that estourville fell over backwards and the sword came in contact individual who had saved him by opening the door so unexpectedly the result was different from what might have been expected for man said nothing while benvenuto gave utterance to a he had recognized ascanio in the man whom he had he had no eyes for hermann or for jacques aubry who his victim like a madman he threw his arms around the s neck seeking the wound with his eyes and his hand and his mouth crying slain slain slain by my hand ascanio my child i have killed thee roaring and weeping as lions roar and weep hermann extricated the provost unharmed from s and cellini s legs and taking him under his arm as he done with a baby deposited him in a little house where his gardening tools he locked the door upon him drew his sword assumed a posture indicative of his purpose to defend his any one who might undertake to recapture him aubry made but one bound from the pavement to the top of brandishing his dagger triumphantly and shouting blow blow the grand nesle is ours all these surprising things had come to pass the reader in the following chapter footnote 4 left handed the advantage of fortified hôtel de nesle on the side bounded by the pré aux clercs defended by its walls and by the city moat so that on that was considered impregnable now ascanio very sensibly reflected is seldom deemed necessary to guard what cannot be taken and to make an attack upon the point where the besieged had of providing against one that object in view he set out with his friend jacques aubry that as he disappeared in one direction colombe would the other and provide benvenuto with a means of compelling to adopt a course which he was most reluctant to adopt s scheme was very difficult of execution and very dangerous possible results he proposed to cross a deep moat scale a five feet high and at the end perhaps fall into the midst of not till he arrived at the brink of the moat and of did he realize the difficulty of crossing the one through the other and then his determination firm as it the outset wavered for an instant aubry halted some ten or twelve paces behind his friend tranquilly gazing from the wall to the moat having measured with his eye he said i beg you my dear fellow to have the kindness to inform me why me hither unless it be to fish for frogs ah yes you glance ladder very good i understand but your ladder is only long while the wall is twenty five feet high and the moat which makes a difference of twenty three feet if my reckoning was taken aback for a moment by this unanswerable arithmetic suddenly he cried striking his forehead with his hand ah i have an idea look where there said ascanio there that s not an idea you are pointing at rejoined the student but tree was in truth a huge oak growing near the outer edge of the moat upper branches of which gazed inquisitively over the wall of de nesle what don t you understand cried ascanio yes yes i begin to see through it now yes it s the very thing it all the oak and the wall form part of the arch of a bridge ladder will complete but the abyss yawns beneath my friend abyss full of mud the devil we mustn t forget that i am best clothes and simonne s husband is beginning to grumble me credit help me to hoist the ladder said ascanio that s all i ask of you aha said the student and i am to stay below thanks of them seized a branch and they were soon in the tree by strength they succeeded in pulling the ladder up after them top of the tree where they lowered it like a drawbridge and their intense satisfaction that while one end rested firmly upon branch the other end extended two or three feet beyond the wall but when we are upon the wall what are we to do aubry inquired why when we re upon the wall we will pull the ladder after us and by it very good there is only one trifling difficulty and that is that is twenty five feet high and the ladder only twelve i have provided for that said ascanio unwinding the rope from he then made one end fast to the trunk of the tree and threw over the wall ah great man i understand you cried aubry and i am proud to break my neck with you very well what do you propose to do go across and aubry prepared to cross the space that lay between the wall no no said ascanio it is my place to go first which finger is wet said aubry holding out his hand to his two fingers open and two closed so be it said ascanio touching one of the two closed fingers you have won said aubry go on but keep cool don t get excited never fear started out upon the flying bridge while jacques aubry by sitting upon the end the ladder was a frail support but youth was light the student hardly daring to breathe he wavered for an instant but he passed quickly over the that separated him from the wall and arrived there safe he was still in very great danger if any of the besieged to espy him but his anticipations were verified no one in sight he shouted to his companion no one if that is so said aubry on with the dance he ventured upon the narrow trembling path while ascanio whole weight upon the other end of the ladder repaid the him as he was as light and as active as ascanio he was at in an instant of them sat astride the wall and drew the ladder across they fast the other end of the rope to it and lowered it swinging so that the lower end would rest on the ground at a safe the wall lastly ascanio who had won the privilege of took the rope in both hands and slid down until his upon the topmost round of the ladder another second and he the ground aubry followed him with similar good fortune and the found themselves in the garden was plainly advisable for them to act at once all their taken considerable time and ascanio was fearful lest his aubry s had been prejudicial to the master s interests swords as they ran they hastened to the door leading into courtyard where the garrison should be assuming that they changed their position when they reached the door ascanio put to the keyhole and saw that the courtyard was empty benvenuto has succeeded he cried the garrison has gone out is ours and he tried to open the door which proved to of the young men put forth all their strength in an effort to this way this way exclaimed a voice which found an echo s heart this way monsieur turned and saw colombe at a window on the ground floor in two was at her side aha exclaimed jacques aubry following him it seems that we in the citadel aha you didn t tell me that my boy oh save my father monsieur ascanio cried colombe without of surprise at the young man s appearance and as if were the most natural thing in the world they are do you know and it s all for me all on my account o mon dieu grant that they kill not one another have no fear said ascanio darting into the apartment which had leading into the little courtyard have no fear i will answer have no fear said jacques aubry following at his heels have we will answer for everything he entered the room ascanio heard his name called a second time a voice much less musical than the other who calls me he said i my young friend the same voice replied with a most accent pardieu cried aubry t is our goliath what the deuce are you that hen roost he added looking through the window of s shed at which he saw a face which he recognized s i haf found myself here but i know not how i haf here come draw that i may go and fight quick quick quick my hand itches there you are said the student rendering hermann the service ascanio was hurrying toward the door opening on the quay he could hear a tremendous clashing of swords when naught but of the wood separated him from the combatants he feared that he showed himself at that moment he might fall into the hands of so he first looked out through the grated wicket there he facing him eager excited and thirsting for the blood of and realized that messire robert was lost he picked up which lay on the ground opened the door quickly and thinking save his promise to colombe received in his shoulder the but for him would inevitably have transfixed the provost have already witnessed the result of that occurrence benvenuto threw himself upon ascanio s neck hermann imprisoned in the same cage from which he had just been set free himself jacques aubry perched upon the rampart flapped his wings lustily in honor of the victory victory was in very truth complete the provost s people when was made prisoner did not even try to dispute it but laid arms the goldsmiths all entered the courtyard of the grand nesle their property and secured the door behind them archers and sergeants outside however took no part in the latter proceedings he ascanio in his arms having removed his coat of mail torn away and finally reached the wound and was stanching the flow with his handkerchief my ascanio my child he said again and again wounded wounded what will thy mother in heaven say forgive me stefana forgive me thou in pain tell me does my hand hurt thee will this never stop a surgeon quickly pray will not some one call aubry ran out of the courtyard at the top of his speed it is nothing dear master it is nothing said ascanio a on my arm don t feel so terribly for i assure you it surgeon brought to the hotel by jacques aubry five minutes later ascanio s assurance that the wound was not dangerous deep and at once set about bandaging it ah what a weight you lift from my heart said cellini then i am murderer dear child but what is the matter my ascanio thy beating madly and the blood rushing to thy face o monsieur we must take him away from here the fever is laying him no no master said ascanio on the contrary i feel much better me here leave me here i implore you my father suddenly inquired a voice behind benvenuto which made what have you done with my father turned and saw colombe pale and rigid seeking the her glance as she asked for him with her voice oh he is safe and sound mademoiselle safe and sound thanks be cried ascanio thanks be to this poor boy who received the blow intended for him benvenuto for you may truly say that this gallant fellow life monsieur le prévôt how s this where are you exclaimed cellini looking about for the provost he could not understand he is here master said hermann where pray here in the little prison o monsieur benvenuto cried colombe darting to the shed with of mingled entreaty and reproach open hermann said cellini obeyed and the provost appeared in the doorway by his misadventure colombe threw herself into his arms o father father she cried are you not wounded has no you and as she spoke she looked at ascanio no said the provost in his harsh voice no thank heaven happened to me and and queried colombe in a faltering tone is it true that i cannot deny that he arrived at just the right time yes interposed cellini yes at the right time to receive the which i intended for you monsieur le prévôt yes yes he added you owe your father s life to this and if monsieur le prévôt doesn t proclaim it from he is an ingrate as well as a liar i trust that his rescuer will not have to pay too dearly for rejoined colombe blushing at her own audacity o mademoiselle cried ascanio i would gladly have shed all my such a cause well well messire le prévôt said cellini see what you have caused to spring up but ascanio may not be able the excitement the bandage is in place and it would be well i think to take a little rest now benvenuto had said to the provost of the service rendered him wounded man was no more than the truth and as every truth has strength of its own the provost in his heart could but he owed his life to ascanio he therefore put a good face on and approached the wounded man saying young man an apartment in my hotel is at your service in your hotel messire robert exclaimed cellini with a laugh good humor returned as his anxiety on ascanio s account vanished in your hotel why do you really wish to begin the battle over again what cried the provost do you claim the right to turn my myself out of doors by no means messire you now occupy the petit nesle very good petit nesle and let us live on such terms as good neighbors should good enough messire to make no opposition to ascanio s being made comfortable in the grand nesle where we will join him thereafter if you prefer war o father cried colombe no peace said the provost there can be no peace without conditions monsieur le prévôt do honor to accompany me to the grand nesle or the favor to receive the petit and we will draw up our treaty i will go with you monsieur said the provost so be it mademoiselle said d estourville then to his daughter be good return to your apartments and await my return there notwithstanding the harsh tone in which this command presented her forehead to her father to kiss and with addressed to everybody present so that ascanio might come a share of it she withdrew followed her with his eyes until she disappeared as there further to detain him in the courtyard he asked to be hermann thereupon took him under the arms as if he were a child transported him to the grand nesle on my word messire robert said benvenuto who had also looked maiden while she was in sight on my word you were very send my late prisoner away and i thank you for the precaution honor i do i am free to say that mademoiselle colombe s have been prejudicial to my interests by making me too weak willing to forget that i am a victor to remember simply that i artist that is to say a lover of every perfect form and of beauty d estourville acknowledged the compliment by a contortion of his features he followed the goldsmith without outwardly manifesting his ill humor but mumbling beneath his breath cellini to put the finishing touch to begged him to go over his new abode with him was conveyed in such courteous terms that it was decline the provost therefore accompanied his neighbor who no mercy and left not a corner of the garden nor a room in unvisited ah this is truly magnificent said benvenuto when they had tour of inspection during which they were actuated by emotions now monsieur le prévôt i can understand your repugnance to give up this property but i need not say will be most welcome whenever you may choose as to day to do honor of calling upon me in my poor abode you forget monsieur that i am here to day for no other purpose listen to your conditions and state my own i am ready to listen how so messire robert on the contrary i am at your service but choose to allow me first to make known my wishes to you you be free to give expression to your own say on first of all the one essential clause what is that it is this article i messire robert d estourville doth concede s right to the property called the grand nesle doth it to him and doth renounce all claim thereto forever and his heirs accepted said the provost but if it should please the king to you what he has now taken from me and to give to some other has now given to you i am not to be held responsible ouais said cellini there s some mischievous mental in that monsieur le prévôt but no matter i shall know how what i have won let us pass to the next t is my turn said the provost that is no more than fair article ii benvenuto cellini agrees to make no attack upon nesle which is and is to remain the property of estourville furthermore he will not even attempt to gain a as a neighbor and under the guise of friendship very good said benvenuto although the clause is by no in kindness but if the door is thrown open to me i shall myself so devoid of courtesy as to refuse to enter i will give orders to avert that possibility retorted the provost let us to the next i continue article iii the first courtyard between the grand and petit nesles be common to both estates that is quite right said benvenuto and you will do me the believe that if mademoiselle colombe desires to go out i shall her a prisoner oh never fear my daughter will go in and out by a door which to have cut in the wall i simply wish to make sure of for carriages and wagons is that all yes replied messire robert apropos he added i trust that allow me to remove my furniture that is no more than fair your furniture is yours as the grand mine now messire le prévôt let us add one more clause to a clause purely benevolent in its purpose state it article iv and last messire robert d estourville and lay aside all ill will and loyally and sincerely agree to peace i accept the article but only in so far as it does not bind me to to you against those who may attack you i agree to do nothing you but i do not agree to make myself agreeable to you as to that monsieur le prévôt you know perfectly well that i myself alone do you not if there is no objection now on added cellini passing the pen to him sign monsieur sign i will sign said the provost suiting the action word and each of the contracting parties retained a copy of formality at an end messire d estourville returned to nesle being in great haste to scold poor colombe for her colombe hung her head and let him say what he chose a single word of his reproaches for during all the time endured the girl was engrossed by a single longing to ask for news of ascanio but it was useless try as hard as she could not force the wounded youth s name beyond her lips these things were taking place on one side of the wall on side catherine who had been sent for from the church made into the grand nesle the fascinating madcap threw herself s arms pressed ascanio s hand complimented hermann of pagolo laughed wept sang asked questions all in the she had suffered terribly for the reports of fire arms her ears and interrupted her prayers again and again but was all right everybody had come out safe and sound from save four dead and three wounded men and scozzone s did homage to both victory and victors the uproar caused by catherine s arrival had subsided in ascanio remembered the motive which brought the student to so opportunely he turned to benvenuto and said master my comrade jacques aubry and i were to try our hands at a tennis to day in good sooth i am hardly in condition to be as our friend hermann says he has assisted us so gallantly undertaking however that i venture to beg you to take my place with all my heart said benvenuto but you must look to yourself jacques aubry i will try i will try messire we shall sup together afterward and you know that the victor will to drink two bottles more than his vanquished opponent which means that i shall be carried home dead drunk master benvenuto vive la joie this suits me ah the devil there s simonne me too pshaw i had to wait for her last sunday it s her day so much the worse for her that the two seized balls and rackets and hied them to the garden magpies and this was the blessed sabbath day benvenuto did nothing more tennis rest after playing and inspect his new property but following day the work of moving began and was fully completed later by virtue of the assistance of his new companions on day benvenuto resumed his modelling as calmly as if nothing the provost realized that he was definitively vanquished when that benvenuto s studio tools and workmen were at the grand nesle rage took possession of him once more began to plot and plan for vengeance he was in one of his moments when the vicomte de marmagne surprised him on of this same third day wednesday marmagne could not resist to gratify his vanity by triumphing over the sorrows of his friends as every man who is a coward and an idiot do well he said i told you so my dear provost ah is it you viscount good morning well was i right or wrong alas right are you well at all events i have no reason to reproach myself in this i gave you sufficient warning has the king returned to the louvre nonsense you said a workman a nobody a fine sight it will be have seen it my poor friend i asked you if his majesty has returned from fontainebleau yes and he keenly regrets not having reached paris on sunday in look on from one of his towers at his goldsmith s victory over what is said at court why they say that you were thoroughly whipped hum said the provost who began to be annoyed by this how was it did he really give you such an ignominious whipping why he killed two of your men did he not i think so if you wish to replace them i have two italian bravos men who are quite at your service you will have to pay but they are sure men we shall see i won t say no if not for myself i may require them son in law comte d orbec whatever they may say i cannot believe that this benvenuto personally who says so everybody some are indignant like myself others laugh like enough we have not seen the end of this affair ah you were very wrong to compromise yourself with such a clown such a paltry affair i shall fight for my honor henceforth if there had been a woman in the affair why you might properly your sword against such people but for a mere place to the hôtel de nesle is a place for princes to sleep in agreed but even so think of exposing yourself for such a matter to by a blackguard ah i have an idea marmagne said the provost parbleu you are to me that i long to render you a friendly service and i to have the opportunity now for a nobleman and secretary king you are wretchedly located on rue de la huchette my now i recently requested for a friend of mine from d etampes who refuses nothing that i ask apartments in of the king s palaces as my friend might select i obtained for him not without difficulty but it so happens that he called to spain on urgent business i have therefore at my document signed by the king containing this grant of apartments make use of it myself will you have it i should be happy thus your services and your generous friendship dear d estourville how can i ever repay you it is quite true that living in very unsuitable quarters and i have complained to the score of times i shall insist upon one condition what is that that inasmuch as you are at liberty to take your choice among all hotels you will choose go on i am waiting the hôtel de nesle aha you were laying a trap for me not at all and to show you that i am speaking seriously here is duly signed by his majesty with the necessary blanks for of the beneficiary and of the place selected i will write du grand nesle and leave you to insert such names as but this damned benvenuto is entirely off his guard relying upon a treaty we entered into whoever cares to enter will find the doors open and if on he will find the rooms empty in any event it s not a matter benvenuto out but simply of sharing the grand nesle with him it is quite large enough for three or four families benvenuto reason well what are you doing now i am writing my names and titles in the grant do you see beware benvenuto is more to be feared than you think bah i will take my two fire eaters and surprise him some sunday what compromise yourself with a clown for such a trifling matter a victor is always right and then too i shall be avenging a friend good luck to you then i have given you fair warning marmagne thanks twice over once for the gift and once for the warning marmagne delighted beyond measure thrust the precious paper in and set out in all haste to make sure of his two bravos very good said messire d estourville rubbing his hands and him go on viscount and one of two things will come either you will avenge me for benvenuto s victory or avenge me for your sarcasm in any case i shall be the gainer my enemies of each other let them fight and kill i every blow on either side for all will be equally gratifying us now cross the seine and look in upon the occupants of nesle and see how they were employing their time pending of the provost s militant hatred in the tranquil confidence of conscious strength had the work he had in hand without suspecting or caring d estourville s animosity his day was divided thus he rose and went at once to a small isolated room that he in the garden above the foundry with a window from could look obliquely into the flower garden of the petit nesle he worked during the forenoon upon the model of a small statue after dinner that is to say at one o clock in the afternoon to the studio and worked at his jupiter in the evening he played a game of tennis or went for a walk let us see how catherine employed her time she sewed and sang hither and thither instinct with joyous life much more at her the grand nesle than at the cardinal of ferrara s palace whose wound made it impossible for him to work did not time irksome notwithstanding the activity of his mind for he now availing ourselves of the thief s privilege of climbing walls enter the petit nesle this is what we shall see there in the colombe in her chamber dreaming like ascanio we beg leave here for the moment all that we can say is that while ascanio were rose colored poor colombe s were black as night and is dame perrine just setting out to market and we must if follow her for an instant a long time so at least it seems to us we have lost sight of dame indeed it must be said that courage was not virtue and amid the perilous encounters we have had purposely kept herself out of sight but when peace began once more the roses reappeared in her cheeks and as his artistic labors she peaceably resumed her joyous humor her gossip s inquisitiveness in a word the practice the excellent housewifely qualities perrine on her way to market was obliged to pass across the for the new door for the petit nesle was not yet made now by the merest chance that ruperta benvenuto s servant was setting out at precisely the same moment to master s dinner these two estimable individuals were much too to each other to share the antipathies of their masters so along together on the best possible terms and as the longest road by half they talked began by inquiring of dame perrine the price of and the names of the dealers in the quarter from that to more interesting subjects is your master such a terrible man queried dame perrine terrible when you don t offend him he is as gentle as a jesus but when one doesn t do as he wishes i must say that he s not he is fond oh very fond of having his own way that s and when he once gets a thing in his head all the five devils in hell can t drive if out but you can lead him like by pretending to obey him and it s very pleasant to hear you should hear him say to me dame ruperta he calls in his strange pronunciation although my real name is ruperte your service dame ruperta this is an excellent leg of mutton to a turn dame ruperta your beans are seasoned most triumphantly ruperta i look upon you as the queen of governesses and so winningly that it touches one to the heart à la bonne heure but he kills people they say oh yes when he s crossed he kills very handily it s a custom of but it s only when he s attacked and then only defence otherwise he is very light hearted and prepossessing i haven t seen him myself he has red hair hasn t he no indeed his hair is as black as yours and mine as mine was all you have never seen him well just come in casually some borrow something and i ll show him to you he s a handsome man make a superb archer apropos of handsome men how is our comely youth to day the i mean the attractive young apprentice who received such wound in saving the provost s life ascanio pray do you know him do i know him he promised my young mistress colombe and myself to his jewels remind him of it if you please my dear madame but doesn t answer my question and colombe will be very glad to her father s savior is out of danger oh you can tell her that he is doing very well he got up just now the surgeon has forbidden his leaving his room although i think of fresh air would do him a world of good it s out of though in this burning sun your grand nesle garden is desert not a shaded spot anywhere no vegetation but briers and four or five leafless trees it s enormous but to walk in our master consoles himself with tennis but isn t well enough yet to hold a racket and must be bored he s so active the dear boy i speak of him in that way s my favorite and is always courteous to his ciders he s not bear of a pagolo or catherine the giddy pate and you say that the poor fellow must be eating his heart out with having to pass whole days on a his bedroom mon dieu exclaimed kind hearted dame perrine pray tell the poor come over to the petit nesle where there is such beautiful shade gladly admit him although messire le prévôt has it why it would be most virtuous in me to disobey him to benefit the man who saved his life and you talk of ennui the ones who are drying up with it the comely apprentice us he will tell us tales of his italy and show us his bracelets and chatter with colombe young folks like to be prattle and they languish in solitude so it s agreed isn t it tell your benjamin that he s at liberty to come and walk in whenever he pleases provided he comes alone or with you to give him your arm knock four times the first three the last louder i shall know what it means and i will come the door thanks for ascanio and myself i will not fail to tell him of offer and he will not fail to avail himself of it i am delighted to think so dame ruperte au revoir dame perrine charmed to have made the acquaintance an estimable person the same to you dame ruperte two gossips bowed low to each other and parted with gardens of the séjour de nesle were in truth as ruperta said scorched on one side of the wall cool and shady as a forest on the provost s miserly instinct led him to leave the garden of nesle uncared for as the cost of keeping it in condition been considerable and he was not sufficiently sure of his title perhaps for the benefit of his successor the trees which he no time in cutting down as soon as he took possession s presence at the petit nesle accounted for his leaving thickets there untouched as the poor child had no than to sit beneath them raimbault and his two to keep colombe s garden in order and even to embellish was laid out and planted in extremely good taste at the back was garden dame perrine s kingdom along the wall dividing it grand nesle colombe had her flower garden called by dame morning avenue because the sun s early rays fell full upon it was the time ordinarily selected by colombe to water and roses let us note in passing that from the room foundry in the grand nesle one could see every movement of gardener without being seen following out dame perrine nomenclature there was the noonday avenue terminated by where colombe loved to sit and read or embroider during of the day at the other end of the garden was the evening avenue with a triple row of lindens which made it delightfully fresh it was here that colombe was accustomed to walk after supper last named avenue dame perrine had in mind as a spot well hasten the convalescence of the wounded ascanio she was however to say nothing to colombe of her it was possible that she would be too obedient to s commands and would refuse to concur in her governess s of them and in that case what would dame ruperta think of s authority and influence no since she had gone so far a little recklessly she must go on to the end indeed the s offence was excusable when we reflect that she had no one to whom she could speak from morning till night and more not colombe was so deeply absorbed in her own thoughts that she reply reader will readily understand ascanio s ecstasy when he paradise was open to him and how fervently he blessed ruperta upon availing himself of his good fortune on the instant had all the difficulty in the world in persuading him that at least to wait until evening he had every reason to dame perrine s suggestion was made with colombe s sanction thought made him mad with joy with how great impatience mingled with vague alarm did he count the dragging hours at last the clock struck five the apprentices left the studio had been away since noon and was believed to have gone to ruperta said solemnly to the apprentice who gazed at her had not been gazed at for many a year now that the time has come follow me young man crossed the courtyard together and she knocked four times at leading into the precincts of the petit nesle say nothing of this to the master good ruperta said ascanio that cellini was a good deal of a scoffer and sceptic in the love and did not choose to have his pure flame profaned by was on the point of making inquiries as to the reason for which it would be hard for her to obey when the door dame perrine appeared come in my fine fellow she said how are you to day pallor do you know it s a pleasure to look at you come in also take the path to the left young man colombe is just to the garden it s the time when she always walks do you try her not to scold me too severely for admitting you what cried ascanio mademoiselle colombe doesn t know no indeed do you think she would have consented to disobey her father have brought her up on correct principles i disobeyed for both faith i don t care we can t always live like hermits won t see anything or if he does i have a way to make his tongue if worse comes to worst it won t be the first time held my own against monsieur le prévôt perrine was very loquacious concerning her master but followed her in what she said ascanio was standing still to nothing save the beating of ids heart he did however these words let fall by dame perrine as they moved away this is the path where colombe walks every evening and she will here without doubt you see that the sun won t reach you here invalid expressed his thanks with a gesture and walked forward a once more immersed in his reverie and anticipating what was with mingled anxiety and impatience he heard dame perrine say as they walked along this is colombe s favorite bench upon that he left the two gossips to continue their walk and and sat softly down without a word upon the sacred seat was his purpose whither was he going he had no idea he because she was young and fair and he was young and fair thought had ever entered his head in connection with her near her was his only desire for the rest he put his trust in god rather he did not look so far into the future there is morrow in love for her part had thought more than once and in spite of the young stranger who had appeared to her in her gabriel appeared to mary to see him once more had been from the secret desire of this child who had hitherto had no desire being abandoned by an inconsiderate father to the guardianship own virtue she was too high minded not to deal with herself severity which noble souls never think themselves free to unless their will is fettered she therefore bravely put aside of ascanio and yet those thoughts persisted in forcing a the triple ramparts colombe had built around her heart than ascanio made his way through the wall of the grand nesle was that colombe had passed the three or four days since alternating between the fear of not seeing ascanio again alarm at the thought of being in his presence her only to dream of him as she sat at her work or walked in the garden the day she shut herself up in her own room to the despair perrine who was thereby doomed to carry on a perpetual the abyss of her own thoughts as soon as the intense heat of the gone by she would go down to the cool shady path by dame perrine the evening avenue and there sitting on where ascanio now sat she would allow the sun to set and to rise listening and replying to her thoughts until came to tell her that it was time to retire the usual hour then the young man saw colombe suddenly appear hand at the end of the path where he was sitting she was lives of the saints a dangerous romance of faith and love perhaps to prepare one for the cruel sufferings of life surely for the cold realities of the world colombe did not at first but started back in surprise when she saw a with dame perrine at that decisive moment dame perrine like general plunged boldly to the heart of the question dear colombe she said i know your kind heart so well that i didn i needed your express sanction to allow a poor wounded youth his wound in your father s cause to come and take the these trees you know there is no shade at the grand nesle surgeon won t answer for his life unless he can walk an hour she was uttering this well intentioned but barefaced falsehood suddenly spied ascanio and a vivid flush suffused her cheeks apprentice meanwhile in the presence of colombe could strength to rise to his feet it wasn t my sanction that was necessary dame perrine said at last but my father s she said these words sadly but firmly colombe reached the upon which ascanio had been sitting overheard her and said with clasped hands forgive me madame i thought i hoped that your kindness had perrine s courteous offer but if it is not so he continued in of great gentleness not unmixed with pride i beg you to involuntary boldness and i will withdraw at once but it is not for me to decide replied colombe hastily deeply moved i am not mistress here remain to day at all events even if s prohibition was meant to extend to him who saved his life monsieur if for nothing else than to receive my thanks o madame murmured ascanio it is for me to thank you and i do the bottom of my heart but by remaining shall i not interfere walk the place i have taken too is ill chosen not at all rejoined colombe mechanically without apparently so embarrassed was she to the other end of the stone bench that moment dame perrine who had not stirred since colombe reprimand growing weary of her own immobility and her s silence took dame ruperta s arm and walked softly away young people were left alone whose eyes were fixed upon her book did not at first departure of her governess and yet she was not reading for a mist before her eyes she was still excited and dizzy all was capable of doing and that she did instinctively was to agitation and repress the violent beating of her heart ascanio was beside himself he was excessively pained when he thought desired to send him away and insanely happy when he he could detect signs of emotion in his inamorata and these of emotion in his enfeebled state transported and at the same time he was like one in a swoon and yet his upon one another s heels with astounding rapidity and force she despises me she loves me he said to himself almost in the he glanced at colombe silent and still and the tears his cheeks although he felt them not meanwhile a bird was the branches overhead the leaves were scarcely stirring in breeze from the augustine church the evening angelus softly downward through the air never was july evening and peaceful it was one of nature s solemn moments when the a new sphere one of those moments which seem twenty years one remembers all his life two lovely children so well suited to each other had but to hands to join them and yet it seemed as if there were a between them a moment or two colombe raised her head you are weeping she cried obeying an impulse stronger than her will i am not weeping said ascanio falling back upon the bench but were wet with tears when he took them from his face it is true he said i am weeping why what is the matter i will call some one are you in pain only from my thoughts what thoughts pray i was thinking that perhaps it would have been better for me to die day die how old are you pray that you should talk thus of dying nineteen but the age of unhappiness is a fit age for death and what of your kindred who would weep for you said colombe eager for a glimpse into the past of this life of had a confused feeling that the future would be involved with i have no father or mother and there is no one to weep for me save benvenuto poor orphan yes an orphan indeed my father never loved me and i lost my ten years just when i was beginning to understand her love it my father but what am i saying and what are my father mother to you oh yes go on ascanio saints in heaven you remember my name go on go on whispered colombe putting her hands before her face her blushes my father was a goldsmith and my dear mother was herself the a florentine goldsmith named raphael del moro of a noble for in our italian republics to work implies no dishonor will see more than one ancient and illustrious name on the sign of my master cellini for example is as noble as the king if not even more so raphael del moro who was poor daughter stefana to marry against her will a fellow of his own age but very wealthy alas my mother and loved each other but were both fortuneless benvenuto everywhere to make a name for himself and earn money he away and could not interfere to prevent the marriage that was my father s name soon began to detest his wife did not love him although he never knew that she loved my father was a man of a violent and jealous disposition may me if i accuse him wrongfully but children have a for their wrongs very often my mother sought shelter by from his brutal treatment but he did not always respect sometimes he struck her may god forgive him while she in her arms and at every blow my mother would give me a kiss to the pain ah i remember well both the blows my mother the kisses she gave me the lord who is just dealt a blow at my father where he would feel keenly in his wealth which was dearer to him than anything the world disaster after disaster overwhelmed him he died of his money was all gone and my mother died a few days after she thought that she was no longer beloved i was left alone in the world my father s creditors laid hands that he left and in all their ferreting to make sure that they nothing they failed to discover a little weeping child maid servant who was fond of me kept me two days from charity was living on charity herself and had none too much bread for needs she was uncertain what to do with me when a man covered with the room took me in his arms embraced me weeping and the good old woman some money took me away with him it cellini who had come from rome to florence expressly to he cherished me instructed me in his art and kept me always and as i say he is the only one who would weep for my death listened with lowered eyes and oppressed heart to the orphan which in the matter of loneliness was her own and to the the poor mother s life which would perhaps be hers some day for was doomed to marry against her will a man who would hate she would not love him you are unjust to god she said to ascanio there is some one master at least who loves you and you knew your mother i my mother s kisses for she died in giving birth to me i up by my father s sister a crabbed ill tempered woman and mourned her bitterly when i lost her two years ago for in the any other affection my heart clung to her as ivy clings to a cliff two years i have been living in this place with dame perrine my loneliness and although my father comes very see me these two years have been and will be the happiest of life you have indeed suffered much said ascanio but though the past so painful why do you dread the future yours alas is full promise you are nobly born rich and beautiful and of your early years will only bring out in bolder relief of the rest of your life sadly shook her head oh mother mother she murmured rising in thought above the paltry present one loses sight of necessities of the moment in the brilliant flashes and epitomize a whole life past and future the heart affected with a dangerous vertigo and when one s memory with a thousand sorrows when one dreads bitter anguish to come same heart is often a prey to terrible emotion and fatal weakness must be very strong not to fall when the weight of destiny down upon one s heart these two children who had so much who had been always alone had but to pronounce word to make a single future for their twofold past but one dutiful the other too respectful to pronounce that word gazed at colombe however with infinite tenderness in his eyes colombe permitted his scrutiny with divine trust with and in the tone in which he might have prayed the to the maiden colombe if you have any desire which i can gratify by pouring out blood to gratify it if any disaster threatens you and nothing a life is needed to avert it say one word to me colombe as say it to your brother and i shall be very happy thanks thanks said colombe i know that you have already your life once at a word from me but god alone can save me had no time to say more for dame perrine and dame ruperta front of them at that moment gossips had made the most of their time as well as the two lovers had formed a close alliance based upon mutual sympathy had confided to dame ruperta an infallible cure for chilblains dame ruperta not to be outdone had imparted to dame perrine of preserving plums after such an exchange of confidence it to understand that they were thenceforth united for life and death they had agreed to meet frequently whatever the cost well colombe said dame perrine as they drew nigh the bench do bear me a grudge tell me wouldn t it have been a shame admission to him but for whom the house would have no master t we do our utmost to help cure this youth of a wound us look dame ruperta and see if he doesn t already look better if he hasn t more color than when he came yes indeed assented ruperta he never had more color when he was best of health consider colombe continued dame perrine it would be to interrupt convalescence so happily begun come the the means you will allow me to admit him to morrow at dusk t you it will be a pleasant change for you as well poor child very innocent one god knows when dame ruperta and i are both here my word colombe you need some sort of a change and who is tell the provost that we have softened his stern orders a bit that before he gave the order you told ascanio that he and show you his jewels he forgot them to day so he must to morrow looked at ascanio the color had fled from his cheeks and awaiting her reply in an agony of suspense the eyes of a poor girl kept a prisoner and tyrannized over a world of flattery in this humility there was then some one in whose happiness depended upon her whom she could make glad or a word every one exults in his own power the insolent airs d orbec had humiliated colombe very recently the forgive her pray could not resist the longing to see light shine in ascanio s eyes so she said with a blush and dame perrine what is this you have persuaded me to do tried to speak but could only clasp his hands effusively trembled under him thanks fair lady said ruperta with a deep courtesy come ascanio are still weak and it is time to go in give me your arm and go apprentice could hardly muster strength to say adieu and thanks he supplemented his words with a look in which his heart and meekly followed the servant his whole being joy fell back upon the bench absorbed in thought and conscious pleasurable excitement for which she reproached herself and entirely unfamiliar to her until to morrow said dame perrine triumphantly as she took her guests after escorting them to the door if you choose you can come in this way every day for three months and why for three months only asked ascanio who had dreamed always dame was dame perrine s reply because in three months colombe is comte d orbec needed all the strength of his will to keep from falling colombe to marry comte d orbec he muttered o mon dieu mon dieu deceived myself colombe does not love me dame perrine closed the door behind him at that moment and was walking in front of him neither of them overheard king s have said that benvenuto left the studio about noon without he was going he went to the louvre to return the i paid him at the cardinal of ferrara s hotel king had kept his word the name of benvenuto cellini was given the doorkeepers and ushers and all the doors flew open all the doors save one that leading to the council chamber was discussing affairs of state with the first men in and although the king s orders were explicit they dared cellini in the midst of the momentous session then in further instructions from his majesty truth france was at this time in a critical situation we have said but little of affairs of state feeling sure that our readers those of the gentler sex would prefer affairs of the politics but we have at last reached a point where we can no back and where we must needs cast a glance which we will make as possible at france and spain or rather at françois i v for in the sixteenth century kings were nations the period at which we have arrived by virtue of one of movements of the political see saw of which both so the effects françois s situation had recently improved s grown worse in equal degree in fact things had since the treaty of cambrai which was negotiated by margaret of austria aunt of charles v and the angoulême mother of françois i this treaty which was of the treaty of madrid provided that the king of cede burgundy to the king of france and that the king of renounce his claim to the homage of flanders and artois the two young princes who served as hostages for were to be sent back to him in exchange for the sum of of golden crowns lastly good queen eleanora charles v who was promised at first to the constable bourbon as a his treachery and was afterwards married to françois as a peace was to return to the court of france with the two children she had been as affectionate and devoted as any mother were carried out with equal good faith on both sides it will readily be believed that françois s renunciation of to the duchy of milan exacted from him during his captivity momentary he was no sooner a free man once more no to power and health than he turned his eyes again it was with the object of procuring countenance of his claims court of rome that he had married his son henri become dauphin death of his elder brother françois to catherine de medicis pope clement vii just at the moment when all the preparations for s meditated invasion were completed clement vii died and by alexander farnese who ascended the throne of st the name of paul iii paul iii was determined not to allow himself to be inveigled the party of the emperor or of the king of france but strictly to the policy of holding an equal balance between them his mind at ease in that direction the emperor laid aside on the subject of the preparations of france and busied out an expedition against tunis which had been seized by cher eddin so famous under the name of barbarossa who out muley hassan had taken possession of the country and sicily waste expedition was entirely successful and charles v after or four ships sailed into the bay of naples in triumph he received tidings which tended to encourage him still more iii duke of savoy although he was the maternal uncle i had followed the counsel of his new wife beatrice of emmanuel of portugal and had abandoned the party of of france so that when françois by virtue of his former charles iii called upon him to receive his troops the duke answered by refusing to do so and françois was reduced to necessity of forcing the passage of the alps which he to find open to him by favor of his ally and kinsman charles x was awakened from his feeling of security by a clap the king marched an army into savoy so promptly that found his province actually under occupation by the french he suspected that it was invaded biron who was in command army seized chambéry appeared upon the alpine passes piedmont just as francesco sforza terror stricken the news of biron s success died suddenly leaving the duchy without an heir and thereby not only making its conquest an for françois but giving him a strong claim to it as well

christ procured him the honor of entry into the capital of christendom this entry emperor to such a point that contrary to his custom he all bounds and in full consistory accused françois i basing the accusation upon the protection he accorded and upon his alliance with the turks having their former causes of disagreement wherein according to his view was always the first at fault he swore to wage a war against his brother in law disasters in the past had made françois as prudent as he reckless and so as soon as he found himself threatened at one the forces of spain and of the empire he left d annebaut to and called biron back to france with orders to devote to protecting the frontiers who were familiar with the chivalrous and enterprising françois were at a loss to understand this retrograde movement from his taking one backward step that he considered in advance this belief still further exalted the pride v he took command of his army in person and resolved france from the south results of this attempted invasion are well known marseilles held out against the connétable de bourbon and the marquis the two greatest soldiers of the time had no difficulty out against charles v a great politician but of only as a general charles was not discouraged but left and attempted to march upon avignon but montmorency an impregnable camp between the durance and the rhone

a rout and having narrowly into his enemy s hands succeeded with great difficulty barcelona where he arrived without men or money all those who were awaiting the issue of his expedition themselves declared against charles v henry viii cast off catherine of aragon in order to espouse his mistress soliman attacked the kingdom of naples and hungary princes of germany entered into a secret league against lastly the people of ghent weary of the incessant upon them to defray the expense of the war against france rose in revolt and sent ambassadors to françois to invite place himself at their head amid this universal upheaval which threatened to destroy s fortunes new negotiations were entered upon by the king and himself the two monarchs had an interview at aigues mortes françois bent upon peace which he felt to be an for france was determined thenceforth to rely upon to effect his objects and not upon an armed struggle therefore caused charles to be informed of the proposition of the ghent offering him at the same time liberty to pass through his way to flanders council had been called together to discuss this subject knocked at the door and françois true to his promise as he was advised of the great artist s presence ordered that admitted benvenuto therefore heard the end of the discussion yes messieurs françois was saying yes i agree with monsieur and it is my dream to conclude a lasting alliance with elect to raise our two thrones above all the rest and to wipe out all these corporations communes assemblies which assume to set bounds to our royal power us to day the arms to morrow the money of our subjects is to force back into the bosom of the true religion all which distress our holy mother church my dream is lastly all our forces against the enemies of christ to drive the from constantinople were it only to prove that he is not as alleged to be my ally and to establish at constantinople a rivalling the first in power in splendor and in extent that dream messieurs and i have given it that name so that i may myself to be unduly exalted by hope of success nor unduly if the future shall demonstrate as it may its impracticability if it should be fulfilled constable if it should be fulfilled were to have france and turkey paris and constantinople the the orient confess messieurs that it would be grand that be sublime i understand then sire said the duc de guise that it decided that you decline the suzerainty proffered you by and that you renounce the former domains of the house it is so decided the emperor shall see that i am an ally as loyal as a loyal foe but first of all and in any event i desire and that the duchy of milan be restored to me it belongs to me right and by imperial investiture and i will have it on as a gentleman but i trust without breaking with my and you will offer to allow charles v to pass through france on to ghent to chastise the rebels asked poyet yes monsieur le chancelier was the king s reply despatch m to day to extend the invitation in my name let us show him are disposed to go any length to maintain peace but if he majestic awe inspiring gesture accompanied this phrase an instant as françois caught sight of his artist standing the door but if he prefers war he resumed by my jupiter of whom me news i swear that it shall be war bloody desperate well benvenuto where is my jupiter sire replied cellini i bring you the model of your jupiter but know of what i was dreaming as i looked at you and listened to you was dreaming of a fountain for your fontainebleau a fountain to by a colossal statue sixty feet high holding a broken its right hand and with the left resting on its sword hilt sire should represent mars that is to say your majesty nature is all courage and you use your courage judiciously the defence of your glory stay sire that is not all at the of the base of the statue there should be four poetry painting sculpture and generosity of that i as i looked at you and listened to you sire and you shall cause your dream to live in marble or bronze benvenuto is my wish said the king in a commanding tone but with kindly smile the members of the council applauded for all deemed the king the statue and the statue worthy of the king meanwhile said the king let us see our jupiter drew the model from beneath his cloak and placed it upon around which the destiny of the world had so recently gazed at it for a moment with undisguised admiration at last he cried at last i have found a man after my own heart he continued laying his hand upon benvenuto s shoulder not which of the two experiences the greater happiness the finds an artist who thoroughly sympathizes with and understands ideas such an artist as yourself in short or the artist who prince capable of appreciating him i think that my pleasure is upon my word oh no sire permit me cried cellini surely mine is much no mine benvenuto i dare not contradict your majesty and yet let us say that we experience an equal amount of pleasure my friend you have called me your friend sire said benvenuto that is a pays me a hundred times over for all that i have done or can for your majesty very well it is my purpose to prove to you benvenuto that it was meaningless word that escaped me and that i called you my you are my friend in fact bring me my jupiter completed as possible and whatever you may ask of me when you bring it upon as a gentleman you shall have if a king s hand can procure it do you hear messieurs if i forget my promise remind me of it sire cried benvenuto you are a great and a noble king and i that i am able to do so little for you who do so much for me kissed the hand the king held out to him cellini replaced of jupiter under his cloak and left the council chamber with overflowing with pride and joy he left the louvre he met primaticcio about to go in whither go you so joyously my dear benvenuto he said as along without seeing him ah francesco is it you cried cellini yes you are quite right joyous indeed for i have just seen our great our sublime françois i and did you see madame d etampes queried primaticcio who said things to me francesco that i dare not repeat although that modesty is not my strong point but what did madame d etampes say to you he called me his friend francesco do you understand he talked to familiarly as he talks to his marshals finally he said that when is finished i may ask whatever favor i choose and it in advance but what did madame d etampes promise you what a strange man you are francesco why so you persist in talking about madame d etampes when i speak of because i know the court better than you do benvenuto because you countryman and my friend because you have brought me a breath of our dear italy and in my gratitude i desire to save you from danger mark what i say benvenuto the duchesse d etampes is your mortal enemy i have told you this before when i it i repeat it to day when i am perfectly sure of it you her and if you do not appease her benvenuto she will benvenuto mark well what i say madame d etampes is the king mon dieu what is all this cried cellini with a laugh i madame d etampes how so in god s name oh i know you benvenuto and i supposed that you knew no more than the woman herself as to the cause of her aversion to you but we do women are so constituted they hate as they love why and the duchesse d etampes hates you what would you have me do what would i have you do i would have the courtier rescue i the courtier of a courtesan you are wrong benvenuto said primaticcio smiling madame d very beautiful as every artist must admit i admit it said benvenuto very well go and say so to herself and not to me i ask nothing that to make you the best friends in the world you have by some artist s whim and it is your place to make the toward her if i wounded her said cellini i did it unintentionally or malice she said some hitter words to me which i did i put her back where she belonged and she did deserve it never mind never mind forget what she said benvenuto and make your reply i tell you again she is imperious and vindictive has the king s heart in her hand a king who loves art it is true who loves love more she will make you repent your audacity she will make enemies for you she it was who inspired with courage to resist you and listen i am just setting italy i am going to rome by her command and my journey benvenuto aimed at you i your friend am compelled to become the her spleen what are you to do at rome what am i to do there you have promised the king to emulate and i know that you are a man to keep your promise but thinks you a braggart and with a view of crushing you by no doubt she is sending me a painter to rome to make the most beautiful of the ancient statues the laocoön the venus knife grinder and god knows what that is indeed refinement of hatred said benvenuto who his good opinion of himself was not of the result of a comparison of his work with that of masters but to yield to a woman he added clenching his fists never never who spoke of yielding i will show you an excellent way to she is pleased with ascanio she wishes to employ him and me to bid him call upon her now nothing could be for you to accompany your pupil to the hôtel d etampes him yourself to the fair duchess seize the opportunity you one of those marvellous jewels which you alone can make show it to her first and when you see her eyes glisten looks at it offer it to her as an unworthy tribute to her beauty will accept will thank you gracefully and will in return make present worthy of you and take you back into favor if on hand you have that woman for an enemy abandon henceforth all things of which you are dreaming alas i too have been stoop for a moment only to rise to my full stature immediately then that dauber rosso was preferred to me he was put and always over my head they made him intendant of you are unjust to him francesco said cellini unable to conceal thought he is a great painter do you think so i am sure of it and so am i sure of it said primaticcio and that is just why i they were using him to crush me i flattered their wretched vanity now i am the great primaticcio and they are using me to crush you as i did therefore benvenuto you will never repent having advice i implore you for your own sake and mine i implore you name of your renown and your future both of which you if you persist in your obstinacy it is hard said cellini who was however perceptibly weakening determination if not for yourself benvenuto for the sake of our great king do to tear his heart by compelling him to choose between a mistress and an artist he admires very well so be it for the king s sake i will do it cried cellini to find a pretext which would spare his self esteem à la bonne heure said primaticcio you understand of course if a single word of this conversation should be repeated to it would cause my ruin oh i trust that you have no fears on that score if benvenuto gives his word all is said you have it in that case adieu brother a pleasant journey to you and good luck to you two friends having exchanged a cordial grasp of the hand parted with a gesture which summarized their whole conversation femme hôtel d etampes was not far from the hôtel de nesle our not be surprised therefore at our rapid flight from one

to his mistress to to become the wife of jacques desbrosses comte de penthièvre had given the dukedom of etampes and the government of bretagne desbrosses comte de penthièvre to induce him to marry king had spared no pains to render his gift worthy of the d heilly he had caused the old edifice to be refurbished and according to the latest style its frowning façade the delicate flowers of the renaissance life by magic like so many thoughts of love it was evident zeal displayed by the king in the decoration of this princely abode he anticipated passing almost as much of his time there as herself the apartments were furnished with royal magnificence the whole establishment was upon the footing of that of a much more extensive and luxurious indeed than that of and kindly eleanora sister of charles v and the lawful wife i who was a personage of so little importance in the world well as at the french court we are so indiscreet as to make our way into the duchess s early in the morning we shall find her half reclining upon her charming head supported by one of her lovely hands the other carelessly through her chestnut locks which a golden light her bare feet seem even smaller and whiter really are in her wide black velvet slippers and her floating négligée morning gown lends an irresistible charm to the coquette king is in the room standing by a window but he is not looking duchess he is tapping his fingers rhythmically against the glass seems to be deep in meditation he is thinking no doubt of question of charles v s journey through france pray what are you doing there sire with your back turned finally asks petulantly making verses for you my love and they are finished at last oh repeat them to me quickly i pray you my gallant crowned poet that i will the king replies with the confidence of a laurel listen étant seul et auprès d une fenêtre un matin comme le jour peignait regardais aurore à main senestre à phœbus le chemin enseignait d autre part ma mie qui

duchess clapping her hands look to your heart s content henceforth i ll not be jealous of her to her i owe such charming verses say them to me once again obligingly repeated his flattering lines for his own well as hers but this time anne said nothing what is the matter my fair siren said françois who expected compliment the matter is sire that i am considering whether i will say to even more emphatically what i said last evening a poet has pretext than a knightly king for allowing his mistress to for she is at the same time his mistress and his muse again naughty one rejoined the king with an impatient gesture indeed bon dieu your wrath is implacable in good sooth of nymphs when it leads you to neglect my verses monseigneur i hate as warmly as i love and yet suppose i were to beg you to lay aside your animosity a great fool who knows not what he says who talks just fights heedless of consequences and who had not i swear purpose to wound you you know moreover that clemency s of goddesses dear goddess mine so pray forgive the love of me simpleton indeed muttered anne oh a sublime simpleton i grant you said françois i saw and he promised to do marvellous things he is a man believe who has no rival in his art and will hereafter shed lustre on my reign as andrea del sarto titian and leonardo you know how i love my artists dearest duchess so and indulgent to him i beg you mon dieu an april shower woman s caprice and an artist s whim have more of fascination than for me come come do you whom i do love so dearly pardon at i am your servant sire and i will obey you thanks in return for this favor accorded by the woman s kindly heart may demand such gift as pleases you that lies within the prince to bestow but alas t is growing late and i must leave you council meets again to day t is an insufferable bore ah my charles makes the king s trade most irksome to me with replaces chivalry the pen the sword and t is a burning shame my soul i think we need new words to be devised for all and erudition of government adieu my poor beloved i will best to be adroit and clever you are very fortunate my dear have only to remain beautiful and heaven has made that an easy you adieu nay do not rise my page is waiting for me in au revoir and think of me as always sire waved a last farewell to her with his hand raised and went out leaving the fair duchess alone and she true promise began at once if we must say it to think of other things d etampes was of an impulsive active ambitious nature sought and gallantly won the king s love it was not long love ceased to satisfy her restless spirit and she began to ennui neither admiral biron nor the comte de longueval whom for some time nor diane de poitiers whom she always hated a sufficient amount of excitement for her needs but within the void in her heart had been measurably filled and she had live again thanks to a new hate and a new love she hated loved ascanio and she was thinking of one or the other while were completing her toilet she was fully dressed except as to her headgear the provost and the vicomte de marmagne were announced were among the most devoted partisans of the duchess in the existed at court between the dauphin s mistress diane and herself one is naturally glad to see one s friends of one s enemies and the manner of madame d etampes gracious as she gave the scowling provost and the her hand to kiss messire le prévôt she began in a tone in which unfeigned wrath with compassion that contained no suggestion of offence been informed of the infamous treatment you have received from clown you our best friend and we are extremely indignant madame replied d estourville neatly turning his misfortune into for flattery i should have been ashamed if one of my character had been spared by the villain who was not deterred beauty and charm oh said anne i think only of you as to the insult to the king who is really too indulgent to these has begged me to forget it and i have done so in that case madame the request we have to make will doubtless be received and we ask your permission to withdraw without what messire d estourville am i not at your service at all times may happen speak speak or i shall lose my temper with a friend very well madame this is what we have to say i had believed that dispose of this grant of lodgings which i owe to your favor of the vicomte de marmagne and naturally we cast our eyes hôtel de nesle which has fallen into such bad hands aha said the duchess you interest me immensely the viscount madame accepted my suggestion in the first place utmost enthusiasm but now upon reflection he hesitates with terror of the redoubtable benvenuto pardon me my good friend the viscount interposed pardon me the matter very ill i am not afraid of benvenuto but of of the king i have no fear of being killed by the italian clown use madame s words no no what i fear so to speak is that i him and that some ill may come to me for having deprived our master of a servitor by whom he seems to set great store i ventured to hope madame that in case of need your not fail him it has never yet failed my friends said the duchess and have you not on your side a better friend than i justice you not acting in accordance with the king s will his majesty marmagne replied did not himself designate the nesle as the abode of any other than benvenuto and our choice circumstances would seem very much like revenge there s it and then suppose that i kill this cellini as i can do for i shall have two sure men with me oh mon dieu exclaimed the duchess showing her white teeth as the king s protection extends to living men but i fancy takes but little thought to avenge the dead and when his art is deprived of this particular subject he will remember his affection for me i trust the man insulted me publicly marmagne do you forget it but madame rejoined the prudent viscount be very sure that all you will have to defend oh you are perfectly clear viscount nay madame if you will permit me i do not wish to leave you upon any point it may be that force will fail to effect with this devil of a man in that event we shall have stratagem if he escapes my bravos in his hôtel in broad daylight will meet him again some night by accident in a lonely street they have daggers madame as well as swords i understand said the duchess nor did she turn a shade paler to this little scheme of assassination well madame well viscount i see that you are a man of precautions and that it well to be numbered among your enemies deuce take me but touching the affair itself madame t is serious in very truth and is perhaps worth reflecting upon was i saying every one knows the king himself included that has wounded me grievously in my pride i hate him as bitterly as my husband or madame diane and i faith i think that i can what is it isabeau why do you interrupt us duchess s last words were addressed to one of her women who in a state of intense excitement mon dieu madame said she i ask madame s pardon but the benvenuto cellini is below with the loveliest little you can imagine he said very courteously that he has come it to your ladyship and he requests the favor of speaking a moment aha exclaimed the duchess with an expression of gratified pride what reply did you make to him isabeau that madame was not dressed and that i would go and inform her of very good it would seem the duchess added turning to the that our enemy sees the error of his ways and begins who we are and what we can do all the same he will not so cheaply as he thinks and i don t propose to accept his in a moment he must be made to feel the enormity of his offence weight of our indignation a little more sensibly say to him that you have informed me and that i bid him wait went out i was saying vicomte de marmagne resumed the duchess with softening in her tone that what you were speaking of is serious matter and that i could hardly promise to give to what is after all nothing less than ambuscade but the insult was so pronounced the provost ventured to say the reparation will be no less so i trust messire this famous pride has resisted the will of sovereigns is yonder in my the good pleasure of a woman and two hours of this in all conscience sufficiently atone for an impertinent word not be altogether pitiless provost forgive him as i him two hours hence ought my influence over you to be less king s over me kindly permit us to take leave now madame said the provost bowing for i prefer not to make a promise to my real sovereign which i keep take your leave oh no said the duchess who was determined to of her triumph i intend messire le prévôt that you present at the humiliation of your enemy and thus we shall both by the same stroke i devote the next two hours to you and nay do not thank me they say that you are marrying to comte d orbec i believe a beautiful parti in sooth i should have said not beautiful 6 pray sit you down messire you know that my consent is needful for this marriage and you ve it yet but i will give it you d orbec is as devoted to me i hope that we are at last to see your lovely child and for our own and that her husband will not be so ill advised as bring her to court what is her name messire colombe madame a sweet pretty name t is said that one s name has an influence s destiny if it be so the poor child should have a tender heart be foredoomed to suffer well isabeau what is it now nothing madame he said that he would wait ah yes t is well i had forgotten him already yes yes messire again keep your eye on colombe the count s a husband of the as mine as ambitious as the duc d etampes is avaricious and of exchanging his wife for some duchy and then you must of me as well especially if she s as pretty as she s said to be will present her to me will you not messire t will be no fair so that i may be prepared to defend myself duchess exultant in anticipation of her triumph ran on thus for while with apparent unconcern although her impatient joy could in her every movement well well she said at last another half hour and the two have passed then we will release poor benvenuto from his agony yourselves in his place he must suffer terribly for he is to this sort of sentry go to him the louvre is always open king always visible in truth i pity him although he well he must be gnashing his teeth must be not and then to be unable vent to his anger ha ha ha i shall have many a hearty this but what is that i hear bon dieu all that shouting may it not be that the soul of the damned is wearying of purgatory the provost with renewed hope i propose to go and see said the duchess turning pale come my masters come persuaded by the arguments we have heard to make his the all powerful favorite on the day following his primaticcio took the little golden vase as a peace offering to the hôtel d etampes with ascanio leaning on his arm weak and very pale after a night of suffering in the first place footmen refused to announce him at so early an hour and he lost half hour parleying with them he had already begun to lose when isabeau at last made her appearance and consented him to her mistress she returned to say to benvenuto that was dressing and he must wait a short time he took patience and sat himself down upon a stool beside ascanio who overdone by the walk in conjunction with his fever painful thoughts hour passed benvenuto began to count the minutes after all the toilette of a duchess is the most important function day and i don t propose to lose the benefit of the step i for a quarter of an hour more or less in the face of this philosophical reflection he began the seconds ascanio turned paler and paler he was determined to to his master of his sufferings and had accompanied him word but he had eaten nothing that morning and although he acknowledge it he felt that his strength was failing him could not remain seated but began to stalk up and down quarter of an hour passed are you suffering my child he asked no master indeed i m not you are the one who is suffering i beg you for she cannot be long now that moment isabeau appeared again your mistress is very slow said benvenuto mischievous girl went to the window and looked at the clock in why you have waited only an hour and a half she said why do pray cellini frowned she laughed in his face and tripped away by a violent effort subdued his wrath once more but to do it he was obliged to resume his seat and sat with silent and stem he seemed calm but his wrath was two servants stood like statues at the door observing a serious expression which seemed to him derisory clock struck the quarter benvenuto glanced at ascanio and saw was paler than ever and almost ready to faint ah ça he cried throwing his self restraint to the winds so done designedly i chose to believe what i was told and naturedly but if an insult is intended and i am so little them that the thought did not occur to me if an insult is intended am not the man to allow myself to be insulted even by a woman and come ascanio he spoke benvenuto raising in his powerful hand the on which the duchess in her wrath had humiliated him for hours without his knowledge let it fall to the floor it the valets made a movement toward him but he half dagger and they stopped ascanio terrified for his master rise but his excitement had exhausted what remained of his strength he fell to the floor unconscious benvenuto at first did not that moment the duchess appeared in the doorway pale and wrath yes i go benvenuto repeated in a voice of thunder perfectly of her presence but addressing the valets do you tell the i take my present with me to give to somebody i know not whom who more worthy of it than herself tell her that if she took me of her valets like yourselves she made a sad mistake and that do not sell our loyalty and homage as she sells her love make way for me follow me ascanio he spoke he turned toward his beloved pupil and saw that his closed and that his head had fallen back against the wall ascanio he cried ascanio my child fainting perhaps dying my beloved and t is this woman again and benvenuto a threatening gesture to madame d etampes at the same to carry ascanio away in his arms duchess meanwhile transfixed with rage and terror had not moved but when she saw ascanio with his head thrown back and his dishevelled as white as marble and so beautiful in his pallor rushed to him in obedience to an irresistible impulse and fell knees opposite benvenuto seizing one of ascanio s hands in her own why the child is dying if you take him away monsieur you will he may need immediate attention jerome run and fetch i do not mean that he shall go from here in this condition understand you may go or stay as you please but leave him cast a penetrating glance at the duchess and one of at ascanio he realized that there could be no danger in cherished pupil in the care of madame d etampes while there very serious danger in removing him without proper precaution was soon made up as always for swift and inexorable decision of cellini s most striking good or had qualities you will answer for him madame he said oh with my life cried the duchess softly kissed his apprentice on the forehead and wrapping his him stalked proudly from the room with his hand upon his dagger without exchanging a glance of hatred and disdain with the duchess for the two men he did not deign to look at them followed her enemy so long as she could see him with eyes wrath then with an entire change of expression her eyes and anxiously upon the comely invalid love took the place the tigress became a gazelle once more master andré she said to her physician who entered hurriedly he is wounded and dying it is nothing said master andré a mere passing weakness poured upon ascanio s lips a few drops of a cordial which he about him he is coming to himself cried the duchess he moved now master be kept quiet must he not take him into yonder room she said valets and lay him upon a couch but hark ye she added her voice so that none but they could hear if one you as to what you have seen and heard your neck shall pay tongue go trembling lackeys bowed and gently lifting ascanio bore him away alone with the provost and the vicomte de marmagne passive spectators of the outrage upon her madame d etampes both especially the latter with a scornful glance but repressed the inclination to express her contempt in words i was saying viscount she began in a bitter tone but calmly i that the thing you proposed was very serious but i did sufficiently upon it i have sufficient power i think me to strike down a traitor even as i should have sufficient were to deal with indiscreet friends the king would condescend him this time i trust but i choose to avenge myself make the insult public vengeance will bury it you have been clever enough messieurs to postpone my vengeance in order not its success and i congratulate you upon it be shrewd i conjure you not to let it escape you and do not compel me recourse to others than yourselves vicomte de marmagne it to speak plainly to you i guarantee you equal impunity executioner but if you care for my advice i advise you and to lay aside the sword and trust to the dagger say nothing and that promptly that is the most satisfactory response adieu these words uttered in a short abrupt tone the duchess hand as if to point out the door to the two noblemen they too confused to find words in which to frame an excuse the room oh to think that i am only a woman and am obliged to resort to exclaimed anne looking after them while her lips oh how i despise them all royal lover venal husband in silken doublet valet in livery all save a single one whom own despite i admire and another whom i delight to love entered the room to which the interesting invalid had been carried she approached the couch ascanio opened his eyes it was nothing said master andré to the duchess the young man a wound in the shoulder and fatigue some mental shock it may be caused a momentary faintness from which he recovered as you see by the use of cordials he is now and may safely be taken home in a litter very good said the duchess handing a purse to master andré low and went out where am i said ascanio seeking to collect his thoughts you are with me at my home ascanio the duchess replied at your home madame ah yes i recognize you you are etampes and i remember too where is benvenuto where is my master do not stir ascanio your master is safe never fear he is at home at the present moment but how does it happen that he left me here you lost consciousness and he trusted you to my care and you assure me madame that he is in no danger that he went unharmed i tell you again i promise you ascanio that he has never been to danger than at this moment ungrateful boy when i etampes am watching over him and caring for him with the of a sister to persist in speaking of his master o madame i pray you pardon me and accept my thanks said ascanio indeed it s high time rejoined the duchess shaking her pretty a sly smile she began to speak giving to every word a tender intonation to the simplest phrases the subtlest of meanings asking greedily and at the same time with respect and listening reply as if her destiny depended upon it she was humble soft as a cat quick to grasp every cue like a consummate actress ascanio gently back to the subject if he wandered from it him all the credit for ideas which she evolved and cunningly to seeming to distrust herself and listening to him as if he oracle exerting to the utmost the cultivated charming as we have said caused her to be called the loveliest stockings and the most learned of beauties in short became in her hands the most cajoling flattery and of seductions as the youth for the third or fourth time to take his leave she said still detaining him you speak ascanio with so much eloquence and fire of your goldsmith that it is a perfect revelation to me and henceforth i shall conception of a master where i have hitherto seen only an ornament your opinion benvenuto is the great master of the art madame he has surpassed the divine michel angelo himself i am pleased to hear it you lessen the ill will i bear him on his rude behavior to me oh you must not mind his roughness madame his brusque a most ardent and devoted heart but benvenuto is at the the most impatient and fiery of men he thought that you him wait in mere sport and the insult say the mischief rejoined the duchess with the simulated confusion spoiled child it is the truth that i was not dressed when arrived and i simply prolonged my toilet a little it was wrong wrong you see that i confess my sins to you freely i knew you were with him she added eagerly true madame but cellini who is not very sagacious i admit confidence has been sadly abused deems you to be i may say it who are so gracious and kind very wicked and very terrible and that he detected an insult in what was nothing more than child do you think so queried the duchess unable wholly to repress smile oh forgive him madame he is noble hearted and generous and if you as you are believe me he would ask your pardon for his his knees say no more i pray you do you think to make me love him now i a grudge i tell you and to begin with i propose to raise up that will be difficult madame no ascanio for you his pupil shall be the rival allow me if i must do homage to this great genius who detests me to do say will

need your help but to day it is in no one s power to help me who knows i know madame ah me ascanio you are unhappy you are unhappy you cannot sadly shook his head you are disingenuous with a friend ascanio t is not well done the duchess continued taking the young man s hand and it my master must be anxious madame and i am afraid that my you i feel quite well again allow me to withdraw how eager you are to leave me wait at least until a litter is you do not resist it is the doctor s order and my own called a servant and gave him the necessary orders then bring her pearls and some of her

not love me and there is nothing left for me to do but adieu madame and pity me hurriedly kissed madame d etampes s hand as she stood mute and vanished a rival a rival said anne as if awaking from a dream but she love him and he shall love me for i will have it so oh yes that he shall love me and that i will kill benvenuto footnote 5 alone beside my window morning as the day was breaking saw at my left hand phœbus pointing out his daily road on the other hand my sweetheart golden locks i saw her beaming shone so lovingly upon me i was fain to cry aloud immortal gods return to your abodes celestial loveliness doth put yours to the blush footnote 6 je dis beau c est bon que je devrais dire it is proven that sorrow is of the life of ask pardon for the bitter misanthropy of this title it is the the present chapter will exhibit scarcely any other than sorrow and therein will resemble life the reflection new as a celebrated character in comic opera would say but it in that it will perhaps he accepted as an apology by whom we are about to lead even as virgil led dante to despair offence is intended either to the reader or to virgil friends in very truth at the moment at which we have now arrived all beginning with benvenuto and ending with jacques aubry in melancholy and we are about to see them gradually the dark rising tide of sorrow left benvenuto exceedingly anxious concerning ascanio s condition return to the grand nesle he thought but little of the wrath d etampes i promise you his sole preoccupation was his so it was that his joy knew no hounds when the door opened admission to a litter and ascanio leaping lightly to the ground his hand and assured him that he was no worse than in but benvenuto s brow quickly grew dark at the apprentice words and he listened with an expression of while the younger man said master i propose to show you that you have done a wrong for which make amends and i am sure that you will thank me instead me ill will for it you are mistaken with relation to etampes she neither despises nor hates you on the contrary and admires you and you must agree that you were very rude treatment of her a woman and a duchess master madame d not only as beautiful as a goddess she is as kind as an angel and enthusiastic simple minded and noble and at heart is lovely what you deemed insulting insolence this nothing more than childish mischief i implore you for your you surely would not be unjust as well as for mine whom she and cared for with such touching kindness not to persist insulting contempt for her i will answer for it that you will difficulty in persuading her but you do not answer me dear master shake your head can it be that i have wounded you hark ye my child rejoined benvenuto gravely i have often told in my view there is but one thing in the world forever beautiful young forever fruitful and that is art divine and yet i hope i know that in certain tender hearts love also much a deep and noble sentiment which may make happy a but it is very rare for what is love in most cases a fancy of a joyous intimacy in which both parties are deceived and in the best of faith i make sport of this love as it is called with great freedom as you know i laugh at its high and its stilted language i do not slander it to say truth rather pleases me it has in petto all the joy all the sweetness the jealousy of a serious passion but its wounds are not mortal or tragedy after a certain time one hardly remembers it save sort of theatrical performance and then ascanio while women creatures to my mind all save a very few do not deserve and understand anything more than this passing fancy to give them more must be a dupe or an imprudent fool take scozzone for example should enter my heart she would be terrified at what she i leave her at the threshold and she sings and dances she of heart and happy moreover ascanio these ever have a less durable basis which however is all sufficient artist the worship of form and the adoration of pure beauty their serious side and it is on account of that i say no ill although i laugh at them but ascanio mark this there are which do not make me laugh but make me tremble terrible passions as impossible as things we see in dreams mon dieu thought ascanio can he have learned aught of my for colombe they afford neither pleasure nor happiness continued cellini they take possession of one s whole being they are vampires drink your whole existence which devour your heart little they hold you in a deathly embrace and you cannot ascanio ascanio beware of such a passion t is clear are mere chimeras and that they can in no way profit one and who know this well plunge into them body and soul and abandon to them almost with joy he has that in his mind he knows all said ascanio to himself my dear son pursued benvenuto if there still is time break which would hold you fast forever you will bear the mark of them try at least to save your life who told you that i love her in god s name demanded the apprentice if you do not love her god be praised exclaimed benvenuto ascanio denied the impeachment when he simply asked a question beware at all events for i saw this morning that she loves you this morning of whom are you speaking what do you mean of whom am i speaking of madame d etampes madame d etampes echoed the bewildered apprentice why master wrong it s not possible you say that you saw that madame d me ascanio i am forty years old i have lived and i know whereof by her manner of looking at you by the favorable opinion has succeeded in leading you to form of her i would dare swear loves you and from the enthusiasm with which you defended her i was much afraid that you had fallen in love with her as well case dear ascanio you would be lost her love hot enough your whole being when it left you would leave you with no faith no hope and you would have no other resource but others as you had been loved yourself and to carry to other havoc that had been wrought in your own master said ascanio i do not know whether ha dame d etampes but i am perfectly sure that i do not love madame d etampes was no more than half convinced by ascanio s for he thought that he might be deceived as to his he said nothing more on the subject and in the days often gazed at the apprentice with a sad face should be said however that he did not seem to be on ascanio s account he gave every indication of by some personal distress he lost his frank joyous manner no longer indulged in his original pranks of former days he himself during the forenoon in his room over the foundry given explicit orders that he should not be disturbed there of the day he worked at the gigantic statue of mars with ardor but without talking about it with his especially in ascanio s presence did he seem gloomy and almost shamefaced he seemed to avoid his dear pupil he were his creditor or his judge in short it was easy to see great sorrow or some great passion had found its way into heart and was laying it waste was hardly more happy he was persuaded as he had said d etampes that colombe did not love him comte d orbec whom only by name was in his jealous thoughts a young and and messire d estourville s daughter the happy betrothed of favored nobly born lover had never for an instant thought of artist even if he had retained the vague and fleeting never deserts a heart overflowing with love he had his last chance if madame d etampes was really in love by disclosing to her the name of her rival this proposed marriage she might perhaps have prevented she would now do everything power to hasten forward and poor colombe would feel the full her hatred yes benvenuto was right that woman s love was in a terrible and deadly thing but colombe s love would surely sublime celestial sentiment of which the master had first spoken alas that immeasurable blessing was destined for another was in despair he had believed in madame d etampes and now it seemed that this deceitful friendship was passion he had hoped for colombe s love and it seemed supposititious passion was nothing more than indifferent friendship felt that he almost hated both these women who had so falsified in that each of them regarded him as he would have liked to by the other absorbed by a feeling of hopeless discouragement he did think of the lily ordered by madame d etampes and in his he would not repeat his visit to the petit nesle despite and reproaches of ruperta whose innumerable questions unanswered sometimes however he repented of the resolution on the first day which was assuredly cruel to none but himself to see colombe to demand an explanation but of what of his visions however he would see her he would think in moments he would confess his love to her as a crime and she tender hearted that perhaps she would comfort him as if it were but how explain his absence how excuse himself in s eyes allowed the days to pass in innocent sorrowful reflections not dare to take any decided step awaited ascanio s coming with mingled terror and joy on the that on which dame perrine floored the apprentice with revelation but in vain did she count the hours and the minutes vain did dame perrine keep her ears on the alert ascanio who in good time from his swoon and might have availed himself s gracious permission did not come attended by ruperta the preconcerted signal at the door in the wall of the petit nesle did it mean meant that ascanio was ill dying perhaps at all events too ill at least that was what colombe thought she passed the kneeling at her prie dieu weeping and praying and when to pray she found that she continued to weep that her the anxiety which oppressed her heart was a revelation indeed there was sufficient cause for alarm for in less than ascanio had taken possession of her thoughts to such a degree make her forget her god her father and her misery there was room in her mind for nothing now but this ascanio within two steps of her he would die before she could it was no time to reason but to weep and weep if he should she would reflect next day it was still worse perrine watched for ruperta and as she saw her leave the house rushed out to go to market for more than for supplies now ascanio was no longer seriously ill simply refused to go to the petit nesle without replying to s eager questions otherwise than by obstinately keeping silent two gossips were reduced to conjectures such a thing was to them however did not seek long for the explanation she said at once he knows all he has learned that in three months i shall be orbec s wife and he has no wish to see me again first impulse was to be grateful to her lover for his anger and let him explain this secret joy who can we are simply but soon upon reflection she took it ill of ascanio that able to believe that she was not in despair at the thought of union so he despises me she said to herself these impulses indignant or affectionate were very dangerous bare the heart which before knew not itself colombe said aloud that she did not desire to see ascanio but that she awaited his coming to justify herself she her timorous conscience she suffered in her misapprehended love was not the only passion which ascanio did not understand there more powerful more impatient to make itself known and darkly of happiness as hatred dreams of vengeance d etampes did not believe did not choose to believe s profound passion for colombe a child who has no conception of what he really wants she said who falls in love with the first pretty girl he sees who in collision with the high and mighty airs of an empty fool and whose pride takes offence at the least obstacle oh he realizes what true love is ardent clinging love when he i duchesse d etampes whose caprice rules a kingdom ah but he must know it vicomte de marmagne and the provost of paris suffered in as anne and colombe suffered in their love they harbored to benvenuto marmagne especially benvenuto had caused him despised and humiliated by a woman benvenuto constrained him to for before the scene at the hôtel d etampes the viscount had him poniarded by his people on the street but now he go and beard him in his own house and marmagne shuddered at the prospect we do not readily pardon those who force us that we are cowards all were suffering even scozzone scozzone the madcap laughed no more and her eyes were often red with weeping benvenuto love her benvenuto was always cold and sometimes spoke sharply had for a long time had a fixed idea which had become with her she was determined to become benvenuto s wife first went to him expecting to serve him as a plaything and her with all the consideration due a wife and not as a o love the poor child was greatly exalted by such unlocked and honor and at the same time she felt profoundly grateful benefactor and unaffectedly proud to find herself so afterward not at benvenuto s command but in response to she gladly consented to serve him as model and by dint her own form and features so often reproduced and so in bronze in silver and in gold she had simply of the goldsmith s success to herself for the lovely outlines were so loudly praised belonged to her much more than to she blushed with pleasure when benvenuto was complimented purity of the lines of this or that figure she herself that she was indispensable to her lover s renown become a part of his glory even as she had become a part of child she did not dream that she had never been to the artist inspiration that hidden divinity which every creator evokes which makes him a creator because benvenuto copied her she believed in good faith that he owed everything to her little by little she took courage to hope that after raising to the rank of mistress he would raise the mistress to of wife dissimulation was altogether foreign to her character she had ambition in very precise terms cellini listened to her gravely this requires consideration fact was that he would have preferred to return to the castle of at the risk of breaking his leg a second time in making not that he despised his dear scozzone he loved her dearly a little jealously as we have seen but he adored art and his true and lawful wife was sculpture first of all when he should be married would not the husband spirits of the gay bohemian would not the pater familias with the freedom of the sculptor and again if he must his models he would commit bigamy a hundred times over when i cease to love scozzone and to need her as a model he said i will find some worthy fellow for her too short sighted back into the past and to divine the future who will see a lovely woman and the marriage portion i will give her thus i her mania for wearing the name of wife bourgeois fashion was convinced that scozzone s desire was simply to have and that it mattered little to her who the husband might be he left the ambitious damsel to take what comfort she her fancies but since their installation at the grand nesle had been opened and she realized that she was not so necessary s life and work as she thought for she could no longer with dispel the cloud of melancholy which overhung his brow and begun to model a hebe in wax for which she was not asked to pose the poor child horribile dictu had essayed to play with ascanio in cellini s presence and there had been not drawing together of the eyebrows to bear witness to s jealous wrath must she then bid farewell to all her and become once more a poor humiliated creature to pagolo if any one cares to sound the depths of his heart to say that he had never been more gloomy and taciturn than may be imagined that the hilarious student jacques aubry this contagious depression of spirits not at all he had cause for rejoining simonne after waiting a long while for him sunday of the siege of nesle returned to the conjugal mansion in and had since stubbornly refused to meet the impertinent upon any pretext whatsoever he in revenge had withdrawn from his capricious charmer s husband but that evinced at the news no other sentiment than the for although jacques aubry wore out his clothes recklessly always excepting the pockets we must add that economical maxim was never to pay for them when simonne was no longer exerted as a counterpoise to the absence the selfish tailor concluded that the honor of dressing did not compensate him for the loss he suffered by dressing nothing our poor friend found himself at one and the same time bereft love and cut short in his supply of clothing luckily as we he was not the man to wither away in melancholy he soon fell a charming little consolation named gervaise but gervaise all over with principles of all sorts which to his mind absurd she eluded him again and again and he wore his heart devising means to bring the flirt to her senses he almost lost to eat and drink especially as his infamous landlord who was to his infamous tailor refused to give him credit all whose names have figured prominently in these pages were at ease from the king who was very anxious to know v would or would not conclude to pass through france to and dame ruperta who were much put out at their inability their gossip if our readers like jupiter of old had privilege of listening to all the complaints and all of mankind they would hear a plaintive chorus something aubry if gervaise would only cease to laugh in my face if benvenuto would only have one pang of jealousy if scozzone could only bring herself to detest the master if i might have the good fortune to surprise cellini alone d etampes if ascanio only knew how i love him if i could see him for one moment long enough to if she would only explain if i dared confess my agony to ascanio alas alas alas it appears that joy is nothing sorrow in another these longings were to be gratified before the end of the week gratification was destined to leave those who had formed them and more melancholy than ever such is the universal law contains the germ of sorrow the first place gervaise ceased to laugh in jacques aubry s face most ardently desired by the student as the reader jacques aubry had discovered the golden fetters which were the damsel to his chariot they consisted in a lovely ring benvenuto himself and representing two clasped hands should be said that since the day of the siege jacques aubry a warm friendship for the outspoken and energetic nature florentine artist he did not interrupt him when he an unheard of thing he kept his eyes fixed upon him to him with respect which was more than he had ever do for his professors he admired his work with an enthusiasm which not very enlightened was at least very warm and sincere on hand his loyalty his courage and his jovial cellini he was just strong enough at tennis to make a but to lose in the end he was his match at table within in short he and the goldsmith had become the best friends in and cellini generous because his wealth was inexhaustible day forced him to accept this little ring which was carved marvellous skill that in default of the apple it would eve and sown discord between peleus and thetis the morrow of the day when the ring passed from jacques aubry s those of gervaise gervaise resumed a serious demeanor and hoped that she was his poor fool on the contrary he was hers succeeded as she desired in kindling a spark of jealousy s heart this is how it came about evening when her wiles and coquetries had as usual failed to master from his imperturbable gravity she assumed a herself benvenuto said she it seems to me do you know as if you your promise to me what promise is that my dear child rejoined benvenuto an explanation of her reproach from the ceiling haven t you promised a hundred times to marry me i don t remember it you don t remember it no i should say that my only reply was this well have you considered it yes with what result that i am still too young to be anything else than your lover we will speak of it again later and i am no longer foolish enough monsieur to be content with a promise as that and to wait for you forever do as you please little one and if you are in so great a hurry but what prejudice have you against marriage after all why need any change in your life you will have made a poor girl who happy that s all what change will it make in my life scozzone said benvenuto gravely you see yonder candle whose pale flame but feebly lights this where we are i place an extinguisher over it and now it is marriage would do the same to my life light the candle again i detest the darkness i understand cried scozzone volubly bursting into tears you illustrious a name to give to a poor girl a nobody who has her heart and her life all that she had to give and is ready everything for you who lives only in your life who loves i know it scozzone and i assure you that i am as grateful who has gladly done her best to enliven your solitude who jealous disposition never looks at the cavalcades of and sergeants who has always closed her ears to the soft she has not failed to hear nevertheless even here even here rejoined benvenuto yes here even here do you understand scozzone cried benvenuto it s not one of my comrades i trust dared so to insult his master he would marry me if i would let him continued scozzone s wrath to a rejuvenescence of his love for her scozzone tell me the insolent varlet s name it s not ascanio there is a man who has said to me more than a hundred times catherine the master abuses you he will never marry you sweet as you are he is too proud for that oh if he loved you as you or if you would love me as you love him give me his name the traitor s name cried benvenuto but i simply would not listen to him continued scozzone enchanted success of her stratagem on the contrary all his soft words and i threatened to tell you all if he kept on i loved i was blind and the gallant got nothing by his fine speeches languishing looks oh put on your indifferent air and pretend believe me it is all true none the less i do not believe you scozzone said benvenuto who saw that if to know his rival s name he must employ a very different any he had hitherto attempted what you don t believe me no you think that i am lying i think that you are mistaken in your opinion then it s not possible for any one to love me i don t say that but you think it smiled for he saw that he had found a way to make but there is some one who loves me and that s the truth made another gesture indicating incredulity he loves me more than you ever loved me more than you ever will monsieur do you understand began to laugh heartily i am very curious to know who this gallant médor is he said his name is not médor retorted catherine what then madis nor amadis his name is galaor his name is pagolo if you must know aha so it s monsieur pagolo muttered cellini yes it s monsieur pagolo rejoined scozzone wounded by tone in which cellini uttered his rival s name a boy family sedate quiet devout and who would make a most is that your opinion scozzone yes it is my opinion and yet you have never given him any hope i have never listened to him oh i was a great fool but after this you are right scozzone you should listen to him and reply to him how so what s that you say i bid you listen when he speaks to you of love and not turn him away will attend to the rest but but never fear i have my plan à la bonne heure but i hope you don t propose to punish him poor devil he acts as if he were confessing his sins when i love you play him a trick if you choose but not with i ask mercy for him you will be content with my vengeance scozzone for it will turn advantage in what way it will help to gratify one of your fondest desires what do you mean benvenuto that is my secret oh if you knew what an absurd figure he cuts when he tries to said the volatile creature incapable of remaining sad in succession and so naughty man you are still interested whether any one is paying court to your giddy girl you do poor scozzone a little yes but do not fail to follow the instructions i give you in regard to the letter oh don t be afraid i can play a part as well as another it won t before he will say to me catherine are you still cruel and reply what again monsieur pagolo but in a not very you understand encouraging rather when he sees that i am harsh he will think he s conquered the world but what shall to him benvenuto when shall you begin to take your revenge will it be long drawn out and very amusing shall we laugh yes we shall laugh benvenuto replied and you will always love me imprinted an assenting kiss upon her forehead the best answers since it answers for everything without answering scozzone did not suspect that cellini s kiss was the beginning vengeance vicomte de marmagne s wish that he might find benvenuto alone gratified this is how it came about on by the provost s anger goaded by the memory of etampes s disdain and influenced above all by his inordinate avarice viscount having resolved to attack the lion in his den with the his two sbirri selected for his enterprise saint eloy s day studio was likely to be deserted as it was a holiday in s guild he was proceeding along the quay with his head high his heart beating fast his two bravos walking ten steps behind him well well said a voice at his side here s a fine young amorous conquest bent with his valorous bearing for the lady two sbirri for the husband turned thinking that some one of his friends was speaking but he saw only a stranger who was going in the same direction but whom in his absorption he had failed to observe i ll wager that i have guessed the truth my fair sir continued i will bet my purse against yours without knowing what that you are out on some such errand oh tell me nothing s one s duty to be circumspect in love my own name is jacques aubry profession student and i am on my way at present to an my sweetheart gervaise philipot a pretty girl but of appalling virtue which suffered shipwreck however certain ring to be sure the ring was a jewel and a jewel workmanship nothing less than one of benvenuto cellini then the vicomte de marmagne had hardly listened to of his loquacious interlocutor and had been careful not but his interest was aroused by the name of benvenuto cellini one of benvenuto cellini s carvings the devil that s a royal gift student to make oh pray understand my dear baron are you baron count or viscount viscount said marmagne biting his lips at the with which the student assumed to address him but find out if he could not procure some valuable information from him pray understand my dear viscount that i did not buy it no m an artist in my way i don t put my money into such trifles himself gave it to me in acknowledgment of my lending him last sunday to take the grand nesle from the provost then you are cellini s friend marmagne inquired his most intimate friend viscount and i glory in it it s a friendship for life and death doubtless you also yes you are very fortunate a sublime genius is he not my dear fellow me i say my dear fellow but it s simply my way of speaking i think that i am nobly born too at least my mother used my father so whenever he beat her however i am as i told you admirer the confidant the brother of the great benvenuto cellini consequently a friend to his friends and a foe to his foes for goldsmith doesn t lack foes in the first place etampes secondly the provost of paris the old villain and thirdly certain vicomte de marmagne a great lanky creature whom you and who proposes so they say to take possession of nesle pardieu he ll have a warm reception benvenuto has heard of his claim has he queried marmagne take a very decided interest in the student s conversation he has been warned but hold i must not tell you so that marmagne may receive the chastisement he deserves from what you say i judge that benvenuto is on his guard on his guard why benvenuto is always on his guard he has come ace of being assassinated i don t know how many times but he has always come safely out of it what do you mean by on his guard oh i don t mean that he has a garrison as that old poltroon of had no no quite the contrary indeed he is entirely alone moment as all the fellows have gone to vanvres for a holiday i go myself and play a game of tennis with him dear benvenuto gervaise s convenience conflicted with the great artist s as you will agree i gave the preference to gervaise in that case i will take your place with benvenuto said marmagne do so it will be a meritorious action on your part go my and say to benvenuto from me that he will see me this evening knocks rather loud is the signal you know he adopted on account of that great oaf of a marmagne who is likely imagines to try to play him some scurvy trick do you know de marmagne no ah so much the worse you might have described him to me what for so that i might suggest a little game with clubs to him if i in with him i don t know why it is but although i never saw him you know i particularly detest your marmagne my dear fellow and ever falls in my way i propose to pummel him in fine shape me here we are at the augustins and i am compelled to by the way what is your name my friend viscount walked away as if he did not hear the question aha said jacques aubry it seems that we prefer to remain incog s the purest chivalry or i don t know myself as you please viscount as you please jacques aubry thrust his hands in his pockets and strutted down battoir at the end of which gervaise lived whistling a student vicomte de marmagne continued his journey toward the grand nesle was in fact alone as jacques aubry had said ascanio away i know not where to dream catherine had gone to visit one of her friends and all the workmen and holiday making at vanvres master was in the garden working at the clay model of his of mars whose colossal head could see the louvre over the roof the grand nesle when little jehan who was on guard at the door day deceived by marmagne s manner of knocking took him for and admitted him with his two sbirri benvenuto did not like titian work with his coat of mail upon he did like salvator rosa work with his sword at his side carbine within reach of his hand marmagne therefore that life had gained very little by surprising him he surprised an armed man viscount did not even try to dissemble his bravado born and when cellini in an imperative tone which called for reply demanded why he had come upon his premises i have no business with you was his answer i am the vicomte i am the king s secretary and here is an order from he added holding a paper above his head which allots of the grand nesle to me i am here to make provision to my taste that portion of the hotel which is allotted to me which i shall occupy henceforth that marmagne still followed by his two sbirri stalked door of the château seized his carbine which was as we have said within and with one bound stood in front of the door on the stoop halt where you are he cried in a terrible voice stretching out arm in marmagne s direction one step more and you re a viscount at once stopped short although after these might perhaps have anticipated a desperate conflict there are men to whom is given the power to strike terror to s hearts there is an indescribable something in their look their attitude as in the look the gestures and the the lion the air about them is instinct with awe their power afar off when they stamp upon the ground clench their fists brows or inflate their nostrils the boldest hesitate to a wild beast whose young are attacked has but to bristle up noisily to make the assailant tremble the men of whom we living dangers valiant hearts recognize their like in them and forward to meet them despite their secret emotion but the timid the cowardly recoil at sight of them marmagne as the reader has discovered was not a valiant heart had all the appearance of a living danger so when the viscount heard the redoubtable goldsmith s voice the imperial gesture of the arm extended toward him that death for himself and his two sbirri lay dormant in the sword and the dagger with which he was armed little jehan seeing that his master was threatened himself with a pike felt that his game was up and that he would be only if he could extricate himself safe and sound from the wasps he had stumbled upon it s all right it s all right messire goldsmith he said all wanted was to know whether you were or were not disposed to obey s orders you scoff at them and refuse to abide by them we shall apply to some one who will find a way to compel but do not hope that we shall do ourselves the honor with you bonsoir bonsoir said benvenuto with his hearty laugh jehan show out viscount and his two sbirri shamefacedly retreated from nesle cowed by one man and shown out by a mere boy was the lamentable result of the fulfilment of the viscount s wish if only i could find benvenuto alone he had been even more cruelly treated by fate in the matter of than jacques aubry and scozzone who did not even yet detect of destiny our valorous viscount was furious madame d etampes was right he said to himself and i am fain the advice she gave me i must break my sword and sharpen this devil of a man is just what he is said to be and not at all agreeable i saw it written plainly enough eyes that if i took another step i was a dead man but in cause there is a possibility of revenge look well to yourself benvenuto look well to yourself proceeded to lay the blame upon his companions who were tried men and would have asked nothing better than to earn their by slaying or being themselves slain in retiring they obeyed their master s orders they promised to give a of themselves in an ambuscade but as marmagne to shield honor claimed that the check he had met with was due to them them that he did not propose to accompany them in their and that they must go through with it alone as best it was the very thing they most desired enjoined silence upon them concerning their recent experience upon the provost of paris and informed him that he had the surest way to avoid all suspicion was to postpone benvenuto until some day when as frequently happened he ventured lonely deserted street with a considerable sum of money or piece of his handiwork then it would be believed that he murdered by robbers now remains for us to see how the wishes of madame d etampes and cellini were gratified to their increased sorrow ascanio had completed the design for his lily and mere curiosity perhaps under the influence of the magnet the wretched to those who sympathize with them he at to the hôtel d etampes it was about two o clock in and just at that hour the duchess was sitting upon surrounded by a veritable court but similar orders to were given at the louvre relating to benvenuto were given at d etampes for ascanio he was therefore at once escorted to room and his arrival was made known to the duchess trembled with joy at the thought that the young man was about to in all her splendor and gave certain orders in a low tone who had brought her the message isabeau returned to ascanio him by the hand without a word led him into a corridor raised curtain and gently pushed him forward he found himself in s salon immediately behind the arm chair of the sovereign mansion who guessed his presence more by the thrill which her whole being than by the rustling of the curtain and her fair hand to kiss over her shoulder which his lips in the position in which he stood lovely duchess was as we have said surrounded by a at her right was seated the duke of medina sidonia ambassador v monsieur de montbrion governor of charles d orléans s second son was at her left the rest of the company sat in at her feet the leading personages of the kingdom warriors statesmen artists were assembled the leaders of the which madame d etampes secretly favored great nobles all courted who had constituted themselves courtiers of the favorite was a gorgeous throng and dazzling to the eyes at first sight was enlivened with satirical remarks of all diane de poitiers mistress of the dauphin and the of madame d etampes but anne took no part in this petty quips and cranks save by a word or two thrown in at random now as softly messieurs softly no abuse of madame diane will be angry or poor madame diane she was married the was born for these sparks with which she lighted up the conversation d etampes hardly spoke to anybody beside her two neighbors with them in undertones but with great animation and not so ascanio who was humble and abashed among so many great men hear her yes monsieur de montbrion said she confidentially to her left we must make an admirable prince of your pupil he is king of the future you know i am ambitious for the dear child i am engaged at this moment in carving out an for him in case god should take his father from us a poor creature between ourselves will be king of france so our king will be a french king and we will leave madame diane to his elder brother but we will take with us with our charles heart of paris the court will be where i am monsieur de montbrion shall displace the sun we shall have great painters like primaticcio poets like clement marot who is fidgeting about yonder in without speaking a sure proof that he would like an repeat some verses to us all these people are at heart more selfish and more thirsty for glory than for money ant he who greatest wealth but he who will flatter them most freely will on his side and he who has them will be always great for shed lustre upon any place upon which their rays fall the for naught but jousting oh well let him keep the lances and we will take the pens and the brushes with us never fear de montbrion i will never allow myself to be put down diane the queen in expectancy let her wait patiently till chance give her kingdom i shall have made one for myself meanwhile what say you to the duchy of milan there you will very far from your friends at geneva for i know that you are indifferent to the new doctrine blown over from germany we will speak of this again and i will tell you things that you why has madame diane assumed to set herself up of the catholics she protects i protest that s between us an imperative gesture and a meaning glance madame d her confidences upon this subject to a close leaving of charles d orléans sadly bewildered he was on the point nevertheless but found that the duchess had already turned duke of medina sidonia have said that ascanio could hear all well monsieur l ambassadeur so madame d etampes began does finally conclude to pass through france he can hardly to tell the truth and a net on land is always preferable yawning gulf at sea his cousin henry viii would have no kidnapping him and if he escaped the english he would fall hands of the turk by land the three protestant princes would passage what can he do he must either proceed through france cruel sacrifice forego the chastisement of the rebels of ghent dear compatriots for our great emperor charles is a good burgher that is very evident in the slight respect which he has shown for royal majesty memories of that sort are what make him and circumspect to day monsieur de medina oh we understand he fears that the king of france will avenge the prisoner in spain that the prisoner at paris may pay the balance of the ransom the prisoner of the escurial o mon dieu let his mind be at ease if he does not comprehend our chivalrous loyalty he has heard i trust most assuredly madame la duchesse said the ambassador we know of françois i when left to his own devices but we fear duke paused you fear his advisers do you not rejoined the duchess yes yes i know very well that advice from a pretty mouth advice take a clever and satirical form would never fail of a king s mind it is your duty to think of that ambassadeur and take your precautions accordingly after all have full powers or if not full powers a little paper signed wherein a good many things can be inserted in a few words how it s done we have studied diplomacy indeed i once asked to make me an ambassador for i believe that i have a for negotiation yes i am sure that it would be very painful v to give up a slice of his empire in order to obtain or to assure his inviolability on the other hand flanders of the fairest jewels of his crown it is the inheritance of marie de bourgogne and it is hard to renounce the patrimony s ancestors with a stroke of the pen especially when that a great duchy which may well be transformed into a little monarchy what am i saying mon dieu i who have a perfect horror for it is universally agreed that politics and women do not together to be sure i let fall a word or two thoughtlessly then on affairs of state but if his majesty presses me and my expressing my thoughts more fully i beg him to spare me discussions and sometimes i run away and leave him alone upon them you clever diplomatist that you are and who so well will tell me that these words tossed into the air the ones which take root in minds like the king s and that which are supposed to have been blown away by the wind have more weight than a long harangue which is not listened to may be monsieur le duc de medina that may be but i am only woman engrossed with ribbons and gewgaws and you understand serious matters a thousand times better than i but the lion need of the ant the skiff may save the ship we are here to an understanding monsieur le duc and that s all we have to do if you choose madame said the ambassador it will be very who gives to day receives to morrow continued the duchess evading reply my womanly instinct will always lead me to i to perform great and generous deeds but instinct its back on reason we must also think of our interest of of france of course but i have confidence in you monsieur i will ask your advice and upon the whole i think that will do well to rely upon the king s word ah if you were in our interest madame he would not hesitate master clement marot said the duchess abruptly breaking off as if she had not heard the ambassador s last exclamation master clement marot do you not happen to have some flowing madrigal some stately sonnet to repeat to us madame said the poet sonnets and madrigals are natural your feet and grow apace in the sunshine of your lovely eyes a score of lines have come to my mind simply from looking indeed master very good we will listen to them ah messire welcome pray forgive me for not seeing you at once have of your future son in law our friend comte d orbec yes madame replied d estourville he writes that he is to return and we shall soon see him i trust half suppressed sigh made madame d etampes start but she said turning toward its author he will be welcomed by us all well vicomte de marmagne have you found the sheath of your dagger no madame but i am on the trace of it and i know how and where it now good luck to you then monsieur le vicomte good luck to you are master clement we are all ears the subject is the duchy of etampes said marot murmur of approval ran through the room and the poet recited lines in an affected voice ce plaisant val que l on nomme mainte histoire est encore embellie d

tempe that the duchess rose and all the company followed suit she justified in deeming herself the veritable queen and it was queenly gesture with which she took leave of her guests and it a queen that all sainted her as they withdrew remain she said in a low voice to ascanio obeyed when all the others had left the room it was no haughty queen but an humble and passionate woman who turned the young artist born of humble parents brought up far from the world in cloister like twilight of the studio and an unaccustomed palaces whither he had accompanied his master only on was already giddy confused dazzled by the light and conversation his mind was attacked by something very like he heard madame d etampes speak in such simple terms or rather of such grave subjects and touch lightly in upon the destinies of kings and the dismemberment of kingdoms woman like a very providence had in some sort distributed to his portion of joy or sorrow she had with the same hand and let crowns fall and lo this sovereign of the things proud as lucifer with her noble flatterers turned not only with the soft glance of the loving woman but with air of the slave who fears ascanio had suddenly become character in the play instead of a simple spectator should be said that the coquettish duchess had skilfully planned about this effect ascanio was conscious of the empire woman assumed despite his efforts to combat it not over but over his mind and like the child that he was he sought his trouble beneath a cold stern demeanor it may perhaps be had seen his spotless colombe pass like a ghost between the himself colombe with her white robe and her luminous brow footnote 7 lovely valley called the vale of tempe refreshing shade doth many a tale adorn by cool and limpid streamlets no more to

completed i completed it this morning and i have it here we have time enough ascanio said the duchess with a smile and in s voice sit you down pray well my bonny invalid what of i am entirely recovered madame so far as your shoulder is concerned but here said the duchess her hand upon the young man s heart with a graceful gesture world of sentiment in her tone i beg you madame to forget all that nonsense i am very angry for having annoyed your ladyship with it o mon dieu what means this air of constraint what means this and this harsh voice all those men wearied you did they not and as for myself i hate and abhor them but i fear them i longed to be alone with you did you not see how quickly them you are right madame i felt sadly out of place in such company i a poor artist who am here simply to show lily ah mon dieu in a moment ascanio continued the duchess head you are very cold and very sober with a friend the you were so expansive and so delightful why this change ascanio some speech of your master s who cannot endure me how listen to him ascanio come be frank you have discussed me have you not and he told you that it was dangerous to trust me the friendly feeling i had manifested for you concealed some snare told you did he not that i detest you he told me that you loved me madame retorted ascanio into her face d etampes was speechless for a moment in presence of which rushed through her mind she wished without doubt should know her love but she would have liked time to for it and to extinguish gradually without seeming interested doing his passion for colombe how that the ambuscade she was discovered she must fight her battle in the and win the victory openly if at all she made her decision second well yes said she i do love you is it a crime is it a sin even one command one s love or hatred you should never nave known that you for why tell you when you love another but that man whole truth he laid bare my heart to you and he did well ascanio upon it and you will see there adoration so deep that you can touched by it and now ascanio you must love me too mark that d etampes a potent superior nature disdainful by instinct from weariness of her surroundings had had several but not one love she had fascinated the king admiral taken her by surprise the comte de longueval caught her fancy moment but throughout all these intrigues the head had always place of the heart at last one day she found this young tender and deep which she had so often summoned without avail now another woman disputed its possession with her ah so much for that other woman she could not know what an she had to contend with all the determination and all impulses of her heart she anne d etampes would make her affection that woman did not yet know what a fatal thing be to have the duchesse d etampes for her rival the etampes who desired to have her ascanio to herself and whose such that she could with a look a word a gesture crush come between him and herself the die was cast the ambition beauty of the king s mistress were thenceforth to serve no than her love for ascanio and her jealousy of colombe colombe at that moment bending over her embroidery sitting at wheel or kneeling before her prie dieu in presence of so outspoken and so redoubtable a passion carried away and dismayed all at the same moment had said and ascanio now realized that this was no but he was deficient not in the strength to struggle but in which would have taught him to feign submission he twenty years old and was too candid to pretend he fancied that the memory of colombe the name of the innocent girl him would be an offensive and defensive weapon a sword and while on the other hand it was sure to drive the shaft into the heart of madame d etampes who perhaps would soon weary of a love in which she had no rival and no battle to wage come ascanio she resumed more calmly seeing that the young man peace alarmed perhaps by the words she had let fall let us day forget my love which an imprudent word of yours let us think now of yourself only oh i love you more on account than mine i swear to you i long to brighten your life have brightened mine you are an orphan take me for your mother heard what i said to montbrion and medina and you may have i am all ambition t is true i am ambitious but for you alone long is it since i conceived this project of creating an in the heart of italy for a son of france only since i have if i were queen there who would be the veritable king you i would cause empire and kingdom to change places ah ascanio not know me you do not know what a woman i am you see that i the whole truth i unfold my plans to you without reserve how in your turn confide in me ascanio what are your wishes that fulfil them what are your passions that i may minister to them madame i desire to be as frank and loyal as yourself and to tell truth as you have told it to me i ask nothing i wish nothing for nothing save colombe s love but she loves you not you yourself told me so i was desperate the other day true but to day who can say his eyes and his voice for you love me he added duchess was taken aback by this instance of the of true love there was a moment of silence and that for her to collect her thoughts ascanio let us not talk to day of affairs of the heart she said that request once before i make it again love isn t the whole to you men for instance have you never thirsted for wealth glory oh yes yes for a month past i have most ardently longed for them ascanio always reverting to the same idea in spite of himself there was a pause are you fond of italy anne resumed with effort yes madame said ascanio there are flowering orange groves there which it is so pleasant to wander and converse there the blue skies surrounds caresses and adorns everything that oh to fly thither with you to have you all to myself to be all to you as you would be all in all to me mon dieu mon dieu duchess likewise yielding to the irresistible force of her love she at once recovered herself fearing to frighten ascanio again continued i thought that you loved art before everything before everything i love to love said ascanio oh it is my cellini not i who throws his whole being into his work he great the marvellous the sublime artist i am a poor apprentice more i came to france with him not to acquire wealth but because i loved him that s all and it was impossible for part from him for at that time he was everything to me i have will no strength independent of his strength i became to gratify him and because he wished it as i became a of his enthusiasm for skilful and delicate carving very well said the duchess now listen to live in italy powerful almost a king to patronize artists cellini at to give him bronze and silver and gold to carve and cast and beyond all that to love and be loved say ascanio is a lovely dream it would be paradise madame if it were colombe whom i loved and me still colombe always colombe cried the duchess so be it since persistently forces itself into our words and our thoughts your colombe is here with us constantly before your eyes in your heart let us speak of her and of myself frankly hypocrisy she does not love you and you know it full well oh no i do not know it now madame but how can she love you when she is to marry another cried her father forces her perhaps her father forces her and do you think that if you loved me as her do you think that if i were in her place there is in world any force or will or power that could keep us apart oh leave everything i would fly from everything i would run to and would give you my love my honor and my life to guard no i say she does not love you and now would you have me tell else you do not love her what i not love colombe i think you said that i do not love her no you do not love her you deceive yourself at your age the need of loving for love if you had seen me first love me instead of her oh when i think that you might have but no no it is much better that you should choose me to her i do not know this colombe she is lovely and pure whatever you choose but these slips of girls know nothing your colombe would never have told you what i whom you despise just said she would have too much vanity too much diffidence shame perhaps but my love is simple and expresses itself words you despise me you think that i forget my sex and i don t dissemble some day when you know the world better you have drunk so deeply of life that you have reached sorrow then you will think better of your present injustice you will admire me but i do not choose to be admired ascanio to be loved i say again ascanio if i loved you less i false artful coquettish but i love you too well to try you i long to receive your heart as a gift not to steal it will be the end of your love for that child tell me you my best beloved and that s all but i can serve you in in the first place i have suffered for two and perhaps god my surplusage of suffering to be credited to you and then i wealth my power my experience all at your feet i will add my yours and will save you from all sorts of missteps and from of corruption to arrive at fortune or even to attain glory must often stoop to base crawling expedients you will be necessity for that with me i will lift you ever higher and higher will be your stepping stone with me you will continue to be the noble the pure ascanio but colombe colombe madame is not she too an immaculate pearl my child believe what i say replied the duchess relapsing exaltation to melancholy your pure white innocent make your life monotonous and dreary you are both too divine t make angels to be joined together but to make bad duchess s manner was so eloquent and her voice so sincere was conscious of a thrill of affectionate compassion him in spite of himself alas madame he said i see that i am indeed honored by and i am very deeply touched but it is even better to love oh how true how true that is i prefer your disdain to the king words ah me i love for the first time for the first time and the king pray do you not love him madame no i am his mistress but he is not my master but he loves you mon dieu cried anne gazing earnestly into ascanio s face both his hands in hers am i so fortunate that you are jealous the king s love offend you listen hitherto i have been in the duchess wealthy noble powerful offering to stir up and overturn thrones do you prefer the poor lonely woman out world with a simple white robe and a wild flower in her hair prefer that ascanio let us leave paris the court the world take refuge in some far off nook in your sunny italy beneath pines of rome or on the shores of your lovely bay of naples am i am ready o ascanio ascanio does it really flatter your pride i would sacrifice a crowned lover for your sake madame said ascanio whose heart was beginning to melt in the so great a passion madame my heart is too proud and too exacting cannot give me the past the past o you men you men always cruel the past in god s an unfortunate woman to be compelled to answer for her past has almost always been made what it was by events and than herself suppose that a storm should arise and a you off to italy when you return one year two years hence should you take it ill of your colombe whom you love to day because she had obeyed her parents and married orbec would you make her virtue a subject of reproach would her for obeying one of god s commandments and if she had memory to feed upon if she had never known you if in ennui crushed with grief forgotten for a moment by god sought to gain some knowledge of that paradise called love the which was closed to her if she had loved another than her husband she could not love if in a moment of delirium she had given in exchange for another she would then be ruined in your eyes in your heart she could no longer hope to be blessed by because she had not an unsullied past to give in exchange for oh i repeat it is unjust it is cruel madame who told you that is not my story listen to what i say what i declare to be the truth i say again that i have both and this poor woman whom god forgives you refuse to forgive do not understand how much greater and nobler it is to raise one from the abyss after falling into it than to pass close by it having the bandage of happiness over your eyes o ascanio i deemed you better than the others because you were younger fairer to look upon o madame reach me your hand ascanio and at one bound i will spring from of the abyss to your heart will you to morrow i will with the king the court the world oh i am valiant in love i do not wish to make myself any greater than i am it would be trifling sacrifice for me believe me all these men are not worth from you but if you would trust to me dear child you me retain my authority and continue my plans for you i would great and you men can do without love if you attain glory you you may not know it yet but you are as for the king don t be alarmed about that i will turn it aside upon some whom he will give his heart while i retain his mind choose ascanio through my means and with me or i humble through your with you look you a short time since as you know i was in and the most powerful courtiers were at my feet sit you in sit you there and behold me at your feet oh how i love to ascanio oh what bliss to see you and look into your eyes pale ascanio oh if you would but tell me that you would love day though not for a long a very long while madame madame cried ascanio hiding his face in his hands eyes and ears so conscious was he of the potent fascination aspect and the accent of the siren do not call me madame do not call me anne said the duchess his hands call me louise it is also my name but a name no one has ever called me and it shall be yours louise do you not think it a sweet name ascanio i know one sweeter still replied ascanio beware ascanio cried the wounded lioness if you make me suffer i may perhaps come to hate you as much as i love you mon dieu replied the young man shaking his head as if to avert mon dieu you confuse my thoughts and overwhelm my heart am have i a fever am i dreaming if i say harsh things to you me for i do it to awaken myself i see you lovely adored here at my feet it cannot be that such temptations exist lead souls to perdition ah you are as you say in an abyss of rising out of it yourself you would draw me in oh do my weakness to such a trial there is neither temptation nor trial nor dream there is reality for us both i love you ascanio i love you you love me but you will repent of your love hereafter and me some day for what you have brought into my life or what taken away from yours ah you do not know me cried the duchess if you think me to repent stay will you have a pledge hastily seated herself at a table upon which were and seizing a pen dashed off a few words take this she said and doubt me again if you dare took the paper and read ascanio i love you go with me where i go or go with you where you go anne d heilly oh that cannot be madame it seems to me that my love would be of shame to you shame cried the duchess do i know shame i am too proud for that pride is my virtue ah i know a lovelier and more saintly virtue than that said ascanio to the thought of colombe with a desperate effort blow struck home the duchess rose trembling with indignation you are an obstinate hard hearted child ascanio she said in voice i would fain have spared you much suffering but i sorrow alone can teach you what life is you will come back to me you will return wounded bleeding heartbroken and you then the worth of your colombe and of myself i will forgive because i love you but ere that time comes terrible things au revoir madame d etampes wild with love and hatred left the room that the two lines she had written in a moment of in ascanio s hands as a soon as ascanio was out of madame d etampes s presence influence which emanated from her disappeared and he more see clearly the condition of his own heart as well as going on about him how he recalled two things he had said love him since the duchesse d etampes loved him thenceforth did not belong to him his instinct had served him well these two thoughts to him but it had led him astray when him to give utterance to them if the honest upright soul young man had been capable of descending to dissimulation all been well but he had simply put the wounded and much to be on her guard the struggle henceforth was to be the in that colombe only was threatened this passionate and perilous scene with the duchess was to ascanio in one respect he carried away from it a new of exaltation and confidence his mind excited by the had witnessed as well as by its own efforts was more active and more inclined to audacious deeds so that he to find out what basis there might be for his hopes and the depths of colombe s heart though he were to find nothing indifference there if colombe really loved comte d orbec longer against madame d etampes she might do what she a rebellious despised desolate despairing existence he would he would become gloomy and evil minded what matter if but first of all he must put an end to his doubts and go with step to meet his fate if worse came to worst etampes s promise would take care of the future arrived at this decision as he returned along the quay sun sink in a sea of flame behind the black frowning tour de nesle he reached the hôtel without delay or hesitation he went put together a few jewels then resolutely knocked four times at leading to the petit nesle perrine chanced to be in the neighborhood with astonishment with curiosity she made haste to open the gate but when the apprentice she felt called upon to assume a very ah is it you monsieur ascanio what do you wish i wish to show these jewels to mademoiselle colombe immediately perrine is she in the garden yes in her path but wait young man wait for me who had not forgotten the road walked swiftly away another thought to the governess let us see said she stopping to reflect i think my best course to join them but to leave colombe free to select her purchases gifts it would not be becoming for me to be there if as she puts something aside for me i will arrive when she her purchases and then i should certainly be very refuse that s what i ll do stay here and not embarrass the dear hearted child will be seen that the good woman was not deficient in delicacy ten days past colombe had not found it necessary to ask herself had become her dearest thought the pure souled did not know what love was but her heart was overflowing she told herself that she did wrong to indulge in such dreams excused herself on the ground that she certainly should never again and that she should not have the consolation herself in his eyes this pretext she passed all her evenings upon the bench where sat beside her and there she would talk to him listen to him her whole soul upon the memory and when the darkness and dame perrine bade her retire the lovely dreamer would return house with reluctant steps and not until she was recalled would she remember her father s commands comte d orbec and flight of time her sleepless nights were hard to bear but so to efface the charm of her visions of the evening this evening as usual colombe was living over again the she had passed with ascanio when happening to raise her eyes a sharp cry was standing before her gazing at her in silence found her changed but lovelier than ever pallor and melancholy becoming to her ideally beautiful face she seemed to belong to earth and so ascanio gazing admiringly upon her was assailed once more by his former modest apprehensions d etampes s passion had dissipated for a moment how could creature ever love him two lovely children who had loved each other so long without and who had already suffered so much were at last face to face ought no doubt to have traversed in an instant the space they step by step and separately in their dreams they might to an understanding first of all and then allow all their up emotion to find expression in an outburst of joy they were both too timid for that and although their each to the other their angel hearts did not come they had first made a detour speechless and blushing had risen to her feet by a ascanio pale with the intensity of his emotion repressed trembling hand the rapid beating of his heart both began to speak at once he to say forgive me mademoiselle you gave me leave to show you some jewels she to say i am see that you are entirely recovered monsieur ascanio ceased speaking simultaneously but nevertheless they had each other and ascanio emboldened by the involuntary the incident naturally brought to the maiden s lips rejoined somewhat more assurance are you so kind as to remember that i was wounded indeed yes and dame perrine and i have been very anxious not to see you i did not intend to come again why not pray this decisive moment ascanio was fain to lean against a tree but in a moment he summoned all his strength and all and said breathlessly i may confess it now i loved you and now question came from colombe s lips almost without her knowledge have put to flight all the doubts of an older hand than ascanio it simply revived his hopes a little now alas he continued i have measured the distance that us and i know that you are happily betrothed to a noble count happily interposed colombe with a bitter smile what you do not love the count great god pray tell me is he of you he is rich and powerful far above me but you have seen him no and i was afraid to inquire besides i cannot say why but i that he was young and attractive and that he was agreeable he is older than my father and he frightens me said colombe faee in her hands with a gesture of abhorrence which she could illustration 04 beside himself with joy fell on his knees with clasped hands as death his eyes half closed but a sublime light shone out his eyelids and a smile fit to rejoice god s heart played colorless lips what is the matter ascanio said colombe in alarm what is the matter cried the young man finding in the excess of the audacity which sorrow first gave him what is the matter why love you colombe ascanio ascanio murmured colombe in a tone that was half reproof pleasure and it must be said as soft as a confession of love they understood each other their hearts were united and were conscious of it their lips had followed suit my friend said colombe softly pushing ascanio away gazed into one another s faces in ecstasy the two each other at last life does not contain two such moments and so said ascanio you do not love comte d orbec you are free me my friend said colombe in her sweet grave voice no one save ever kissed me before and he alas very rarely i am child and i know nothing of life but i know from the your kiss caused me that it is my duty henceforth to belong you or to heaven yes if it were otherwise i am sure that it a crime your lips have consecrated me your fiancée and your wife though my father himself should say no i would listen only to of god which says yes in my heart here is my hand which angels of paradise hear her and envy me cried ascanio ecstasy is not to be pictured or described let those who remember ft is impossible to put upon paper the words the hand pressures of these pure hearted lovely children souls flowed together as do the waters from two springs changing their nature or their color ascanio did not sully shadow of an impure thought the chaste brow of his beloved her head in perfect trust upon her lover s shoulder had the looked down upon them from on high she would not have turned away one begins to love one is in haste to bring to the support of all that he can of his past present and future as soon as speak calmly ascanio and colombe described to each other sorrows all their hopes of the days just gone by it to both to find that each had the other s story to tell suffered much and they smiled upon each other as they suffering when they came to speak of the future then they became serious what had god in store for them for the morrow according to laws they were made for each other but human prejudices their union ill assorted monstrous what were they to do comte d orbec to renounce his wife how persuade the provost to give his daughter to an artisan alas my friend said colombe i promised you that i would belong or to heaven i see that it must be to heaven no said ascanio to me two children like ourselves cannot move alone but i will speak to my dear master benvenuto cellini powerful colombe and sees all things from a higher level he earth as god ordains in heaven and whatever his will has accomplishes he will give you to me i do not know how he will but i am sure he loves obstacles he will speak to king françois will persuade your father the only thing he could not bring to did without his intervention you loved me the rest ought to simple you see that i believe in miracles now my best beloved dear ascanio you hope and i hope would you like me also to try there is a person whose influence over my father s mind shall i not write to madame d etampes madame d etampes cried ascanio mon dieu i had forgotten her he told her simply and without affectation how he had duchess how she had declared her love for him and how that within an hour she had pronounced herself the enemy of but of what consequence was it benvenuto s task would be more difficult that was all one adversary more would him my dear said colombe you have faith in your master and i in you speak to cellini as soon as

every one s sight and with view of the surrounding country faith it s not a bad idea said benvenuto with a laugh and did you make scozzone i replied with a great burst of laughter which i could not keep back which sorely disappointed mons pagolo he undertook then to be to reproach me with having no heart and with wishing to death and so forth and so forth all the time working away and file he talked to me in that strain for a full half hour he s a loquacious rascal when he gives his mind to it what reply did you give him finally scozzone what reply just as you knocked at the door and he placed his clasp at last upon the table i took his hand and said to him pagolo you have talked like a jewel that was why you looking so like an idiot when you came in you were wrong scozzone you

me to my work tripped lightly away laughing in pleased anticipation of trick cellini proposed to play upon pagolo of the nature of which she could not form the least conception when she had left him did not resume his work as he he rushed to the window which looked obliquely upon the garden petit nesle and stood there in rapt contemplation a knock at rudely aroused him from his reverie hail and tempest he cried in a rage who is there now can i not in peace ten thousand devils forgive me master said ascanio s voice if i disturb you i will what is it you my child no no surely not you never disturb me is it pray what do you want with me lost no time in opening the door for his beloved pupil i interfere with your solitude and your work said ascanio no ascanio you are always welcome master i have a secret to confide to you a service to ask of you speak will you have my purse do you need my arm or my thoughts i may have need of them all dear master so much the better i am yours body and soul ascanio i have to make to you too yes a confession for although i no sin i think still i shall have some remorse until i by you but do you speak first very well master but great heaven what is that cast interrupting himself eye had just fallen upon the statue of hebe and in the statue colombe it is hebe replied benvenuto with glistening eyes it is of youth do you think it beautiful ascanio oh wonderful but those features i know them i cannot be mistaken rash boy since you raise the veil half way i must needs snatch altogether and so after all your confidence will come sit down ascanio you shall have my heart spread out before an open book you need me you say i too need that you me i shall be relieved of a great weight when you know all sat down paler than the culprit about to listen to the the death sentence you are a florentine ascanio and i do not need to ask you if you story of dante alighieri one day he saw a child named along the street and he loved her the child died and he still for it was her soul that he loved and souls do not die crowned her with a crown of stars and placed her in paradise he set about analyzing human passions sounding the depths and philosophy and when purified by suffering be readied the gates of heaven where virgil that is was to leave him he was not obliged to stop for lack of because he found beatrice that is love awaiting him on ascanio i have my beatrice dead like the other and adored as this has been hitherto a secret between god and her and myself weak to resist temptation but my adoration for her has amid all the impure passions to which i have yielded i my light too high for corruption to reach it the man into dissipation the artist remained true to his and if i have done anything creditable ascanio if silver or clay has been made to assume form and life under if i have sometimes succeeded in imparting beauty to marble to bronze it has been because my resplendent vision has given support and instruction for twenty years past but i know not how it is ascanio perhaps there is a the poet and the goldsmith between the moulder of ideas moulder of gold dante dreams i need to see the name of maria sufficient to him i must have before me the face of the madonna his creations we touch mine that perhaps is why my beatrice enough or rather was too much for me a sculptor her mind was with me but i was compelled to seek the human form the who shed a bright light upon my life had been beautiful beautiful above all in the qualities of her heart but not realize the type of undying beauty upon which my i found myself constrained therefore to seek elsewhere now tell me this ascanio do you think that if my sculptor s presented itself to me living on this earth and if i had bestowed of my admiration upon it i should have been ungrateful to my poetic ideal do you think that my celestial in that case have ceased to visit me that the angel would of the woman do you think it i ask you the question ascanio you will know some day why i ask it of you rather than why i tremble as i await your reply as if you were herself master said ascanio gravely and sadly i am too young to have upon such lofty subjects i think however in my heart are one of the chosen men whom god leads and that what you your path has been placed there by god not by chance that is really your belief is it not ascanio you are of opinion terrestrial angel the realization of my longing would be sent and that the other celestial angel would not be angry at in that case i may venture to tell you that i have found that it is living that i can sec it and almost touch it the model of all beauty of all purity the type of to which we artists aspire is near at hand it breathes can admire it every day ah all that i have done hitherto is compared with what i will do this hebe which you and which is in very truth my chef d œuvre does me as yet my living dream stands beside its image and seems a hundred times more glorious but i will attain it i will ascanio a thousand white statues all of which resemble it forming and rising in my brain i see them i feel and some day they will come forth and now ascanio would you like me to show you my lovely inspiration should be close by us every morning when the sun rises it me from below look drew the curtain aside from the window and pointed to of the petit nesle her leafy avenue colombe was walking slowly along her head her hand how fair she is is she not said benvenuto ecstatically phidias michel angelo created nothing purer and the ancients if do not surpass that graceful young head how beautiful she is ah yes beautiful indeed murmured ascanio who had resumed his seat strength to move or to think was a moment s pause while benvenuto feasted upon his joy brooded over his pain but master the apprentice timidly ventured to say where will s passion lead you what do you mean to do ascanio replied cellini she who is dead is not and cannot be mine simply showed her to me and did not implant any human love for my heart strangely enough he did not even lead me to feel what to me until he had taken her from the world she is naught but in my life a vague indistinct image but if you have colombe more nearly touches my existence my heart i dare to i dare to say to myself she shall be mine she is the daughter of the provost of paris said ascanio trembling and even if she were a king s daughter ascanio you know what my capable of i have attained whatever object i have sought to attain i never longed for aught more ardently i know not as yet by i shall gain my end but she must be my wife your wife colombe your wife i will apply to my mighty sovereign continued benvenuto i the louvre and chambord with statues if he wishes i will tables with ewers and candelabra and when i ask no other price he will not he françois i if he refuses o ascanio i i am hopeful i will seek him in the midst of his whole court three days hence when he starts for saint germain you will me we will carry the silver salt box which is completed and for a gateway at fontainebleau every one will admire them are fine and he will admire them and will marvel more than i will give him a similar surprise every week i have never of a more fruitful creative power my brain is boiling day this love of mine ascanio has increased my power and youth when françois sees all his wishes gratified as soon as formed ah then i will no longer request but demand he will great and i will make myself rich and the provost of paris for provostship will be honored by the alliance upon my soul ascanio am going mad such thoughts make me lose control of myself she mine of heaven do you realize what it means ascanio colombe mine me my child since i have confessed it all to you i dare to my hopes my heart is calmer now you have in a my happiness you will understand some day what i mean meanwhile it seems to me that i love you more dearly since received my confidence it was good of you to listen embrace me ascanio but you do not seem to think master that perhaps she doesn t oh hush ascanio i have thought of it and then i have envied and beauty but what you say of the far seeing designs of me she is waiting for me to come to her whom should some courtier fop altogether unworthy of her furthermore he may be for whom she is destined i am as nobly born as he i have more genius comte d orbec they say is hex fiancé comte d orbec so much the better i know him he is the king and i go to him for the gold and silver to be used in and for the sums which his majesty s bounty allots to me orbec is a crabbed worn out old curmudgeon he doesn t count will be little glory in supplanting such an animal go to it is i whom she will love not for my sake but for her own i shall be the demonstration of her loveliness so to speak she will be appreciated adored immortalized moreover i i wish it and i say again i never have used that phrase have not succeeded there is no human power which can hold out energy of my passion i shall as always go straight to my goal the inflexibility of destiny she shall be mine i tell you have to turn the whole kingdom topsy turvy and if perchance any block my way demonio let him beware you know me ascanio kill him with this hand now grasping thine but forgive me in god s name egotist that i am i forget that you have to confide to me and a service to ask at my hands i shall my debt to you dear child but say on say on for you as well i can do what it is my will to do you are wrong master there are things which god alone can do and that i must rely upon him and none other i will leave my secret between my feebleness and his might left the room had hardly closed the door when cellini drew the green curtain and his table by the

germain they were awaiting the coming of the king and queen to go to except a few ladies who were seated everybody was moving place to place laughing and talking there was the rustle of brocades and the clash of swords loving and defiant glances together with arrangements for future meetings of amorous purport it was a dazzling bewildering scene of confusion the costumes were superb and cut in the latest style adding to the rich and interesting variety were pages dressed italian or spanish fashion standing like statues with arms akimbo swords at their sides it was a picture overflowing with magnificence of which all that we could say would be but a and colorless description bring to life all the dandified cavaliers all the sportive easy mannered ladies who figure pages of brantôme and the heptameron put in their mouths clever outspoken idiomatic eminently french speech of century and you will have an idea of this seductive court if you recall the saying of françois i a court is a year without spring or a spring without flowers the françois i was a perpetual spring where the loveliest and earthly flowers bloomed the first bewilderment caused by the confusion and uproar it to see that there were two hostile camps in the throng one by lilac favors was that of madame d etampes the other colors were blue hoisted the flag of diane de poitiers those adhered to the reformed religion belonged to the first faction unadulterated catholics to the other among the latter could be dull uninteresting countenance of the dauphin the intelligent blonde features of charles d orléans the king s second son here and there through the ranks of the faction of etampes conceive these political and religious antipathies to by the jealousy of women and the rivalry of artists and will be a grand total of hatred which will sufficiently explain you are surprised at them a myriad of scornful glances gestures which all the courtier like dissembling in cannot conceal from the observation of the spectator two deadly enemies anne and diane were seated at the opposite the room but notwithstanding the distance between them not elapsed before every stinging quip uttered by one of them way to the ears of the other and the retort forwarded by the returned as quickly by the same road all these silk and velvet clad noblemen in an atmosphere of in his long doctor s robe stern featured but indifferent henri estienne devotedly attached to the cause of while not two steps away and equally oblivious of stood the florentine refugee pietro strozzi pale leaning against a pillar and gazing doubtless in his far off italy whither he was destined to return in chains there no repose save in the tomb we need not say that the nobly a kinsman through his mother of catherine de medicis and soul devoted to the catholic party too talking together of momentous affairs of state and to look each other in the face as if to give more weight they were saying were old montmorency to whom the king had than two years before the office of constable vacant since of bourbon and the chancellor poyet bursting with pride over tax he had imposed and the ordinance of villers cotterets by him 8 with none of the various groups taking part in the benedictine and cordelier françois rabelais with which showed his white teeth watched and listened and sneered triboulet his majesty s favorite jester rolled his humpback biting jests around between the legs of the guests taking his pygmy like stature to bite here and there without danger if pain marot resplendent in a brand new coat as valet de chambre king seemed fully as uncomfortable as on the day of his the hôtel d etampes it was evident that he had in his pocket fatherless sonnet which he was seeking to dress in the guise of conception but alas we all know that inspiration comes high and we cannot control it a ravishing idea had come to his upon the name of madame diane he struggled against it but is a mistress not a lover the lines formed themselves without the rhymes matched themselves to one another as if by power which he could not control in fine the wretched him more than we can say he was devoted to madame d question and to marguerite de navarre that too as was the fact that the protestant party was the which his sympathies leaned it may even be that he was in an epigram against madame diane when this madrigal in her honor his mind but come it did and how we pray to know when such were evolved in his brain in laudation of a catholic could despite his zeal for the protestant cause to confide them in to some appreciative friend of literary tastes is what poor marot did but the injudicious cardinal de tournon bosom he intrusted his verses deemed them so beautiful that in spite of himself he passed them on to m le lorraine who lost no time in telling madame diane of them was a great whispering among the partisans of the blue in of which marot was imperatively summoned and called upon them the lilacs when they saw marot making his way through toward madame diane hastened in the same direction and the poet enchanted and terrified at the same time at last d etampes herself left her place being curious as she said see how that knave marot 9 who had so much wit would set madame diane clement marot as he was about to begin after bowing low to poitiers who smiled upon him turned his head slightly to and caught the eye of madame d etampes she also smiled upon him the smile of the one was gracious and of the other awe inspiring so it was with a trembling and uncertain voice that poor marot up on one side and frozen on the other repeated the etre phœbus bien souvent je désire pour connaître herbes divinement la douleur que mon cœur veut se guérit par herbe aucunement pour avoir ma place au firmament pour son arc encontre amour laisir à mon roi ne veux être rebelle phœbus seulement je désir être aimé de diane la belle 10 had barely littered the last syllable of this charming madrigal the blues applauded vociferously while the lilacs preserved silence thereupon emboldened by the applause on the one hand chagrined by the frigid reception accorded his effusion on he boldly presented the chef d œuvre to madame de poitiers to diane the fair he said in an undertone bowing to the her you understand madame fair in your own right and thanked him with her sweetest smile and marot turned away one may venture to write verses in praise of a fair one after the same in honor of the fairest said the ill fated as he passed madame d etampes you remember madame la plus belle replied with a withering glance groups composed of acquaintances of the reader stood aloof throng during this incident in one were ascanio and cellini was weak enough to prefer the divina commedia to the other group consisted of comte d orbec the vicomte messire d estourville and colombe who had implored not to mingle with the crowd with which she then came in the first time and which caused her no other sensation than terror d orbec gallantly refused to leave his fiancée who was to by the provost to the queen after mass and colombe although they were equally bewildered by surroundings had spied each other at once and from time stealthily exchanged glances the two pure hearted timid children of whom had been reared in the solitude which makes noble hearts have been isolated and lost indeed in that gorgeous and had they not been so situated that they could see and strengthen and encourage each other had not met since the day they confessed their love half a times ascanio had tried to gain admission to the petit nesle in vain the new servant presented to colombe by comte d orbec answered his knock instead of dame perrine and dismissed ascanio was neither rich enough nor bold enough to buy the woman furthermore he had naught but sad news which learn only too soon to impart to his beloved the news of s avowal of his own passion for colombe and the not only of doing without his support but perhaps of contend against him to the course to be pursued ascanio felt as he had said to cellini god alone could now save him and being left to his own had in his innocence resolved to attempt to soften etampes when a hope upon which one has confidently relied is blasted is always tempted to have recourse to the most desperate expedients all powerful energy of benvenuto not only had failed ascanio undoubtedly be turned against him ascanio determined therefore the trustfulness of youth to appeal to what he believed he of grandeur and nobleness and generosity in the character d etampes in an attempt to arouse the sympathy of her by whom beloved with his suffering afterward if that last fragile from his hand what could he do a poor weak friendless child wait that was why he had accompanied benvenuto to court duchesse d etampes had returned to her place he joined the her courtiers reached a position behind her and finally making his way to her chair chancing to turn her head she saw him ah is it you ascanio she said coldly yes madame la duchesse i came hither with my master benvenuto excuse for venturing to address you is my desire to know if you dissatisfied with the drawing of the lily which you me to prepare and which i left at the hôtel d etampes day no in very truth i think it most beautiful said madame d etampes mollified and connoisseurs to whom i have shown it de guise here are entirely of my opinion but will work be as perfect as the drawing and if you think that promise that it will will my gems be sufficient yes madame i hope so i should have liked however to place on of the flower a large diamond which would glisten there like of dew but it would be too great an expense perhaps to incur for intrusted to an humble artist like myself oh we can indulge in that extravagance ascanio but a diamond of that size would be worth some two hundred madame very well we will reflect thereon but added the duchess voice confer a favor upon me ascanio i am at your service madame a moment since while listening to marot s insipid trash i spied orbec at the other end of the room find him out if you please to him that i would speak with him what madame exclaimed ascanio turning pale at the count s name did you not say that you were at my service continued etampes haughtily moreover my reason for asking you to commission is that you are interested in the subject of i wish to have with comte d orbec and it may well give for reflection if they who are in love do ever reflect i will obey you madame said ascanio apprehensive lest he her at whose hands he hoped to obtain salvation very good pray address the count in italian i have my reasons you to do so and return to me with him to avoid the danger of any further collision with foe walked away and asked a young nobleman wearing a if he had seen comte d orbec and where he was there he is was the reply that old ape whispering with the paris and standing so near that lovely girl lovely girl was colombe at whom all the dandies were gazing curiosity the old ape seemed to ascanio as repulsive as a rival could desire after scrutinizing him for a moment up to him and to colombe s unbounded amazement accosted him requesting him to go with himself to madame d etampes excused himself to his fiancée and friends and made haste the duchess s command followed by ascanio who did not take until he had bestowed a significant reassuring glance upon who was confounded by the extraordinary message and more else by the sight of the messenger ah count good morning said madame d etampes as her eye fell orbec i am charmed to see you for i have matters of importance with you messieurs she added addressing those who near we have still a quarter of an hour to await the their majesties and if you will allow me i will seize to talk with my old friend comte d orbec the noblemen who had crowded about the duchess hastened to aside in obedience to this unceremonious dismissal and with the king s treasurer in one of the window embrasures as one of our salons of to day ascanio was about to do as the rest did at a sign from the duchess he remained who is this young man queried the count an italian page who does not understand a word of french you may him exactly as if we were alone very well madame rejoined d orbec i have obeyed your without even seeking to know your motives you expressed a my future wife should be presented to the queen to day colombe with her father but now that i have complied with your command that i should be glad to understand it do i presume too much in asking you for some little explanation you are the most devoted of my faithful friends d orbec happily still much that i can do for you but i do not know if i shall able to pay my debt to you however i will try this i have given you is simply the corner stone upon which i build your fortune count madame said d orbec bowing to the ground i am about to speak frankly to you therefore but before all let my congratulations i saw your colombe just now she is beautiful a little awkward but that adds to her charm between ourselves i have racked my brain in vain i know you cannot understand with what object you a serious prudent man enamored i fancy of youth and beauty are entering into i say with what object for there must necessarily underneath it you are not the man to take such a step dame one must settle down madame and the father is an old has ducats to leave to his daughter but how old is he pray oh some fifty five or six years and you count about the same age but he is so used up i begin to understand and to recognize your fine hand i knew that above mere vulgar sentiment and that yonder child s not constitute the attraction for you fie madame i have never even thought of them if she had been ugly have been all the same she happens to be pretty so much oh that s all right count otherwise i should despair of you and now that you have found me madame will you deign to inform me oh it is simply that i am indulging in some beautiful dreams for you duchess interposed where i would like to see you d orbec do is in poyet s place for i detest him she added with glance at the chancellor who was still walking with what madame one of the most exalted posts in the realm well are you not yourself an eminent man count but alas my power precarious my throne is upon the brink of an abyss even at i am in mortal terror the king has for a mistress the wife of a petty judge named féron if the woman were ambitious be ruined i ought to have taken the initiative myself in of his majesty s ah i shall never find another like the de brissac whom i presented to him a sweet woman of no character a mere child i shall always weep for her she was and talked to the king of nothing but my perfections she assumed all the burdens of my position and left me all but this féronnière as they call her why it requires power to draw françois i away from her i have exhausted my of seductions and am driven alas to my last intrenchment how so madame mon dieu yes i devote myself almost exclusively to his mind now heart is elsewhere you can understand how much i need an auxiliary can i find her a devoted sincere friend of whom i can be sure i would repay her with such quantities of gold and such a host seek out such a one for me d orbec you know how closely and the man are allied in the person of our sovereign and to the man can lead the king on if we could be not rivals not mistresses but friends if while one held sway the other might hold sway over françois i france would count and at what a moment just as charles v is about to our net of his own free will when we can hold him to ransom terms as we choose and take advantage of his imprudence to a magnificent future in case of accident i will explain to you d orbec this diane who pleases you so much would threaten our fortunes and the chevalier de france but here is the king was the way of madame d etampes she rarely explained her meaning left it to be guessed she would sow ideas in a man s mind and ambition and natural perversity at work and then she interrupt herself a great and useful art which cannot highly commended to many poets and innumerable lovers it was that comte d orbec eager in the pursuit of gain and honors to the last degree and worn out by years and dissipation understood the duchess whose eyes more than once during had wandered toward colombe s noble and straightforward nature was quite incapable the depths of this mystery of iniquity and infamy but he had foreboding that this strange and ominous conversation terrible peril for his beloved and he gazed at madame d etampes usher announced the king and queen in an instant everybody hat in hand god have you in his keeping messieurs said françois as he room i have some weighty news which i must make known to you our dear brother the emperor charles v is at this moment for france if he has not already passed the frontier let messieurs to welcome him worthily i need not remind my of the obligations imposed upon us by the laws of such a time we proved at the field of the cloth of gold that how kings should be received within the month charles v will the louvre and i my lords said queen eleanora in her sweet voice thank you in my royal brother s name for the welcome you will accord him nobles replied with shouts of vive le roi vive la reine empereur that moment something wriggled its way along between the legs of toward the king it was triboulet sire said the fool will you permit me to dedicate to your majesty i am about to print with all the pleasure in the world fool the king replied but first know the title of the work and how far advanced it is sire the work will be entitled the almanac of fools and a list of the greatest idiots that the world has ever seen the progress i have made with it i have already inscribed upon page the name of the king of all fools past and to come who might this illustrious worthy be whom you give me for cousin for king of fools charles v sire charles v cried the king and why charles v because there is no other than charles v in the world who you a prisoner at madrid as he did would be insane enough through your majesty s dominions but suppose that he does pass through the very heart of my accident in that case said triboulet i promise to erase his name and in its place whose name will that be queried the king yours sire for in allowing him to pass you will show yourself fool than he king roared with laughter the courtiers echoed his merriment alone turned pale very good said françois put my name in place of the emperor s for i have given my word of honor and i ll stand to it as to i accept it and here is the price of the first copy that the king tossed a well filled purse to triboulet who in his teeth and hopped away on all fours growling like a dog bone madame said the provost of paris to the queen as he stepped colombe will your majesty permit me to avail myself of moment to present to you under happy auspices my whom you have condescended to receive as one of your maids kindly queen addressed a few words of congratulation to poor abashed colombe at whom the king meanwhile in admiration by my halidome messire le prévôt said françois smiling do that it s nothing less than high treason to have kept such a long buried and out of sight a pearl so well adapted to shine garland of beauties who surround the majesty of our queen if not punished for the felony messire robert you may thank the of those lovely downcast eyes the king with a graceful salutation to the charming girl on to the chapel followed by the whole court madame said the duke of medina sidonia offering his hand to d etampes shall we not allow the throng to pass and remain behind we shall be more conveniently situated here for a word or two of importance which i have to say to you i am at your service monsieur l ambassadeur replied the duchess go comte d orbec you may say anything monsieur de medina old friend who is my second self and this young man who but italian their discretion is of no less consequence to you than to me madame if you feel sure of them but we are alone and i will go the point without digression or concealment you understand that majesty has determined to pass through france that he is in already within her boundaries he is well aware however his path lies between two long lines of enemies but he relies chivalrous loyalty of the king you have yourself advised him so madame and i frankly admit that having vastly more power titular minister you have enough influence over françois to set for the emperor or guarantee his safety according as your friendly or unfriendly but why should you turn against us it for the state s interest nor your own to do so go on monseigneur you have not said all that you have to say no madame charles v is a worthy successor of charlemagne and what ally might demand from him as ransom he proposes to bestow as and to leave neither hospitality nor friendly counsel unrewarded superb he will act with no less discretion than grandeur king françois i has always ardently desired the duchy of milan and charles will consent to cede that province a never of contention between france and spain in consideration of rent charge i understand said the duchess the emperor s finances are in condition as everybody knows on the other hand is ruined by a score of wars and his sacred majesty would sorry to transfer his claim from a poor to an opulent debtor monsieur de medina you must yourself understand that such could not be acceptable but madame overtures have already been made to his majesty on of this investiture and he seemed delighted with the idea i know it but i refuse if you can dispense with my consent so better for you madame the emperor is especially desirous to know that you are in and whatever you may desire my influence is not merchandise to be bought and sold ambassadeur o madame who implied such a thing hark ye you assure me that your master desires my support and he is wise very well to promise it to him i demand less offers follow me closely this is what he must do he must i the investiture of the duchy of milan but as soon as left france behind he must remember the violated treaty of madrid forget his promise why that would mean war madame stay a moment monsieur de medina his majesty will cry out no doubt thereupon charles will consent to make the independent state and will give it free of all tribute to orléans the king s second son in that way the emperor will a rival that will be worth a few crowns to him monseigneur i think that you can have nothing to say against it as to desires i may have as you suggested a moment since if majesty enters into my plans he may let fall in my presence first interview a bauble of more or less brilliancy which i up if it is worth the trouble and retain as a souvenir of alliance concluded between the successor of the cæsars spain and the indies and myself duchess turned to ascanio who was as terrified by her dark schemes as the duke of medina was disturbed by them and d orbec seemed delighted all this for you ascanio she whispered to win your heart i france well monsieur l ambassadeur she continued aloud what have you to say to that the emperor alone can decide upon a matter of such gravity madame everything leads me to believe that he will acquiesce arrangement which almost terrifies me it seems so favorable to us if it will set your mind at rest i will say to you that it is equally favorable to me and that is why i undertake to make accept it we women have our own political schemes more than yours but i can promise you that mine are in no to your interests indeed how could they be meanwhile pending the decision of charles v you may be sure that not lose an opportunity to act against him and that i shall do to induce his majesty to detain him as a prisoner what madame is this your way of beginning an alliance go to monsieur l ambassadeur can a statesman like yourself fail that the most essential thing for me is to put aside all undue influence and that to espouse your cause openly would be method of ruining it moreover i do not propose that any ever be able to betray me or denounce me let me be your enemy le duc and let me talk against you what does it matter do you not know what mere words amount to if charles v refuses my terms i will say to the king sire trust to my instinct you must not recoil before just and and if the emperor accepts i will say sire trust to that is to say feline sharpness you must resign yourself an infamous but advantageous act ah madame said the duke of medina bowing low what a pity it you should be a queen you would have made such a that the duke took leave of madame d etampes and walked away with the unexpected turn the negotiations had taken now it is my purpose to speak plainly and without circumlocution duchess to comte d orbec when she was alone with ascanio and him you know three things count first that it is most important for and myself that my power should at this moment be put and beyond the reach of attack secondly that when is once carried through we shall have no occasion to future that charles d orléans will fill the place of françois i that the duke of milan whom i shall have made what he is will much more gratitude than the king of france who has made me what thirdly that your colombe s beauty has made a vivid impression majesty very well i address myself now count to the who is not influenced by vulgar prejudices you hold in your own hands at this moment do you choose that orbec should succeed chancelier poyet or in more positive terms colombe d orbec should succeed marie de brissac in his horror made a movement which d orbec did not notice met the searching gaze of madame d etampes with a villanous leer i desire to be chancellor he replied briefly good then we are both saved but what of the provost oh said the count you can find some fat office for him only let lucrative rather than honorable i beg it will all fall to me gouty old rascal dies could contain himself no longer madame he exclaimed in a voice of thunder stepping forward had no time to say more the count had no time to be astonished folding doors were thrown open and the whole court flocked in d etampes roughly seized ascanio s hand and drew him aside as she said in his ear in a suppressed voice trembling now do you see young man how one becomes a king s plaything life sometimes leads us in our own despite said no more her words were interrupted by the uproarious and witty sallies of the king and courtiers i was radiant for charles v was coming there would fêtes surprises a glorious part for him to play world would have its eyes fixed upon paris and its king he with childish joy to the performance of the drama of which all the threads it was his nature to look at everything on rather than on the serious side to aim more at effect else and to look upon battles as tournaments and upon an art with a mind well stored with strange poetic françois i made of his reign a theatrical performance with for play house this day as he was on the eve of dazzling a rival and europe and benignity were more charming than ever if reassured by his smiling face triboulet rolled up to him just passed through the door o sire sire cried the fool dolefully i come to take my leave your majesty must make up your mind to lose me and i weep for than for myself what will become of your majesty without whom you love so dearly what you are going to leave me fool at this moment when there is fool for two kings yes sire at this moment when there are two kings for one fool but i do not propose to have it so triboulet i order you to remain in that case pray see that monsieur de vieilleville is informed of pleasure for i but told him what people say of his wife and simple a matter he swore that he would cut off my ears in the and then tear out my soul if i had one added the whose tongue your majesty should order to be cut out for la la rejoined the king have no fear my poor fool the man take your life would be very sure to be hanged a quarter of after o sire if it makes no difference to you well what have him hanged a quarter of an hour before i much prefer that whole assemblage roared with laughter the king above all as he walked on he passed pietro strozzi the noble signor pietro strozzi he said it is a long time altogether i confess since you requested letters of naturalization at it is a disgrace to us that after having fought so valiantly for the french and like a true frenchman you do not yet us since your country by birth denies you this evening messire le maçon my secretary will take steps to hasten of your letters of naturalization do not thank me for and your own charles v must find you a frenchman ah there cellini and you never come empty handed what have you under my friend but stay a moment it shall not be said i faith did not surpass you in munificence messire antoine le maçon see that letters of naturalization are issued to my good at the same time with the great pietro strozzi s and you them without expense to him a goldsmith cannot put his hand hundred ducats so readily as a strozzi sire said benvenuto i thank your majesty but i pray you to ignorance what are these letters of naturalization what exclaimed antoine le maçon with great gravity while the like a madman at the question do you not know that letters of naturalization are the greatest honor can bestow upon a foreigner that you thereby become i begin to understand sire and i thank you again said cellini me as i am already at heart your majesty s subject of what these letters of what use are the letters rejoined françois still in the best why they are of this use benvenuto that now that you are i can make you seigneur du grand nesle which was before messire le maçon you will add to the letters the definitive deed of the château do you benvenuto of what use the letters of naturalization are yes sire and i thank you a thousand times one would say that understood each other without words for this favor which upon me to day is a step toward a very very great favor which perhaps dare to ask at your hands some day and is so to say of it you know what i promised you benvenuto bring me my jupiter and you will yes your majesty has a good memory and i hope your word will prove as good yes your majesty you have it in your power to gratify upon which my life in a measure depends and you have already sublime instinct worthy of a king made its gratification more easy it shall be done my eminent artist according to your wish but allow us to see what you have in your hands it is a silver salt dish sire to go with the ewer and the basin show it me quickly benvenuto king scrutinized carefully and silently as always the of work which cellini handed him what a blunder he said at last what a paradox what sire cried benvenuto disappointed beyond measure is not pleased with it certainly not monsieur why you spoil a lovely idea by executing silver it must be done in gold cellini i am very sorry for you you must begin again alas sire said benvenuto sadly be not so ambitious for my the richness of the material will destroy these treasures of i greatly fear more lasting glory is to be attained by clay than in gold sire and the names of us goldsmiths survive a little while necessity is sometimes a cruel master sire and always greedy and stupid who can say that a silver cup for majesty would give ten thousand ducats might not be melted ten crowns how now do you think that the king of france will ever pawn the his table sire the emperor of constantinople pawned our saviour s crown with the venetians but a king of france took it out of pawn monsieur very true but think of the possible risks revolution and exile from a country whence the medicis have been thrice expelled recalled and it is only kings like your majesty who in themselves from whom their treasures cannot be taken away no matter benvenuto no matter i desire my salt dish in gold and will hand you to day a thousand gold crowns of the old that purpose you hear comte d orbec to day for i do not to lose a minute adieu benvenuto go on with your work does not forget his jupiter adieu messieurs think of charles v françois was descending the staircase to join the queen who in her carriage and whom he was to accompany on horseback incidents occurred which we must not omit to mention walked up to comte d orbec and said to him be good enough the gold ready for me messire le trésorier in obedience to s commands i go at once to my house for a bag and shall be office in a half hour the count bowed in token of acquiescence cellini took his departure alone after looking around in vain the same time marmagne was speaking in an undertone with the provost still held colombo s hand this is a magnificent opportunity he said and i shall go at summon my men do you tell d orbec to detain cellini as long that he disappeared and messire d estourville went to d orbec a few words in his ear after which he said aloud meanwhile count i will take colombe back to the hôtel de nesle very good said d orbec and come and let me know the result separated and the provost slowly walked away with his the hôtel de nesle followed without their knowledge by ascanio did not lose sight of them but kept his eyes fixed fondly upon the king was mounting a superb sorrel his favorite steed to him by henry viii we are to make a long journey together to day he said gentil joli petit cheval à monter doux à descendre 11 there are the first two lines of a quatrain he added

was applauded on all sides and the king already in the saddle his hand gracefully in acknowledgment of the poet s swift inspiration returned to the apartments of the queen of navarre more out than ever i don t know what the matter was with them at court to day but they were all extremely stupid footnote 8 it was at villers cotterets a small town in the department where françois i had a château that the famous signed providing that the acts of sovereign courts should be written in latin but should be drawn up in the vernacular château is still in existence although sadly shorn of magnificence and diverted from the uses for which it intended begun by françois i who carved the it it was finished by henri ii who added his that of catherine de medicis the visitor may still see

haste and procured not a bag as told comte d orbec that he should but a small wicker basket by one of his cousins a nun at florence as he was determined an end of the affair that day and it was already two o clock not wait for ascanio whom he had completely lost sight of nor who had gone to dinner but started at once for manteau where comte d orbec had his official residence he kept his eyes open he saw nothing on the way to cause least uneasiness he reached the treasurer s abode that dignitary informed him could not deliver his gold to him at once as there were formalities to be gone through with a notary to and a contract to be drawn up the count apologized with expressions of regret knowing cellini s impatient nature so courteous withal that it was impossible to be angry resigned himself to wait believing in the reality of to a speedy delivery of the gold desired to take advantage of the delay to send for some of that they might accompany him home and help him to carry d orbec quickly volunteered to send one of his servants to de nesle with the message then he led the conversation around s work and the king s evident partiality for him to short likely to incline benvenuto to be patient which was the of accomplishment as he had no reason for wishing ill to and no suspicion that the count had any reason for being him there was his desire to supplant him with colombe but no of that desire save ascanio and himself he therefore met s friendly overtures graciously enough time was necessary to select gold of the degree of the king desired him to have the notary was very slow in coming contract is not drawn up in a moment in short when after the of courtesies benvenuto made ready to return to his studio was beginning to fall he questioned the servant who was sent companions and was told that they were unable to come but that gladly carry the gold for him benvenuto s suspicions and he declined the offer courteous as it was placed the gold in his little basket then passed his arm through handles and as there was barely room for his arm the cover pressed down and he carried it much more easily than if it in a bag he had a stout coat of mail with sleeves beneath a short sword at his side and a dagger in his belt he set out homeward journey at a quick pace but cautiously nevertheless he started he noticed several servants speaking together in and that they left the house in a great hurry but they made of going in a different direction from that taken by him day when one can go from the louvre to the institute by the pont benvenuto s homeward journey would be but a stride but at it was a long walk he was obliged starting from manteau to follow the quay as far as the châtelet cross des meuniers go across the city by rue saint barthélemy cross left bank by the pont saint michel and from there go down the the grand nesle by the deserted quay the reader need not in those days of thieves and cut throats benvenuto his courage felt some anxiety touching so sum as that he carried upon his arm and if he will go forward with or three hundred yards in advance of benvenuto he will see that was not unjustifiable it began to grow dark about an hour before four men of wrapped in great cloaks stationed themselves upon the augustins at a point abreast of the church the river bank with walls only at that spot and was absolutely deserted moment while they stood there they saw no one pass but on his way back to the châtelet after escorting colombe to nesle and him they saluted with the respect due the were talking in low tones in a recess formed by the church hats were pulled well down over their eyes two of them known to us the bravos employed by vicomte de marmagne in fated expedition against the grand nesle their names were fracasso their companions who earned their livelihood at the calling were named procope and maledent in order may not quarrel over the nationality of these four as it has done for three thousand years over that of we will add that maledent was a picard procope a bohemian ferrante and fracasso first saw the light beneath the soft skies as to their distinctive callings in time of peace procope was ferrante a pedant fracasso a dreamer of dreams and maledent it will be seen that the fact that we are ourselves a not blind us to the character of the only one of these four happened to be our compatriot battle all four were demons us listen for a moment to their friendly and edifying conversation may be able to judge therefrom what manner of men they were and was impending over our good friend benvenuto at all events fracasso said ferrante we shan t be hampered to that great red faced viscount and our poor swords can leave without his crying retreat the coward and forcing us tail very true rejoined fracasso but as he leaves us all the risk of for which i thank him he ought to leave us all the profit too what right does the red haired devil reserve five hundred crowns own part i admit that the five hundred that remain make a prize a hundred and twenty five for each of us does indeed when times are hard i sometimes find it necessary a man for two crowns for two crowns holy virgin cried maledent shame that on the profession don t say such things when i am with you any one who overheard you might confound us with each other my what would you have maledent said fracasso in a melancholy tone life has its crosses and there are times when one would kill a man bit of bread it seems to me my good friends that two hundred crowns are worth just twice as much as a hundred and twenty five that after we have killed our man we refuse to settle with thief of a marmagne you forget brother rejoined procope seriously that would disregard our agreement to defraud our patron and we must be everything let us hand the viscount the five hundred crowns to sou as agreed that is my advice but distinguamus let us distinction when he has pocketed them and when he realizes that honorable men i fail to see why we shouldn t fall upon him and from him well thought of exclaimed ferrante in a judicial tone procope distinguished for uprightness of character conjoined with a mon dieu that is because i have studied law a little said but continued ferrante with the air of pedantry which was him let us not involve ourselves in too many plans at once terminum eamus let the viscount sleep in peace his turn will come florentine goldsmith is the one we have to deal with at the moment greater security it was desired that four of us should set strictly speaking one only should have done the deed and price but the concentration of capital is a social plague and much better that the money be divided among several friends let him swiftly and cleanly he is no ordinary man as fracasso have learned let us resign ourselves therefore for to attack him all four at once it cannot be long now comes attention be cool quick of foot and eye and beware of thrusts he ll be sure to try on you i know what it is ferrante said maledent disdainfully to receive cut whether with the edge or the point once on a time i made at night into a certain château in the bourbonnais on business of nature being surprised by the dawn before i had it i had no choice but to conceal myself until the no place seemed to me so appropriate for that purpose as of the château there were quantities of stands of arms there and helmets cuirasses armlets and cuisses shields i removed the upright upon which one of the suits of put myself in its place and stood there motionless upon with lowered visor this is very interesting interposed ferrante go on maledent we better employ this period of waiting to perform one exploit listening to tales of other feats of arms go on i did not know continued maledent that accursed suit of armor by the young men of the family to practise fencing upon but strapping fellows of twenty came in took down a lance and a and began to cut and thrust at my casing with all their heart my friends you may believe me or not but under all their lance and sword i never flinched i stood there as straight as if i had really been of wood and riveted to my base the young rascals were not of the first force the in due time and urged them to aim at the joints in my armor maledent my patron whom i invoked in a whisper turned aside at last that devil of a father in order to show how to carry away a visor took a lance himself and at blow uncovered my pale and terrified face i thought i was lost poor fellow said fracasso sadly how could it be otherwise fancy if you please that when they saw my colorless face they took the ghost of their great grandfather and father and sons as if the devil was at their heels need i say more i turned and did as much for my own part and you see i came out of it whole skin very good but the important thing in our trade friend maledent is not only to receive blows manfully but to deal it s a fine thing when the victim falls without a sound of my expeditions in flanders i had to rid one of my customers of his intimate friends who were travelling in company at first that i should take three comrades but i told him would undertake it alone or not at all it was agreed that i as i chose and that i should have the stipend four times that i delivered four dead bodies i knew the road they were and i awaited their coming at an inn which they must of the inn keeper had formerly belonged to the fraternity and had left his present occupation which allowed him to plunder risk but he retained some kindly sentiments for his so that i had no great difficulty in winning him over to in consideration of a tenth of the reward with we awaited our four horsemen who soon appeared around in the road and alighted in front of the inn preparatory their stomachs and resting their horses the landlord said that his stable was so small that unless they went in one at they could hardly move there and would be in each other s way first who entered was so slow about coming out that the second and went to see what he was doing he also was in no hurry whereupon the third weary of waiting followed the other two some little time as the fourth was expressing his astonishment delay mine host remarked ah i see what it is the stable is small that they have gone out through the door at the rear this explanation encouraged my last man to join his companions for you will have guessed that i was in the stable i however the satisfaction of uttering one little cry to to the world as there was no longer any danger in roman law ferrante would not that he called trucidatio necis but deuce take it added procope changing our man doesn t come god grant that nothing has happened to him will he pitch dark very soon suadentque cadentia sidera somnos added fracasso and by the way friends take care that benvenuto doesn t in the dark resort to which i once put in practice myself it was during my sojourn banks of the rhine i always loved the banks of the rhine there is so picturesque and at the same time so melancholy is the river of dreamers i was dreaming then upon the banks rhine and this was the subject of my dreams a nobleman named schreckenstein if my memory serves me was to be death it was no easy matter for he never went out without a this is the plan upon which i finally resolved i donned a costume like that worn by him and one dark evening i lay for him and his escort when i saw them coming through the darkness obscuri sub nocte i made a desperate attack who was walking a little ahead but i was clever strike off his hat with its waving plumes and then to change so that i was standing where he should have been thereupon him with a violent blow with my sword hilt and began to the clashing of swords and the shouts of the others help help to the brigands so that schreckenstein s men fell furiously master and left him dead upon the spot while i glided away bushes the worthy nobleman could at least say that he was killed friends it was a bold stroke said ferrante but if i were to cast a upon my vanished past i could find a still more audacious like you fracasso i had to deal with a chief of partisans well mounted and escorted it was in a forest in the abruzzi myself in an enormous oak tree upon a great branch out over the road at a point which the personage in pass and there i waited musing the sun was rising and its fell in long shafts of pale light down through the moss the morning air was fresh and keen enlivened by the songs suddenly sh procope interrupted him i hear footsteps attention it s good muttered maledent glancing furtively about all is silent hereabout fortune is on our side stood without speaking or moving their dark threatening not be distinguished in the gathering gloom but one might their gleaming eyes their hands playing nervously with and their attitude of breathless suspense in the half formed a striking dramatic group which no pencil but s could adequately reproduce was in fact benvenuto coming on at a rapid pace as we have said were aroused and with his piercing glance he maintained watch in the darkness as his eyes were accustomed to light he saw the four bandits issue from their ambush when still twenty yards away and had time to throw his cloak over and draw his sword before they were upon him furthermore self possession which never abandoned him he backed against wall and thus faced all of his assailants attacked him savagely he could not retreat and it was useless out as the château was five hundred yards away but benvenuto novice in deeds of arms and he received the cut throats with vigor mind remained perfectly clear and a sudden thought flashed as he plied his sword it was evident that this ambuscade against him and no other if therefore he could succeed them off the track he was saved he began therefore as rained down upon him to joke them upon their pretended mistake what fit has seized you my fine fellows are you mad what do to make out of an old soldier like me is it my cloak that does my sword tempt you stay stay you if you want my you must earn it sang dieu by my soul for thieves who seem served their apprenticeship your scent is bad my children that he charged upon them instead of falling back before them took one or two steps away from the wall and immediately back against it once more incessantly slashing and thrusting pains to throw aside his cloak several times so that if been warned by comte d orbec s servants whom he had seen leave and who had seen him count the money they would at that he had not the gold upon him indeed his assured speaking and the ease with which he handled his sword with crowns under his arm caused the bravos to entertain damnation do you suppose we have made a mistake ferrante i fear so the man seemed not so tall to me or even if it is he t the gold and that damned viscount deceived us i have gold cried benvenuto thrusting and parrying vigorously while i have no gold save a handful of gilded copper but if ambitious to secure that my children you will pay dearer for if it were gold belonging to another i promise you deuce take him said procope he s really a soldier could fence so cleverly as he expend all your wind on him if you fellows i don t light for glory procope began to heat a retreat grumbling to himself while of the others relaxed in vigor by reason of their doubts as of his absence benvenuto with no such motive for weakening the opportunity to drive them back and to start for backing before his assailants but fighting all the time himself manfully the savage boar was luring the hounds to his den come my brave fellows come with me he said bear me company as the entrance to the pré aux clercs the maison rouge where whose father sells wine is expecting me to night the t very safe so they say and i should be glad to have an escort that pleasantry fracasso also abandoned the chase and went procope we are fools ferrante said maledent this isn t your benvenuto yes yes i say it is himself cried ferrante who had at the basket bulging out with money under benvenuto s arm as sudden movement disarranged his cloak it was too late the château was within a hundred feet or less was shouting in his powerful voice hôtel de nesle ho help had barely time to retrace his steps procope to hasten up and maledent to redouble their efforts the workmen who their master were on the alert the door of the château open at his first shout and hermann the colossus little jehan le gaucher and jacques aubry came running out armed with pikes that sight the bravos turned and fled wait wait my dear young friends benvenuto shouted to the fugitives won t you escort me a little farther o the bunglers who couldn t one lone man a thousand golden crowns which tired his arm brigands had in fact succeeded in inflicting no other injury than scratch upon their opponent s hand and they made their and fracasso howling with pain poor fracasso at the lost his right eye and was one eyed for the rest of his days which accentuated the tinge of melancholy which was prominent characteristic of his pensive countenance well my children said benvenuto to his companions when of the bravos had died away in the distance we must supper after that exploit come all and drink to my escape my but god help inc i do not see ascanio among you where reader will remember that ascanio left the louvre before his master i know where he is said little jehan where is he my boy asked benvenuto down at the end of the garden where he has been walking for half the student and i went there to talk with him but he begged us him alone strange said benvenuto how did he fail to hear my shout how is he did not hasten to me with the others do not wait for me without me my children ah there you are scozzone o mon dieu what is this they tell me that some one tried to master yes yes there was something like that mon dieu cried scozzone it was nothing my dear girl nothing said benvenuto consolingly catherine had become as pale as death go now and bring wine best for these gallant fellows take the keys of the cellar ruperta scozzone and select it yourself why you are not going out again said scozzone no never fear i am going to find ascanio in the garden i matters to discuss with him and the others returned to the studio and benvenuto the gate leading to the garden moon was just rising and the master saw ascanio very plainly but of walking the young man was climbing a ladder set against between the gardens of the grand and petit nesle when he top he pulled the ladder up after him lowered it on the and disappeared passed his hand over his eyes like a man who cannot he sees forming a sudden resolution he went straight to and up into his cell stepped to the window sill and leaped wall of the petit nesle from there with the aid of a stout vine dropped noiselessly into colombe s garden it had rained in and the ground was so damp that his footfalls were deadened put his ear to the ground and questioned the silence for at last he heard subdued voices in the distance which steps he at once rose and crept cautiously forward feeling and stopping from moment to moment soon the voices became walked toward them and at last when he reached the which crossed the garden he recognized colombe or rather presence in the shadow dressed in white and sitting beside the bench we already know they were talking in low tones and with animation from their observation by a clump of trees benvenuto drew listened autumn night s was a beautiful autumn evening calm and clear the moon had almost all the clouds and the few which remained were and there over the star strewn sky around the group talking in the garden of the petit nesle everything was calm but within their hearts all was sadness and agitation my darling colombe said ascanio while benvenuto standing cold behind him seemed to be listening with his heart rather than ears my dearest love why alas did our paths meet when you that i have to tell you of misery and horror you will curse me the bearer of such news nay my dear replied colombe whatever you may have to tell me bless you for in my eyes you are as one sent by god i my mother s voice but i feel that i should have listened to i listen to you go on ascanio and if you have terrible things me your voice will at least comfort me a little summon all your courage and all your strength said ascanio he told her all that had taken place in his presence d etampes and comte d orbec he described the whole plot of treason against the kingdom and designs upon the honor innocent child he subjected himself to the agony of explaining bargain made by the treasurer to that ingenuous soul aghast revelation of wickedness he must needs to make the maiden was so pure that she did not blush at his words understand refinements of torture and ignominy which hatred and baffled to the favorite all that was perfectly clear to colombe was that her lover was filled with loathing and dismay and slender vine which has no other support than the sapling to which she trembled and shuddered with him my dear she said you must make known this fearful plot against to my father my father does not suspect our love he owes you and he will listen to you oh never fear he will rescue me clutches of comte d orbec alas was ascanio s only reply o my love cried colombe who understood all the in her lover s exclamation oh can you suspect my father in so hateful a design that would be too wicked ascanio my father knows nothing suspects nothing i am sure and has never shown me any great affection he would never with his plunge me into shame and misery forgive me colombe rejoined ascanio but your father is to see misery in increased wealth a title would conceal and in his courtier like pride he would deem you happier as s mistress than as an artist s wife it is my duty to hide you colombe comte d orbec told madame la duchesse d etampes would answer for your father just god is it possible cried the poor girl was such a thing ascanio as a father who sold his daughter such things are seen in all countries and at all times my poor angel more than ever at this time and in this country do not picture the world as fashioned after the image of your heart as taking pattern by your virtue yes colombe the of france have shamelessly farmed out the youth and beauty wives and daughters to the royal lust it is looked upon as of course at court and your father if he cares to take to justify himself will not lack illustrious precedents i to forgive me my beloved for bringing your chaste and so abruptly in contact with this hideous reality but i the necessity of showing you the snare that is laid for you ascanio ascanio cried colombe hiding her face against the s shoulder my father also turns against me oh simply to kills me with shame where can i fly for shelter where but to ascanio yes it is for you to save me now have you spoken master to benvenuto who is so strong and great and kindly by your description of him and whom i love because you nay do not love him do not love him colombe cried ascanio why not whispered the girl because he loves you because instead of the friend upon whom we could rely he is one enemy the more we have to an enemy you understand and the most formidable of all listen he told her how as he was on the point of making a benvenuto the goldsmith described to him his ideal love and the favorite sculptor of françois i by virtue of the king s honor to which he had never proved false could obtain whatever to ask after the statue of jupiter was cast as we know the benvenuto proposed to ask was colombe s hand o god we have none to look to for succor but thee said colombe her white hands and her lovely eyes to heaven all our changed to enemies every haven of refuge becomes a dangerous reef you certain that we are so utterly abandoned only too certain replied ascanio my master is as dangerous to us father colombe yes he continued wringing his hands i driven to hate him benvenuto my friend my master my father my god and yet i ask you colombe why i him ill will because he has fallen under the spell to which mind that comes in contact with yours must yield because you as i love you his crime is my own after all but you colombe and so i am absolved what shall we do for two days i asking myself the question and i do not know whether i begin him or whether i love him still he loves you it is true has loved me so dearly too that my poor heart wavers and its perplexity like a reed shaken in the wind what will he do all i shall tell him of comte d orbec s designs and i hope that deliver us from them but after that when we find ourselves face as enemies when i tell him that his pupil is his rival his will which is omnipotent as fate will perhaps be he will forget ascanio to think only of colombe he will turn away from the man he once loved to see only the woman he loves i feel myself that between him and you i should not hesitate i i would remorselessly sacrifice my heart s past for its future for heaven and why should he act differently he is a man and his love would be more than human we must therefore fight but how can i feeble and alone as i am resist him but no matter even if i should come some day to hate him i have loved so so well i tell you now that i would not for all the world to the torture he inflicted upon me the other morning when his love for you benvenuto standing like a statue behind his tree felt of icy sweat roll down his forehead and his hand at his heart poor ascanio dear heart returned colombe you have already and have much to suffer still but let us face calmly let us not exaggerate our griefs for the prospect is desperate including god there are three of us to make misfortune you would rather see me benvenuto s wife than orbec s would you not but you would also prefer to see me wedded lord than to benvenuto very well if i am not yours i will none but the lord be sure of that ascanio your wife in this world your betrothed in the other that is my promise to you ascanio promise i will keep never fear thanks thou angel from heaven thanks said ascanio let us great world around us and concentrate our lives upon this where we now are colombe you haven t told me yet that you alas it would almost seem that you are mine because you could otherwise hush ascanio hush do you not see that i am trying to sanctify by making it a duty i love you ascanio i love you could no longer find strength to stand he fell upon his his head against a tree his haggard eyes were fixed vacantly while with his ear turned toward the young people he feverish intentness dear colombe echoed ascanio i love you and something tells me shall be happy and that the lord will not abandon the loveliest his angels mon dieu mon dieu in this atmosphere of joy me i forget the circle of grief which i must enter when you we must think of to morrow said colombe let us help ourselves so that god may help us it would be disloyal i think your master benvenuto in ignorance of our love for he incur great risk in contending against madame d etampes d orbec it would not be fair you must tell him everything i will obey you dearest colombe for a word from you as you is law to me my heart also tells me that you are right but it will be a terrible blow for him alas i judge from my it is possible that his love for me may turn to hatred it that he will turn me out of doors in that case how can i without friends or shelter resist such powerful enemies duchesse d etampes and the king s treasurer who will help me the plans of that terrible couple who will fight on my side unequal struggle who will hold out a helping hand to me i said a deep grave voice behind them benvenuto cried the apprentice without even turning round shrieked and sprang to her feet ascanio gazed at his master between affection and wrath yes it is i benvenuto cellini continued the goldsmith i do not love mademoiselle i whom you no longer love ascanio come to save you both nevertheless what do you say cried ascanio i say that you must come and sit down again here by my side for understand one another you have no need to tell me aught i lost a word of your conversation forgive me for listening after upon you by chance but you understand it is much better that know all you have said some things very sad and terrible for hear but some kind things too ascanio was sometimes right wrong it is very true mademoiselle that i would you with him but since you love him that s the end of it he has forbidden you to love me but i will force you to it you to him dear master cried ascanio you suffer monsieur do you not said colombe clasping her hands ah thanks thanks said benvenuto as his eyes filled with tears his feelings with a mighty effort you see that i suffer would not have noticed it ungrateful boy but nothing escapes s eyes yes i will not tell you a falsehood i do suffer and since you are lost to me but at the same time i am happy am able to serve you you will owe everything to me and that me a little you were wrong ascanio my beatrice is jealous will brook no rival you ascanio must finish the statue of hebe my sweetest dream the last spoke with effort in a broken voice colombe toward him and put her hand in his weep my friend weep she said softly yes yes said cellini bursting into tears stood for some time without speaking weeping bitterly and emotion from head to foot his forceful nature gladly sought tears too long held back ascanio and colombe looked on in at this exhibition of bitter grief except on the day when i wounded you ascanio except at the i saw your blood flow i have not wept for twenty years he last recovering his self control but it has been a hard blow i was in such agony just now behind those trees that i was a moment to plunge my dagger in my heart and end it all the that held my hand was your need of me and so you saved my life is as it should be after all ascanio has twenty years more to give you than i have colombe and then he is my child be very happy together and it will rejoice my father s heart will succeed in triumphing over benvenuto himself as well his enemies it is the lot of us creators to suffer and one of my tears will cause some lovely statue to spring up as dante s tears became a sublime strain you see colombe i am to my old love my cherished sculpture that love will me you did well to bid me weep all the bitterness has from my heart by my tears i am sad still but i am kind and i will forget my pain in my efforts to save you took one of the master s hands and pressed it warmly in colombe took the other and put it to her lips benvenuto heavily than he had yet done shaking his head he said with do not make it harder for me but spare me my children it will never to speak of this again henceforth colombe i will be nothing more i will be your father the rest is all a dream let us talk of the danger which threatens you and of what we are i overheard you a moment since discussing your plans mon dieu very young and neither of you has an idea of what life really is offer yourselves in the innocence of your heart to the cruel destiny unarmed and you hope to vanquish malignity avarice vile passions of which man is capable with your kind hearts and dear fools i will be strong and cunning and implacable in i am wonted to it but you god created you for happiness my lovely cherubs and i will see to it that you destiny ascanio anger shall not furrow thy calm brow grief colombe disturb the pure outlines of thy face i will take you in my arms eyed charming pair i will bear you so through all the mire of life and will not set you down until you have arrived sound at perfect joy and then i ll gaze at you and be happy happiness but you must have blind confidence in me i have my ways abrupt and hard to understand and which may you a little colombe i conduct myself somewhat after the artillery and i go straight to my goal heedless of what i may the road yes i think more of the purity of my intentions than of the morality of the means i use when i set a beautiful figure i care but little whether the clay soils the figure finished i wash my hands and that s the end of it you then mademoiselle with your refined and timorous heart to answer to god for my acts he and i understand each other i powerful combination to deal with the count is ambitious the and the duchess very subtle they are each and all you are in their power and in their hands and two of rights over you it may perhaps be necessary to resort to craft i shall arrange it however so that you and ascanio will part in a contest in every way beneath you come colombe are to close your eyes and allow yourself to be led when i say will you do it remain there will you remain go will what does ascanio say asked colombe colombe returned the apprentice benvenuto is great and good us and forgives the injury we have done him let us obey him you command me master said colombe and i will obey you as if you by god himself very well my child i have but one thing more to ask you it will dear perhaps but you must make up your mind to it thereafter will be confined to waiting and allowing circumstances and do our work in order that both of you may have more perfect faith and that you may confide unhesitatingly in one whose life may not but whose heart has remained pure i am about to tell you of my youth all stories resemble one another alas and at the heart of every one ascanio i propose to tell you how the angel of whom i have spoken to you came to be my existence you shall know who she was and you will wonder doubt at my determination to abandon colombe to you when you by that sacrifice i am but beginning to pay to the child the debt the mother your mother a saint in paradise ascanio say blessed stefana would say crowned you have always told me master that you would tell me your some day yes and the moment has come to redeem my promise you will have confidence in me colombe when you know all the reasons i have our ascanio benvenuto took a hand of each of his children in his own them what follows in his grave melodious voice beneath stars in the peaceful silence of the night twenty years since i was twenty years old as you are now ascanio i was at work with a florentine goldsmith named raphael del moro a good workman and did not lack taste but he cared more for for work allowing himself to be inveigled into attending disheartening facility and although he had little money astray those who were in his studio very often i was left the house singing over some piece of work i had in hand in i sang as scozzone does all the sluggards in the city came as of course to master raphael for employment or rather in quest for he had the reputation of being too weak ever to quarrel grows rich slowly with such habits as his so he was always hard up soon came to be the most discredited goldsmith in florence i am wrong he had a confrère who had even less custom than he he was of a noble family but it was not for irregularity his obligations that gismondo gaddi was cried down but for lack of talent and his sordid avarice as everything him left his hands imperfect or spoiled and not a customer happened to be a stranger ventured into his shop gismondo earn his living by usury and to loan money at enormous interest men desirous of discounting their future prospects succeeded better than the other as gaddi always security and went into nothing without reliable guaranties exception he was as he himself said very considerate suffering he loaned to everybody compatriots and foreigners christians he would have loaned to st peter upon the keys or to satan upon his estates in hell need i say that he loaned to my poor raphael del moro who day his provision for the morrow but whose sterling wavered their constant connection in business and the to which both were subjected tended to bring the together del moro was deeply grateful for his confrère amiability in the matter of advancing money gaddi an honest and accommodating debtor they were in a word friends in the world and gismondo would not have missed for one of the parties with which del moro regaled him del moro was a widower but he had a daughter of sixteen from a sculptor s point of view stefana was not beautiful her appearance was most striking beneath her forehead which too high and not smooth enough for a woman one could see at work so to speak her great moist eyes of a velvety moved you to respect and deep emotion as they rested upon you pallor overspread her face which was lightened by a charming expression like the faint sunshine of an autumn morning a crown of luxurious raven locks and hands a queen might stefana ordinarily stood bending slightly forward like a lily the wind you might at times have taken her for a statue when she stood erect when her lovely eyes sparkled nostrils dilated when her arm was outstretched to emphasize you would have adored her as the archangel gabriel you ascanio but you have less weakness of resolution for suffering the immortality of the soul was never revealed to my eyes than in that slender graceful body who feared his daughter almost as much as he loved her to say that he had consigned to the tomb only the body of that stefana was her dead mother s soul i was at this time an adventurous youth an impulsive giddy i loved liberty before everything i was bubbling over and i expended my surplus energy in foolish quarrels and affairs i worked nevertheless with no less passion than i put pleasures and despite my vagaries i was raphael s best workman only one in the establishment who earned any money but what i i did by instinct almost by chance i had studied the ancients purpose for whole days i had gazed upon the bas reliefs of athens and rome making studies with pencil and chisel contact with these sublime artists of former days gave and precision of outline but i was simply a successful imitator did not create still i say again i was incontestably and easily and most hardworking of del moro s comrades i have that the master s secret wish was that i should marry but i was thinking little of settling down i faith i was enamored freedom from care and an outdoor life i was absent workshop whole days at a time i would return completely fatigue and yet in a few hours i would have overtaken and s other workmen i would fight for a word fall in love at a fine husband i should have made moreover my feelings when i was with stefana in no wise aroused by the pretty girls of porta del prato or borgo pinti overawed me if i had been told that i loved her otherwise an elder sister i should have laughed when i returned from one of i dared not look stefana in the face she was more than stern was sad on the other hand when fatigue or a praiseworthy had detained me at home i always sought stefana her sweet face and her sweet voice my affection for in it something serious and sacred which i did not at the understand but which was very pleasant to me very often amid excesses the thought of stefana would pass through my mind companions would ask me why i had suddenly become thoughtful when i was in the act of drawing my sword or my dagger pronounce her name as it were that of my patron saint and that whenever that occurred i retired from the contest unhurt this tender feeling for the dear child innocent lovely as she was lay dormant at the bottom of my heart as in for her part it is certain that she was as full of indulgence feeling for me as she was cold and dignified with my she sometimes came to sit in the studio beside her father would sometimes feel her eyes fixed on my face as she bent over i was proud and happy in her preference although i did my feeling to myself if one of my comrades indulged in a flattery and informed me that my master s daughter was in me i received his insolence so wrathfully that he never an accident which befell stefana proved to me how deeply she had in my heart one day when she was in the studio looking at a piece of work she take away her little white hand quickly enough and a who was tipsy i think struck the little finger and the it with his chisel the poor child shrieked at first then as of it smiled to reassure us but her hand as she held it up with blood i think i should have killed the fellow had my been concentrated upon her gismondo gaddi who was present said that he knew a surgeon in and ran to fetch him the villanous medicaster dressed and came every day to see stefana but he was so ignorant that gangrene set in thereupon the ass pompously despite his efforts stefana s right arm would always raphael del moro was in too straitened circumstances to be able another physician but when i heard the imbecile announce i refused to abide by it i hurried to my room emptied which contained all my savings and ran off to giacomo rastelli the pope s surgeon and the most eminent practitioner in at my earnest entreaty and as the sum i offered him was by contemptible he came at once exclaiming o these lovers the wound he announced that he would answer for it would be able to use the right arm as well as the other within i longed to embrace the worthy man he set about dressing maimed lingers and stefana was at once relieved but a day or it was necessary to remove the decayed bone she asked me to be present at the operation to give her courage i was entirely lacking in it myself and my heart felt in my breast master giacomo made use of some great caused stefana terrible pain she could not restrain her groans echoed in my heart my temples were bathed in a cold perspiration at last the torture exceeded my strength the cruel tool which poor delicate fingers tortured me no less i rose begging to suspend the operation and to wait for me a quarter of i went down to the studio and there as if inspired by my good genius made an instrument of thin sharp steel which would cut like a razor returned to the surgeon who with that operated so gently and the dear girl felt almost no pain in five minutes it was all over a fortnight later she gave me the hand to kiss which as she said had preserved but it would be impossible for me to describe the poignant emotion through when i saw the suffering of my poor résignée as called her resignation was in truth the natural condition of her mind not happy her father s improvidence and recklessness distressed measure her only consolation was religion like all she was pious very often as i entered some church to pray for always loved god i would spy stefana in a corner weeping whenever as too frequently happened master del moro s left her penniless she would appeal to me with a simple confidence which went to my heart she would say dear girl the simplicity characteristic of noble hearts benvenuto i to pass the night at work to finish that reliquary or that ewer we have no money at all i soon adopted the habit of submitting to her every piece of work completed and she would point out its imperfections and advise extraordinary sagacity solitude and sorrow had inspired her mind more than one would think possible her words at once innocent and profound taught me more than one secret of and often opened new possibilities to my mind i remember one day when i showed her a medal which i was engraving cardinal and which had a representation of the cardinal s head on and on the other jesus walking on the sea and holding out to st peter with this legend quare dubitasti thou doubt stefana was well pleased with the portrait which was a very and very well executed she looked at the reverse in a long while the face of our lord is very beautiful she said at last and if intended for apollo or jupiter i should find nothing to criticise jesus is something more than beautiful jesus is divine the this face are superb in their purity but where is the soul i man but i look in vain for the god consider benvenuto that not an artist simply but a christian as well my heart you know often bled that is to say alas my heart has often doubted and i have shaken off my depression when i saw jesus holding out his me and have heard the sublime words wherefore hast thou doubted benvenuto your image of him is less beautiful than he in countenance there was the sadness of the afflicted father clemency of the king who pardons his forehead shone but his he was more than great he was good wait a moment stefana said i i effaced what i had done and in a few moments i once more began savior s face under her eyes is that better i asked as i handed it to her oh yes she replied with tears in her eyes so our blessed to me when i was heavy hearted yes i recognize him now by of compassion and majesty ah benvenuto i advise you to follow this course before taking the wax in hand be the thought you possess the instrument master the expression the material part seek the spiritual part let your fingers aught but the servants of your mind such was the counsel given me by that child of sixteen in her sense when i was alone i reflected upon what she had said to me realized that she was right thus did she guide and enlighten having the form in my mind i sought the idea and to form and the idea in such wise that they would issue from my hands blended whole as minerva came forth all armed from the jupiter mon dieu how lovely is youth and how its memories do overpower one colombe this lovely evening we are passing together reminds all those i passed by stefana s side sitting upon a bench outside s house she would gaze up at the sky and i would gaze at her was twenty years ago but it seems only yesterday i put out my fancy that i can feel hers but it is yours my children what is well done oh simply to see her in her white dress was to feel tranquillity my soul often when we parted we had not uttered a word and yet away from those silent interviews all sorts of fine and which made me better and greater but all this had an end as all happiness in this world has raphael del moro had but little farther to go to reach the of destitution he owed his kind neighbor gismondo gaddi ducats which he knew not how to pay the thought drove man to desperation he wished at least to save his daughter his purpose to give her to me to one of the workmen he might broach the subject to me but he was one of the i had lost my temper with when they threw stefana s at my head as a reproach the blockhead did not even to finish abandon that scheme master del moro he said the suggestion be favorably received my word for it the goldsmith was proud he believed that i despised him on account poverty and he never referred to the subject again some time after gismondo gaddi came to demand payment of his debt raphael asked for more time hark ye said gismondo give me your daughter s hand and i you a receipt in full del moro was transported with joy to be sure gaddi had the being a little covetous a little high tempered and a but he was rich and what the poor esteem and envy most alas wealth when raphael mentioned this unexpected proposition to she made no reply but that evening as we left the we had been sitting together to return to the house she said benvenuto gismondo gaddi has asked my hand in marriage and has given his consent with those simple words she left me i leaped to my feet and in a frenzy i went out of the city and wandered about over the fields the night now running like a madman and again lying at upon the grass and weeping a myriad of mad desperate chased one another through my disordered brain she stefana the wife of that odious gismondo i said to myself i had in some degree recovered my self control and was seeking my wits the thought overpowers me and terrifies me as well as she would certainly prefer me she makes a mute appeal to to my jealousy ah yes i am jealous furiously jealous have i the right to be gaddi is morose and violent tempered us be just to one another what woman would be happy with me am brutal capricious restless forever involved in dangerous unholy intrigues could i conquer myself no never so long as boils in my veins as at present i shall always have my hand on and my foot outside the house poor stefana i should make her weep and suffer i should see her and pine away i should hate myself and should soon come to as well as a living reproach she would die and i should have to answer for no i am not made alas i feel that i am not peaceful family joys i must have liberty space conflict rather than the peace and monotony of happiness i should my grasp that fragile delicate flower i should torture that dear heart by my insults and my own existence my own heart would by remorse but would she be happier with this gismondo gaddi should she marry him we were so happy together after all know that an artist s instincts and temperament do not themselves to the rigid bonds the commonplace family life i must say farewell to all my dreams of glory thought of making my name famous and abandon art which thrives and power how can one create when held a prisoner at fireside say o dante alighieri o michel angelo my master you would laugh to see your pupil rocking his children to sleep his wife s pardon no i will be brave in my own behalf to stefana sad and alone i will dream out my dream and destiny you see my children that i make myself no better than i am there selfishness in my decision but there was also much deep affection for stefana and my raving seemed to border closely sense the next morning i returned to the workshop in a reasonably of mind stefana also seemed calm but she was paler than usual passed thus one evening stefana said as we parted in a week benvenuto i shall be gismondo gaddi s wife as she did not leave me at once i had time to look at her she her hand on her heart bending beneath her burden of sorrow sweet smile was sad enough to make one weep she gazed at me with expression but without the least indication of reproach to me as if my angel ready to leave earth behind was to me she stood thus mute and motionless for a moment the house i was destined never to see her more in this world this time again i left the city bareheaded and running like a madman i did not return the next day or the next i kept on until rome i remained at rome five years i laid the foundation of my reputation won the friendship of the rope i had duels and love affairs success but i was not contented something was lacking engrossing occupations i never passed a day without turning my florence there was no night when i did not see in my pale faced and sad standing in the doorway of her father and gazing at me after five years i received a letter from florence sealed with black read and reread it so many times that i know it now by heart it ran thus benvenuto i am dying benvenuto i loved you listen to the dreams i dreamed i knew you as well as i knew myself the power that is in you and that will make you great some day genius which i read upon your broad forehead in your and your passionate gestures would impose grave duties on should bear your name i was ready to undertake them happiness me the solemnity of a divine mission i would not have been benvenuto i would have been your friend your sister your noble existence belongs to all mankind i know and i assumed no other right than that of diverting you in your ennui you in your moments of depression you would have been free friend always and everywhere alas i had long since to your lamentable absences from home to all the your impulsive nature to all the whims of your tempest loving heart powerful temperament has pressing needs the longer the eagle aloft the longer he is obliged to rest on earth but when torn yourself free from the feverish dreams of your genius i found once more at the awakening my sublime benvenuto whom i dearly and who would have belonged to me alone i would never you for the hours of neglect for they would have insult for me for my own part knowing you to be jealous as noble heart jealous as the god of holy writ i would in seclusion when you were away in the solitude which i love your return and praying for you such would my life have been but when i saw that you abandoned me i bowed submissively to god and yours closed my eyes and placed my fate in the hands of duty father ordered me to enter into a marriage which would save him and i obeyed my husband has been harsh stern pitiless not been content with my docile submission but demanded a my power to give and punished me brutally for my i resigned myself to endure everything i have been i trust and dignified spouse but always very sad at heart benvenuto rewarded me however even in this world by giving me a son s kisses have for four years past prevented me from blows and last of all poverty for my husband ruined to gain too much and he died last month from chagrin at may god forgive him as i do i shall be dead myself within the hour dead from the effects of suffering and i bequeath my son to you benvenuto perhaps all is for the best who can say if my womanly weakness been equal to the task i would have undertaken with you he he is like me will be a stronger and more for you he will love you better if not more dearly i am of him do for my child what i would have done for you adieu my friend i loved you and i love you still and i tell shame or remorse at the very doors of eternity for my love adieu be great and i shall be happy raise your eyes heaven that i may see you your stefana now colombe and ascanio will you have confidence in me and are to do what i advise young people replied with a single exclamation the day following that on which this story was told in the garden petit nesle by the moon s pale light benvenuto s studio wore aspect the master was working at the gold salt dish for which he had so valiantly defended against the four bravos strove to take it from him and his life with it ascanio madame d etampes s lily jacques aubry reclining lazily on chair was putting question after question to cellini who attention to him and imposed upon the inquisitive student of framing his own replies pagolo was gazing at catherine was busy with some woman s work hermann and the others were filing chiselling and scozzone s joyous singing furnished the cheerfulness in this tranquil busy scene petit nesle was by no means so tranquil for colombe all was excitement and apprehension they were seeking and calling her name dame perrine was shrieking at the her voice and the provost who had been sent for in hot haste to lay hold upon something in the midst of the good woman which might put him on the track of the absent one in all probability a fugitive look you dame perrine do you say that you last saw her a few i went away last night demanded the provost alas yes messire jésus dieu what a misfortune the poor seemed a bit cast down as she went to take off all her fixings she put on a simple white dress saints in paradise on us and then she said to me dame perrine it s a and i will go and take a turn or two in my path it might about seven o clock madame here added perrine pointing the woman who had been installed as her assistant madame here had already gone to her room doubtless to those lovely dresses which she makes so well and i was at in the room below i don t know how long i remained there it that after a while my poor tired eyes closed in spite of me that i lost myself a moment as usual interposed pulchérie sharply at all events continued dame perrine not deigning to reply to slander about ten o clock i left my chair and went to to see if colombe had not forgotten herself i called and one i supposed then that she had gone to her own room and to disturbing me as the dear child has done a thousand times heaven who would have thought ah messire le prévôt i say that she followed no lover but some ravisher i reared the way and this morning the provost broke in impatiently this morning this morning when i found that she didn t come down holy virgin to the devil with your litanies cried messire d estourville you have to say simply and without all these jeremiads ah monsieur le prévôt you can t prevent my weeping until she this morning messire being alarmed at not seeing her she so early i knocked at her door to wake her and as she did i opened the door no one the bed was not even rumpled with that i called and cried and lost my head and you want to weep dame perrine said the provost sternly have you admitted any during my absence i admit any one the idea rejoined the governess with of stupefaction feeling a little conscience stricken in didn t you forbid me messire since when pray have myself to disobey your orders admit some one oh yes this benvenuto for instance who had the assurance to deem my fair has he never tried to buy you good lack he would have been more likely to try to fly to the moon have received him prettily i promise you i am to understand then that you have never admitted a man a to the petit nesle a young man merciful heaven a young man why not the devil himself pray who is the handsome boy said pulchérie who has knocked at at least ten times since i have been here and in whose face

buckles to repair but he that apprentice wear glasses my love these walls and pavements speak if they ever saw him here enough interposed the provost severely if you have betrayed dame perrine i swear that you shall pay me for it i now to this benvenuto god knows how the clown will receive me go i must to his expectation benvenuto received the provost with in the face of his cool and easy manner and his good humor d estourville did not dare mention his suspicions but he his daughter having been unnecessarily alarmed the evening before fled in her panic terror like a mad girl that it was possible might have taken refuge in the grand nesle without benvenuto or else that she might have fainted somewhere in the she was passing through in short he lied in the most bungling cellini courteously accepted all his fables and all his excuses he was so obliging as to appear to notice nothing out of he did more he sympathized with the provost with all his heart that he would be happy to assist in restoring his daughter father who had always hedged her around with such touching affection hear him one might suppose the fugitive was very much in the wrong could not too soon return to so pleasant a home and so loving moreover to prove the sincerity of his interest in estourville s affliction he placed himself at his disposal to in his search in the grand nesle and elsewhere provost half convinced and the more deeply affected by in that he knew in his heart that he did not deserve them a careful search of his former property of which he knew all and outs there was not a door that he did not open not a a chest into which he did not peer as if by inadvertence every nook and corner of the hotel itself he went into and searched the arsenal foundry stables and cellar everything most rigorously benvenuto faithful to offer accompanied him throughout his investigations and to the utmost of his ability offering him all the keys and attention to this or that corridor or closet which the he advised him to leave one of his people on guard in as he left it lest the fugitive should evade him by stealing to place continued his perquisitions for two hours to no purpose estourville feeling sure that he had omitted nothing and his host s politeness left the grand nesle with profuse thanks to its master whenever it suits your pleasure to return said the goldsmith and desire to renew your investigations here my house is open to you times as when it was your own indeed it is your right messire we not sign a treaty whereby we agreed to live on neighborly terms provost thanked benvenuto and as he knew not how to return he loudly praised as he went away the colossal statue which the artist was at work upon as we have said benvenuto around it and complacently called his attention to its it was more than sixty feet high and nearly twenty at its base d estourville withdrew much dejected as he had failed to daughter in the precincts of the grand nesle he was convinced had found shelter somewhere in the city but even at that time was sufficiently large to make his own task as chief officer of an embarrassing one then too there was this question to had she been kidnapped or had she fled was she the victim other person s violence or had she yielded to her own impulse was nothing to set at rest his uncertainty upon this point that in the first event she would succeed in escaping and in would return of her own volition he therefore waited with he could muster none the less questioning dame perrine a day who passed her time calling upon the saints in paradise swearing by all the gods that she had admitted no one and was no more suspicious than messire d estourville himself day and the next passed without news the provost thereupon put agents in the field a thing he had hitherto omitted to do in the unfortunate occurrence in which his reputation was so might not be noised abroad to be sure he simply gave s description without giving them her name and were made upon an entirely different pretext from one but although he resorted to all his secret sources all their searching was without result he had never been an affectionate or gentle father but if he in despair he was in a bad temper and his pride suffered if did not he thought indignantly of the fine match which the would perhaps miss by reason of this escapade and with of the witticisms and sarcasms with which his misadventure would at court had to make up his mind at last to confide his woful tale to orbec colombe s fiancé was grieved by the news in the same way merchant is grieved who learns that part of his cargo has and not otherwise he was a philosopher was the dear count promised his worthy friend that if the affair did not make too the marriage should come off none the less and as he was a knew how to strike when the iron was hot he seized the whisper to the provost a few words as to the plans of etampes regarding colombe provost was dazzled at the honor which might be in store for him anger redoubled and he cursed the ungrateful girl who was own chances of such a noble destiny we spare our readers of the conversation between the two old courtiers to which of comte d orbec led we will say simply that grief and hope therein in a curiously touching way as misfortune brings the prospective father in law and son in law parted united than ever and without making up their minds to brilliant prospects of which they had caught a glimpse agreed to keep the occurrence secret from everybody but d etampes was too intimate a friend and too deeply an accomplice not to be let into their confidence it was a on their part for she took the thing much more to heart than and husband had done and as we know she was better any other to give the provost information and direct his search knew of ascanio s love for colombe and she had herself forced him to speak to listen to the whole conspiracy the young man a blow was to be aimed at the honor of his beloved had upon some desperate act but ascanio had himself told her did not love him and not loving him she would be unlikely herself to such a design now the duchesse d etampes knew him her suspicion first fell sufficiently well to be sure that he have the courage to defy his mistress s scorn and her resistance yet despite all her reasoning and although in her eyes all pointed to ascanio s innocence her jealous instinct that colombe must be sought at the hôtel de nesle and that make sure of ascanio before everything on the other hand madame d etampes could not tell her friends of that conviction for she must in that case confess her ascanio and that in the imprudence of her passion she had to him all her designs upon colombe she simply said to them would be very much mistaken if benvenuto were not the culprit his accomplice and the grand nesle the place of concealment purpose did the provost argue with her and swear that he and searched every corner she would not yield her point that she had her reasons for the faith that was in her and so obstinate in her opinion that she ended by arousing suspicion mind of messire d estourville who was certain nevertheless that made a thorough search however said the duchess i will send for ascanio i will see question him myself never fear o madame you are too kind said the provost and you too stupid muttered the duchess between her teeth them and set about reflecting upon the method she to induce the young man to come to her but before she had any ascanio was announced it was as if he had anticipated was cold and calm the gaze with which madame d etampes received so piercing that you would have said she wished to read to the of his heart but ascanio did not seem to notice it madame said he as he saluted her i have come to show you which is almost finished almost nothing is lacking to complete the two hundred thousand crown dewdrop you promised to furnish me very well and your colombe was the only reply vouchsafed by etampes if you mean mademoiselle d estourville madame rejoined i will beg you on my knees not to pronounce her name me yes madame i most humbly and earnestly implore you subject may never be mentioned between us in pity s name aha spite said the duchess who did not remove her penetrating ascanio s face for an instant whatever the feeling which influences me madame and though i were disgraced in your eyes i shall venture to decline hereafter to you upon this subject i have sworn a solemn oath that with that memory shall be dead and buried in my heart am i mistaken thought the duchess and has ascanio no part in can it be that the child has followed some other adorer or perforce and although lost to my ambitious schemes the interests of my passion by her flight indulged in these reflections beneath her breath she continued ascanio you beg me not to speak of her again but you will at me to speak of yourself you see that in obedience to i do not insist but who knows if this second subject will even more disagreeable to you than the first who knows forgive me for interrupting you madame said the young man but in granting me the favor i ask emboldens me to ask another of noble birth i am simply a poor obscure youth reared gloom of a goldsmith s workshop and from that artistic cloister suddenly transported to a brilliant sphere involved in the empires and weak creature that i am having powerful noblemen and a king for rival and such a king madame françois i of the most powerful princes in christendom i have suddenly elbow to elbow with the most illustrious names of the age i hopelessly i have been honored with a love i could not return with whose love great god yours madame one of the loveliest women on earth all this has sown confusion within me it has bewildered and crushed me madame i am as terrified as a dwarf awaking to find himself among giants t an idea in its place not a feeling which i can explain i among all these terrible animosities all these all these soaring ambitions madame give me time to breathe conjure you permit the poor shipwrecked wretch to collect the convalescent to recover his strength time i hope order in my mind and my life time madame give me time and s name see in me to day only the artist who comes to ask if is to your taste duchess stared at ascanio in doubt and amazement she had that this young man this child was capable of speaking grave stern poetic fashion she felt morally constrained to and confined her conversation to the lily praising and and promising to do her utmost to send him very soon the to complete his work ascanio thanked her and took his every mark of gratitude and respect can that be ascanio said madame d etampes to herself when he he seems ten years older what gives him this almost is it suffering is it happiness is he sincere in short under the influence of that accursed benvenuto is he playing with the talent of a consummate artist or is he simply own nature was perplexed the strange vertigo which gradually overpowered who contended with benvenuto cellini began to steal over her her strength of mind she set spies upon ascanio who on the rare occasions when he left the studio but that step led result at last she sent for the provost and comte d orbec them as another would have ordered to make a second domiciliary visit to the grand nesle followed her advice but although surprised at his work them even more cordially than he received the provost alone former occasion one would have said so courteous and expansive that their presence implied no suspicions that were insulting he told comte d orbec good humoredly of the ambush that he as he left his house with his golden burden a few days before same day he observed on which mademoiselle d this time as before he offered to accompany his the château and to assist the provost in recovering as a father whose sacred duties he understood so well he happy that he happened to be at home to do honor to his guests was to start that same day within two hours for romorantin named by françois i in his condescension as one of the were to go to meet the emperor events in the world of politics had moved on as rapidly as those humble narrative charles v emboldened by his rival s and by the secret undertaking of madame d etampes was few day s journey of paris a deputation had been selected to go receive him and d orbec and the provost found cellini in if he leaves paris with the rest of the escort d orbec whispered provost in all probability he didn t carry off colombe and no business here i told you so before we came retorted the provost they decided to go through with their perquisition and it with painstaking minuteness benvenuto accompanied them but as he saw that their investigations were likely to be he asked their permission to leave them and return to to give some orders to his workmen as he was to take his soon and desired to find the preparations for casting his at his return did in fact return to the studio and distributed the work among bidding them obey ascanio as if he were himself he then said a in italian in ascanio s ear bade them all adieu and prepared his departure a horse all saddled and held by little jehan him in the outer courtyard that moment scozzone went up to benvenuto and took him aside do you know master she said with a sober face that your me in a very difficult position how so my child pagolo is becoming fonder of me all the time ah is it so and he is forever talking to me about his love what do you reply dame as you bade me master i say that i will see and that may be arranged very well how is it very well you don t understand benvenuto that he that i say to him most seriously and that i may be a real engagement with him it s a fortnight since you laid down of conduct for me to adopt is it not yes i think so i hardly remember but i have a better memory than you during the first five days by reasoning gently with him i told him he must try to passion and love me no more the next five days i listened and that was a very compromising kind of an answer but me do it so i did it since then i have been driven to talk of to you and yesterday master i reached a point where i to be generous while he pressed me to confess my love for him if that is so it puts a different face on the matter said benvenuto ah at last said scozzone yes now listen little one during the first three days of my absence will let him think that you love him during the next three confess your love what you bid me do that benvenuto cried scozzone deeply wounded master s too great confidence in her never you fear what have you to reproach yourself for when i to do it mon dieu nothing i know said scozzone but being placed as i your indifference and his love i may end by falling in him outright nonsense in six days aren t you strong enough to remain him six days yes indeed i give you six days but don t remain away seven i no fear my child i will return in time adieu scozzone adieu master returned scozzone sulking smiling and weeping all cellini was giving catherine these instructions the provost orbec returned to the studio they were left to themselves with unrestricted freedom they went about their search in a sort of frenzy the garrets and cellars sounded all the walls moved all they detained all the servants they met and displayed of creditors with the patience of hunters a hundred times their steps examining the same thing again and again like s officer with a writ to serve and when they had finished flushed and excited but had discovered nothing well messieurs said benvenuto preparing to mount his horse nothing eh so much the worse so much the worse i a painful thing it must be for turn sensitive hearts like yours notwithstanding my sympathy with your suffering and my desire in your search i must begone if you feel called upon to grand nesle in my absence do not hesitate but make at home here i have given orders that the house be open at all times my only consolation for leaving you in so anxious of mind is the hope that i shall learn upon my return that found your daughter monsieur le prévôt and you your fiancée monsieur d orbec adieu messieurs he turned to his companions who were standing in a group door all save ascanio who doubtless did not care to stand faee with his rival adieu my children he said if during my absence monsieur desires to inspect my house a third time do not forget him as its former master that little jehan threw open the door and benvenuto galloped away you see that we are idiots my dear fellow said comte d orbec to when a man has kidnapped a girl he doesn t go off with the court the fifth at was not without grave doubts and a terrible sinking at the heart v stepped foot upon french territory where earth and air were to speak his enemies whose king he had treated unworthily when a prisoner in his hands and whose dauphin he had he was at least accused of it europe anticipated on the part of françois i from the moment that his himself in his power but charles s audacity great gambler that he was would not permit him to draw back and as soon had skilfully felt the ground and paved the way he boldly pyrenees counted upon finding devoted friends at the french court and he could safely trust to three guaranties the ambition of etampes the overweening conceit of the connétable anne and the king s chivalrous nature have seen how and for what reason the duchess chose to serve with the constable it was a different matter the block in the way of statesmen of all lands and all periods question of alliances politics which in this matter and is perforce conjectural only is often mistaken alas like of medicine in studying the symptoms of affinities and in risking remedies for their animosities now was a monomaniac on the subject of the spanish alliance got it into his head that france s salvation lay in that direction provided that he could satisfy charles v who had been at war master twenty years out of twenty five he cared but little how displeased his other allies the turks and the protestants or the most magnificent opportunities like that which gave françois i king had blind confidence in montmorency in truth the constable the last war against the emperor displayed a hitherto unheard and had checked the enemy s advance to be sure he did it cost of the ruin of a province by laying the country waste by devastating a tenth part of france but what the king was his minister s haughty roughness of manner obstinacy which to a superficial mind might seem unswerving firmness of resolution the result was that to the great suborner of men as brantôme calls him with equal to the fear inspired in his inferiors by this of paternosters who alternated his prayers with hangings v could therefore safely rely upon the persevering the constable placed even more reliance upon his rival s generosity indeed i carried magnanimity to an absurd point my kingdom he said has no toll house like a bridge and i do my hospitality the astute charles knew that he could trust of the knightly king when the emperor was fairly upon french territory not overcome his apprehension and his doubts he found the king sons awaiting him at the frontier and throughout his journey him with attentions and honors but the crafty as he thought that all this appearance of cordiality some deep laid snare i must say that i sleep very ill he said in a foreign country brought an anxious preoccupied face to the fêtes which were and as he advanced farther and farther toward the heart of he became more and more sad and gloomy he rode into a city he would ask himself amid all as he passed beneath the triumphal arches if that was where he was to be imprisoned then he would murmur beneath not this or any other city but all france is my dungeon assiduous courtiers are my jailers and each hour as it something to the apprehension of this tiger who believed be in a cage and saw bars on all sides day as they were riding along charles d orléans a fascinating child who was in great haste to be amiable and gallant son of france before dying of the plague like any peasant to the saddle behind the emperor and threw his arms about crying gleefully now you are my prisoner charles became death and nearly fainted châtellerault the poor imaginary captive was met by françois him fraternally and on the following day presented the to him the valorous magnificent nobility the glory of and the artists and men of letters the glory of the king and merry makings began in good earnest the emperor wore a everywhere but in his heart he was afraid and himself for his imprudence from time to time as if to liberty he would go out at daybreak from the château where he at night and he was delighted to see that his movements were with outside of the honors paid him but could he be he was not watched from a distance sometimes as if from he changed the itinerary arranged for his journey to of françois i because part of the ceremonial prescribed went for naught as a consequence he was within two day s ride of paris he remembered with terror king s sojourn at madrid for an emperor the capital would be the most honorable place of detention and at the same time he therefore begged the king to escort him at once of which he had heard so much this overturned all s plans but he was too hospitable to allow his appear and at once sent word to the queen and all the ladies to fontainebleau presence of his sister eleanora and her confidence in her husband faith allayed the emperor s anxiety to some extent but for the moment charles v was never able to feel at his he was within the dominions of the king of france françois mirror of the past charles the type of the future the sovereign times never rightly understood the hero of the middle ages impossible that there should be any real sympathy between the the chevaliers and the first of the diplomatists is true louis xi might strictly speaking lay claim to this but in our opinion louis xi was not so much the as the grasping miser the day of the emperor s arrival there was a hunting party in of fontainebleau hunting was a favorite pastime of françois i was not much better than a terrible bore to charles v seized with avidity this further opportunity to see if he was not he let the hunt pass took a by road and rode about at he was lost but when he found that he was entirely alone in of the forest as free as the air that blew through the branches as the birds that flew through the air he was almost and began to recover his good humor in some measure and anxious expression returned to his faee when upon his making at the rendezvous françois came to him flushed with of the chase and still holding in his hand the spear the warrior of marignano and pavia was much in evidence king s pleasures come my dear brother let us enjoy ourselves said françois arm through charles s in a friendly way when they had both the palace gate and leading him to the galerie de diane with the paintings of rosso and primaticcio vrai dieu as thoughtful as i was at madrid but you will agree my that i had some reason for being so for i was your prisoner you are my guest you are free you are on the eve of a triumph therefore with us if not because of the fêtes which beneath the notice of a great politician like yourself in the thought that you are on your way to humble all drinking flemings who presume to talk of renewing the communes better still forget the rebels and think only of enjoying friends does not my court impress you pleasantly it is superb my brother said charles and i envy you i too have you have seen it but a stern joyless court a gloomy statesmen and generals like lannoy peschiara and antonio de leyra you have beside your warriors and statesmen beside and dubellays beside your scholars beside budée and lascaris beside all these you have your poets and marot jean goujon primaticcio benvenuto and above all adorable women marguerite de navarre diane de poitiers de medicis and so many others and verily i begin to believe dear brother that i would willingly exchange my gold mines for strewn fields ah but you have not yet seen the fairest of all these lovely flowers françois naïvely to eleanora s brother no and i am dying with longing to see that marvellous pearl said the emperor who understood that the king alluded d etampes but even now i think that it is well said that the fairest realm on earth my brother but you have the fairest countship flanders the fairest duchy you refused the first last month said the emperor smiling and you for so doing but you covet the other do you not he a sigh ah let us not talk of serious matters to day my cousin i beg you françois after the pleasures of war there is nothing i confess i like less to disturb than the pleasures of a festal the present it is the truth rejoined charles with the grimace of a miser that he must pay a debt it is the truth that the milanese dear to my heart and that it would be like tearing my heart out it to you say rather to return it to me my brother that word would be and would perhaps soften your disappointment but that is matter in hand now we must enjoy ourselves we will talk of later gift or restitution given or returned said the emperor you the less possess one of the finest lordships in the world for have it my brother it is decided and i will keep my you as faithfully as you keep yours with me mon dieu cried françois beginning to be vexed at this to serious matters what do you regret my brother are king of the spains emperor of germany count of flanders and lord by influence or by right of your sword of all italy from of the alps to the farthest point of calabria but you have france rejoined charles with a sigh you have the indies and their golden treasures you have peru and but you have france you reign over an empire so vast that the sun never sets upon it but you have france what would your majesty say if i should cast on this diamond among kingdoms as fondly and gloatingly as you that pearl of duchies milan look you my brother said françois gravely i have than ideas upon these momentous questions but as they say country do not touch the queen so i say to you do not mon dieu exclaimed charles are we not cousins and allies most certainly was françois s reply and i most earnestly hope will happen henceforth to embitter our relationship or alliance i too hope so said the emperor but he continued with his and hypocritical expression can i answer for the future my son philip for instance from falling out with your such a quarrel would not be dangerous for france if augustus by tiberius what matter who the master is said charles waxing warm the still be the empire and the rome of the cæsars was still the cæsars had ceased to be cæsars in everything save name true but the empire of charles v is not the empire of octavius said françois a little piqued pavia was a glorious battle it was no actium then too octavius was very wealthy while your indian treasures and your peruvian mines you known to be in straitened circumstances financially your were driven to sack rome to procure means of subsistence and rome is sacked they are in revolt and you my brother said charles have alienated the royal domains i am informed and are driven to treat luther very tenderly so german princes may consent to loan you money not to mention the fact retorted françois that your cortes is from being so manageable as the senate while i can boast that freed the kings of france from their dependence forever beware that your parliaments don t put you back into leading fine day discussion was growing warm both monarchs were getting excited long standing antipathy which had kept them apart so long to glow afresh françois was on the point of forgetting of hospitality and charles the dictates of prudence when suddenly remembered that he was beneath his own roof on my word my good brother he exclaimed abruptly laughing aloud by mahomet s belly that we were near losing our tempers you that we must not talk of serious matters but must leave to our ministers and keep for ourselves only our come let us agree once for all that you are to have less france and drop the subject and less the milanese my brother said charles realizing he had been guilty of and seeking at once to avoid for the milanese is yours i have promised it to you and my promise they exchanged these mutual assurances of continuing good will of the gallery opened and madame d etampes appeared the quickly to meet her took her hand and led her to where stood who seeing her then for the first time and being as to what had taken place between her and monsieur de medina his most penetrating gaze upon her as she approached my brother said the king smiling do you see this fair dame not only do i see her replied charles but i admire her very well you do not know what she wants is it one of my spains i will give it her no no brother not that what then she wants me to detain you at paris until you have destroyed the madrid and confirmed by acts the promise you have given me if the advice is good you should follow it rejoined the emperor low before the duchess as much to hide the sudden pallor words caused to overspread his face as to perform an act had no time to say more nor could françois see the effect the words he had laughingly let fall and which charles was to take seriously for the door opened again and the whole into the gallery the half hour preceding dinner when this clever cultivated throng was assembled in the salons of the palace the scene apropos of the reception at the louvre was re enacted in essential details there were the same men and the same women courtiers and the same valets loving and malevolent glances as usual and sarcastic remarks and gallant speeches in with the customary freedom v spying anne de montmorency whom he with good reason be his surest ally went to him and talked in a corner with him duke of medina his ambassador i will sign whatever you choose constable said the emperor who old campaigner s loyalty prepare a deed of cession of the duchy and by saint james though it be one of the brightest jewels crown i will sign an absolute surrender of it to you a deed cried the constable hotly putting aside the suggestion of which implied distrust a deed sire what is your majesty no deed sire no deed your word nothing more does think that we shall have less confidence in you than you had when you came to france with no written document to rely upon you will do as you should do monsieur de montmorency rejoined giving him his hand you will do what you should do constable walked away poor dupe exclaimed the emperor he plays at politics medina dig their holes blindly but the king sire queried medina the king is too proud of his own grandeur of soul not to be sure he will foolishly let us go medina and we will prudently let to make him wait my lord is not to break my promise but its fulfilment that is all but madame d etampes suggested medina as to her we shall see said the emperor moving up and down ring with a superb diamond which he wore on his left thumb ah i must have a long interview with her these words were rapidly exchanged in low tones between and his minister the duchess was mercilessly making sport apropos of his nocturnal exploits all in presence of estourville can it be of your people monsieur de marmagne she was saying tells every comer this extraordinary story attacked by and with but one arm free to defend himself he simply gentry escort him home were you one of these gentlemanly bravos madame replied poor marmagne in confusion it did not take in that way and benvenuto tells the story too favorably yes yes i doubt not that he embroiders it a little and adds a by way of ornament but the main fact is true viscount fact is true and in such matters the main fact is everything madame returned marmagne i promise you that i will have my revenge i shall be more fortunate next time pardon viscount pardon it s not a question of revenge but another game cellini i should say has won the first yes thanks to my absence muttered marmagne with because my men took advantage of my not being there away the miserable villains oh said the provost i advise you marmagne to admit that you in that direction you have no luck with cellini in that case it seems to me that we may console each other my retorted marmagne for if we add known facts to rumors which are in circulation the capture of nesle to the reported disappearance of one of its cellini would seem not to have brought you luck either d estourville to be sure he is said to be actively the fortunes of your family if not in your own my dear provost monsieur de marmagne cried the provost fiercely in a furious rage that his paternal infelicity was beginning to be monsieur de marmagne you will explain to me later what by your words ah messieurs messieurs exclaimed the duchess do not forget i that i am here you are both in the wrong monsieur le prévôt not for those who know so little about seeking to ridicule those so little about finding monsieur de marmagne in the hour we must unite against the common enemy and not afford him satisfaction of seeing the vanquished slashing at s throats they are going to the salle à manger your hand de marmagne ah well since it seems that men for all avail nothing against cellini we will see if a woman s find him equally invincible i have always thought that allies in the way and have always loved to make war alone the risk i know but at least the honors of victory are not to be any one the impertinent varlet exclaimed marmagne see how familiarly he to our great king would not one say he was nobly born is naught but a mere stone cutter what s that you say viscount why he is a nobleman and of the nobility said the duchess with a laugh do you know among our oldest families who descend from a lieutenant of and who have the three fleurs de lis and the lambel of of anjou in their crest t is not the king who honors by speaking to him messieurs as you see the sculptor on hand confers honor upon the king by condescending to françois i and cellini were in fact conversing at that moment familiarity to which the great ones of earth had accustomed artist of heaven well benvenuto the king was saying how do we come on with i am preparing to cast it sire and when will that great work be performed immediately upon my return to paris sire take our best foundrymen cellini and omit nothing to make successful if you need money you know that i am ready i know that you are the greatest the noblest and the most on earth sire replied benvenuto but thanks to the salary majesty orders paid to me i am rich as to the which you are somewhat anxious sire i will with permission rely upon my own resources to prepare and i distrust all your french foundrymen not that they are unskilful because i am afraid that their national pride will make to place their skill at the service of an artist from alps and i confess sire that i attach too much importance to of my jupiter to allow any other than myself to lay hand to it bravo cellini bravo cried the king spoken like a true artist moreover added benvenuto i wish to be entitled to remind of the promise you made me that is right my trusty friend if we are content with it we are you a boon we have not forgotten indeed if we should forget ourselves in the presence of witnesses is it not so montmorency poyet our constable and our chancellor will remind us of word ah your majesty cannot conceive how precious that word has become since the day it was given very well it shall be kept monsieur but the doors are open messieurs to table thereupon joined the emperor and the two together walked head of the procession formed by the illustrious guests both the folding doors being thrown open the two sovereigns entered side and took places facing each other charles between eleanora d etampes françois between catherine de medicis and navarre banquet was exquisite and the guests in the best of spirits was in his element and enjoyed himself in kingly fashion like a serf at all the tales told him by marguerite de navarre overwhelmed madame d etampes with compliments and attentions others talked of art and politics and so the time passed illustration 06 dessert as was customary the pages brought water for the guests their hands thereupon madame d etampes took the ewer and for charles v from the hands of the servitor while the same for françois poured water from the ewer into the basin kneeling upon one knee according to the spanish etiquette the basin to the emperor he dipped the ends of his fingers at his noble and beautiful attendant the while and the superb ring of which we have spoken into the water your majesty is losing your ring said anne dipping her own into the water and daintily picking up the jewel which to the emperor keep the ring madame the emperor replied in a low voice the which it now is are too noble and too beautiful for me to take them again it is to bind the bargain for the duchy of milan in a still lower tone duchess smiled and said no more the pebble had fallen at her feet the pebble was worth a million they returned from the salle à manger to the salon and to the ball room madame d etampes stopped benvenuto who near to her by the press messire cellini said she handing him the ring which constituted of the alliance between the emperor and herself here is which you will hand if you please to your pupil ascanio crown of my lily it is the dew drop i promised him and it has fallen from aurora s fingers in very truth madame the artist with a mocking smile and affected gallantry glanced at the ring and started back in surprise for he diamond he had long ago set for pope clement vii and had to the sublime emperor on the sovereign pontiff s behalf induce charles v to divest himself of such a priceless jewel in favor of a woman there must necessarily be some some occult treaty between himself and the recipient charles continues to pass his days and nights at fontainebleau alternations of distrust and confidence we have endeavored while he schemes intrigues burrows underground promises and promises anew let us cast a glance upon the grand nesle see if anything of interest is occurring among those of who have remained there ghostly whole colony was in a state of intense excitement the ghost of the unsubstantial guest of the convent upon the ruins of s palace was built had returned within three or four days had seen him walking around at night in the gardens of nesle clad in his long white frock and treading so lightly left no footprints on the ground and made no noise happened it that dame perrine whose domicile was the petit nesle seen the ghostly visitor walking in the garden of the grand nesle o clock in the morning we cannot tell except by committing a indiscretion but we are historians first of all and our entitled to know the most secret details of the lives of we have brought upon the stage especially when those calculated to throw a bright light upon the sequel of our narrative perrine by virtue of colombe s disappearance by the retirement for whose presence there was no further pretext and by of the provost was left absolute mistress of the petit nesle the gardener raimbault and his assistants were for engaged in messire d estourville s service during the day only perrine found herself therefore queen of the petit nesle but same time a solitary queen so that she nearly died of ennui day and of fear at night occurred to her that there was a remedy for this of affairs during the day at least her friendly dame ruperta opened the doors of the grand nesle to her she to visit her neighbors and it was most cordially granted upon availing herself of this permission dame perrine was in contact with her neighbors of the other sex dame perrine buxom creature of thirty six years who confessed to twenty nine plump and rosy still and always prepossessing her coming an event in the studio where ten or twelve worthy fellows cutting filing hammering chiselling good livers all play on sundays of wine on sundays and holidays and of the fair the time three of our old acquaintances after three or four passed were all brought down with the same arrow were little jehan simon le gaucher and hermann the german jacques aubry and pagolo escaped the charm having their other things other comrades may well have felt some sparks of this greek fire they realized their inferior position no doubt and poured of their humility upon the first sparks before they became jehan loved after the manner of cherubino that is to say he love with loving dame perrine as the reader will had too much common sense to respond to such an as that le gaucher could offer more reliable future prospects and promised to be more enduring but dame perrine was a person she had seen simon cross himself with his and she reflected that it would be necessary for him to sign contract with his left hand dame perrine was convinced sign of the cross executed with the left hand was calculated rather than to save a soul and in like manner no one could her that a marriage contract signed with the left hand any other result than an unhappy menage she therefore but the reasons for her repugnance received simon le gaucher advances in a way to make him renounce all hope remained ah hermann that was a different matter was no coxcomb like little jehan nor a man with the seal s displeasure upon him like left handed simon in hermann there was something honest and outspoken which appealed perrine s heart moreover hermann instead of having a left the right and vice versa made use of either or both that he seemed to have two right hands he was man too according to all vulgar ideas dame had fixed her choice upon hermann as we know hermann was as innocent as celadon the result was perrine s first broadsides the pouting and sighs and were utterly powerless against the naïve timidity of german he contented himself with staring at dame perrine out great round eyes but like the blind men of the gospel eyes but he saw not or if he did see he saw the buxom governess as simply without noting details dame perrine repeatedly they should go for a walk on the quai des augustins or in of the grand or petit nesle and on every occasion she for her cavalier this made hermann very happy internally teutonic heart beat five or six extra pulsations a minute perrine was hanging upon his arm but either because he found in pronouncing the french language or because it gave pleasure to hear the object of his secret thoughts talk could rarely extract anything more from him than these phrases ponchour matemoizelle and atieu which hermann generally pronounced at an interval of the first when dame perrine took his arm the second when she go now although this title of mademoiselle was immensely dame perrine and although there was something very agreeable two hours without fear of interruption she would have been have her monologue broken in upon by an occasional interjection give her some idea of the progress she was making in the heart mute attendant progress however was none the less real for not being expressed or by play of feature the fire was kindled in the honest german and being fanned every day by dame perrine s presence became volcano hermann began at last to be conscious of dame perrine accorded him and he was only waiting until a little more certain of it to declare himself dame his hesitation one evening as he parted from her at of the petit nesle she saw that he was so agitated that it would be a real kindness on her part to press his hand transported with delight responded by a similar demonstration to his great amazement dame perrine gave a piercing shriek in bliss hermann did not measure his pressure he thought tighter he squeezed her hand the more accurate idea he would the violence of his passion and he very nearly crushed the s fingers was thunderstruck by her shriek but dame perrine fearing him just as he had summoned up courage to make his forced herself to smile and said as she separated which were almost glued together for the moment it s nothing nothing dear monsieur hermann it s nothing tausend pardons matemoizelle perrine said the german but i sehr viel and i haf pressed your hant as i lofe you there s no need monsieur hermann there s no need your love is love i trust which a woman need not blush to win o tieu o tieu cried hermann indeed my lofe is honorable perrine put i haf not yet tared to speak to you of it die wort haf escaped me i lofe you i lofe you i lofe you matemoizelle perrine and i monsieur hermann said dame perrine mincingly think i for i believe you to be a gallant youth incapable of poor woman that mon dieu how shall i say it oh say it say it cried hermann well that ah it is wrong of me to confess it nein nein it is not wrong say it say it very well i confess that i am not indifferent to your passion sacrement cried the german beside himself with joy one evening when after a promenade the juliet of the petit escorted her romeo to the door of the grand nesle she espied as returning alone through the garden door the white spectre we which in the opinion of the worthy governess could be than that of the monk it is needless to say that dame the house half dead with fear and barricaded herself in next morning the whole studio was acquainted with the story of apparition dame perrine however contented herself the simple fact without going into details the ghostly appeared that was the whole of it it was useless to question her she would say nothing more that day the ghostly monk was the engrossing subject of the grand nesle some believed in the appearance of the phantom laughed at it it was noticed that ascanio was the leader of the others being little jehan simon le gaucher and the faction of the believers included dame ruperta scozzone and hermann the evening they all assembled in the second courtyard of nesle dame perrine when questioned in the morning as to of the legend of the ghostly monk requested that she might day to refresh her memory and when night came she announced was ready to relate the awful story dame perrine was as knowing matter of stage effects as a modern dramatist and she knew that story loses all its effect if told in the sunlight while on hand that effect is doubled if it is told in the dark audience consisted of hermann who sat at her right dame ruperta sat at her left pagolo and scozzone who sat side by side aubry who lay on the grass between his two friends and simon le gaucher ascanio had declared that he held such s tales in utter contempt and would not even listen to them unt zo matemoizelle perrine said hermann after a moment of silence each one arranged his posture so as to listen at ease unt zo going to tell us the story of the monk s ghost yes said dame perrine yes but i ought to warn you that it s story and perhaps not a very comfortable one to listen to hour but as we are all devout persons although there may be among us on the subject of ghosts and as monsieur hermann enough to put satan himself to flight if he should make i will venture to tell you the story pardon pardon matemoizelle perrine put if satan comes i must not to count on me i will fight mit men ja all you choose mit der teufel never mind i will fight him if he comes dame perrine said go on and don t be afraid is there a charcoal purner in your story matemoizelle perrine hermann a charcoal burner no monsieur hermann all right it s all the same why a charcoal burner because in all the cherman stories there is a charcoal purner mind it must be a fine story all the same go on you must know then began dame perrine that there was formerly spot where we now sit and before the hôtel de nesle was built of monks composed of the handsomest men ever seen of whom was as tall as monsieur hermann peste what a community that must have been cried jacques aubry be quiet babbler said scozzone yes be quiet pappler echoed hermann i ll be quiet i ll be quiet said the student go on dame perrine the prior whose name was enguerrand was a particularly fine specimen all had glossy black beards with black and gleaming eyes but had the blackest beard and the brightest eyes of all moreover brethren were devout and austere in their devotion to degree and their voices were so melodious and sweet came from leagues around simply to hear them sing the at least so i have been told oh the poor monks said ruperta it s extremely interesting said jacques aubry es ist sehr wunderbar said hermann one day pursued dame perrine flattered by the marks of by her narrative a handsome young man was brought before who requested to be admitted to the convent as a novice he beard as yet but he had large eyes as black as ebony and long with a glossy shimmer like jet so that he was admitted he said that his name was antonio and requested to to the personal service of the prior a request which without hesitation i spoke of voices just now but antonio the fresh and melodious voice par excellence everybody who sing on the following sunday was carried away by it and yet a something in the voice which distressed even while it a quality which aroused worldly rather than celestial ideas in of those who listened to it but all the monks were so pure that none but strangers experienced this singular emotion and who was utterly unconscious of anything of the sort was with antonio s voice that he appointed him thenceforth to responses in the anthems alone alternately with the organ the conduct of the young novice was most exemplary and he waited prior with incredible zeal and earnestness the only thing for could possibly be reproved was his constant fits of distraction devotions always and everywhere his glowing eyes were fastened prior what are you looking at antonio don enguerrand would say to him i am looking at you my father would be the reply look at your prayer book antonio now what are you looking at you my father antonio look at the image of the virgin what are you looking you my father antonio look at the crucifix which we adore don enguerrand began to notice after a time upon searching that since antonio s reception into the community he more troubled than formerly by evil thoughts never before had more than seven times a day which as we all know is of the saints sometimes even he had examined his conduct day without being able to find more than five or six sins thing but now the total of his daily peccadillos high as ten twelve or even fifteen he would try to make up for the following day he would pray and fast and scourge himself worthy man ah but the farther he went the greater became until at last it reached a full score poor don not which way to turn he felt that he was damned in spite of could do and he noticed an observation which might have but which increased his consternation that his most were under the same strange incredible so that their confession which formerly lasted half an hour or an hour at most now occupied several hours about this time an occurrence which had been creating a great stir province for a month past at last became known at the convent of a castle near by had lost his daughter antonia antonia one fine evening exactly as my poor colombe has disappeared there is this difference i am sure that colombe is an angel seems that antonia was possessed of the devil the poor father the fugitive high and low just as monsieur le prévôt colombe only the convent remained to be visited and as he the evil spirit the better to elude search sometimes in monasteries he sent his chaplain to don enguerrand to to make search in his the prior assented with the grace perhaps he thought he might by means of this something concerning the magic influence which had upon him and his brethren for a month past but no the no result whatever and the nobleman was about to retire than ever when all the monks passed in procession before don enguerrand on their way to the chapel for the evening service looked at them mechanically one after another until the last when he cried out god in heaven that is antonia that is my daughter antonia for it was she became as pale as a lily what are you doing in this sacred garb continued the father what am i doing father said antonia i am loving don all my heart leave this convent instantly wretched girl cried her father i will go out only as a corpse father replied antonia thereupon despite her father s outcries she darted into the chapel heels of the monks and took her place in her accustomed stall stood as if turned to stone the furious nobleman would his daughter but don enguerrand begged him not to profane place by such a scandalous scene and to wait until the service an end the father consented and followed don enguerrand into the anthem was about to be chanted and the majestic prelude upon was like the voice of god a wonderfully beautiful strain with bitter irony and awful to bear responded to the of the instrument it was antonia s voice and every shuddered the organ took up the chant calm grave impressive seemed as if it were seeking to drown with its divine bitter strains which insulted it from the stalls again as if of the challenge antonia s voice arose more more impious than before everybody awaited in the result of this awful dialogue this alternation of prayer this strange conflict between god and satan and it was most intense and agonizing silence that the celestial music like a peal of thunder when the blasphemous strain died away out upon the heads of the listeners all bowed save one of its wrath it was something like the dread voice which will hear on the judgment day antonia tried to keep up but her song this time was nothing more than a shrill rending cry like the laugh fit the damned and she fell pale upon the pavement of the chapel when they raised her she jésus maria cried dame ruperta poor antonia said hermann innocently little fool muttered jacques aubry others kept silence so great was the impression produced even sceptics by dame perrine s narrative but scozzone wiped away and pagolo crossed himself when the prior resumed dame perrine saw the devil s messenger by the wrath of god he believed poor dear man that he delivered from the snares of the tempter but he his host a very appropriate expression as he had been as to extend his hospitality to one possessed of the devil following night just after he had dropped off to sleep he by the clanking of chains he opened his eyes them toward the door and saw that it swung open unaided and same time a phantom clad in the white robe of a novice drew near took him by the arm and cried i am antonia antonia who and god has given me full power over thee because thou in thought if not in act and every night at midnight apparition returned implacably true to its word until at enguerrand made a pilgrimage to the holy land and died by favor of god just as he knelt before the holy sepulchre but antonia was not satisfied she fell back upon all the monks and as there were very few who had not sinned as deeply as prior she visited them all one after another during the night awaking them and crying in an awe inspiring voice i i am antonia who loves thee hence the name of the ghostly monk when you are walking through the streets at night and a figure with or white hood dogs your steps hasten home it is the ghostly quest of prey when the convent was demolished to make room for the château to be rid of the spectre but it seems that he is fond of at various times he has reappeared and now god forgive us the unhappy wretch has appeared again may god preserve us wicked designs amen said dame ruperta crossing herself amen said hermann with a shudder amen said jacques aubry laughing each of the others repeated the word with an to the impression produced upon him one sees at night from the top of the following day which was that on which the whole court was from fontainebleau it was dame ruperta s turn to announce to auditory that she had a momentous revelation to make may be imagined after such an interesting announcement the assembled once more in the same spot at the same hour were entirely at their ease because benvenuto had written that he should stay behind for two or three days to prepare where his jupiter was to be displayed which jupiter was to be upon his return provost had simply made his appearance at the hôtel de nesle to there was any news of colombe but upon being informed by that everything was in statu quo he at once returned to occupants of the grand and petit nesle enjoyed entire freedom therefore both masters being absent the ease of jacques aubry although he was to have met gervaise curiosity carried the day over love or rather he hoped ruperta would be less diffuse than dame perrine and that she finished so early that he might hear her story and still keep is what ruperta had to tell perrine s narrative ran in her head all night long and from that she entered her bedroom she trembled in every limb s spirit should pay her a visit notwithstanding the which hung about her bed barricaded her door but that was a very inadequate precaution servant was too well versed in the ways of phantoms not to be they know nothing of closed doors nevertheless she would also to barricade the window looking upon the garden of nesle but the original proprietor had neglected to provide with shutters and the present proprietor deemed it useless himself with that expense there were curtains at the window but at this time as have it they were at the laundry the window offered therefore save an unpretentious pane of glass as the air that it excluded entering the room ruperta looked under the bed felt in all and closets and did not leave a single corner uninspected that the devil occupies but little space when he draws in his claws and horns and that asmodeus was corked up in a bottle knows how many years room was entirely untenanted and there was not the slightest the ghostly monk went to bed therefore somewhat more at ease but she left burning none the less she was no sooner in bed than she the window and saw outside the window a gigantic figure were just discernible in the darkness and which light of the stars the moon was invisible as it was in its ruperta shivered with fear she was on the point of crying out when she remembered the colossal statue of mars which head before her window she immediately looked again in and recognized perfectly all the outlines of the god of war reassured ruperta for the moment and she determined positively to sleep sleep the poor man s treasure so often coveted by the rich is man s orders at night god opens heaven s gates for him and rascal visits whom he pleases turning aside him who calls and knocking at their doors who least expect him invoked him long before he paid heed to her last toward midnight fatigue won the day little by little woman s faculties became confused her thoughts which were but ill connected broke the imperceptible thread which and scattered like the beads of a rosary her heart alone by fear was still awake at last it too fell fast asleep all was said the lamp alone kept vigil like all things of earth the lamp found rest two hours had closed her eyes in the sleep of the just upon the it had no oil to burn it began to grow dim sputtered blazed an instant and then died at that time ruperta had a fearful dream she dreamed that as returning home from visiting perrine the ghostly monk pursued her happily against all precedents of those who dream ruperta to found that she had the legs of fifteen years and fled so the ghostly monk although he seemed to glide and not to run ground only arrived in time to have the door slammed in his face thought still dreaming that she heard him snarl and pound door but as may be imagined she was in no haste to let him in lit her lamp ran up the stairs four at a time jumped into bed out the light just as she put out the light she saw the monk s head outside he had crawled up the wall like a lizard and was trying to the glass in her dream she heard the grinding of his it sleep can be so sound as to hold out against a dream of that sort awoke with her hair standing on end and dripping with her eyes were open staring wildly around and in spite they sought the window with that she uttered a fearful shriek is what she saw saw the head of the colossal mars shooting forth flame from its nose and mouth and ears thought at first that she was still asleep and that it was of her dream but she pinched herself till the blood make sure that she was really awake she crossed herself mentally three paters and two aves and the did not disappear summoned strength enough to put out her hand seize her broom pound against the ceiling with the handle thereof hermann slept room above hers and she hoped that the sturdy teuton would and hurry to her assistance but in vain did ruperta knock gave no sign of life she changed the direction of her blows and instead on the ceiling to arouse hermann began to knock on the arouse pagolo who slept in the room below pagolo was as deaf as hermann and ruperta pounded to no purpose then abandoned the vertical for the horizontal line ascanio was and she knocked on the partition with her broom handle all was silence in ascanio s quarters as in those of hermann it was evident that neither of the three was at home in it occurred to ruperta that the monk had carried off all them there was little consolation in this idea ruperta s terror and greater and as she was certain that no one would come assistance she thrust her head beneath the bedclothes and waited waited an hour an hour and a half two hours perhaps and as no noise she regained her courage in a measure softly sheet from her head and ventured to look with one eye then the vision had disappeared the head of mars had gone out and dark once more the silence and darkness were calculated to set her mind it will readily be understood that dame ruperta and slumber odds for the balance of the night the poor woman lay with her the alert and both eyes wide open until the first rays of on her window announced that the time for ghosts to walk this is what ruperta had to tell and it must be said in her her narrative produced an even deeper impression than that of night its effect upon dame perrine and hermann scozzone was particularly noticeable the two men essayed to make not hearing ruperta but their voices trembled so and was so great that jacques aubry roared with laughter perrine and scozzone on the other hand did not breathe a word turned red and pale by turns so that if it had been daylight could have followed upon their faces the reflection of what place in their minds you would have believed them at the death from apoplexy and again from inanition all within and so dame perrrine said scozzone who was the first to recover possession you claim to have seen the monk s ghost walking in of the grand nesle as plainly as i see you my child was dame perrrine s reply and you ruperta saw the head of the mars on fire i can see it still look you said dame perrine the accursed ghost must have chosen of the statue for his domicile and as a ghost must of course little exercise now and then like a natural being he comes down hours walks hither and thither and when he s tired goes the head idols and spirits you see understand one another on market day they live in hell together and this god mars naturally enough offers his hospitality to the pelieve you zo dame perrine queried the innocent german i am sure of it monsieur hermann sure of it it makes my flesh to greep on my vord muttered hermann with so you believe in ghosts hermann asked aubry ja i do pelieve in tem aubry shrugged his shoulders but as he did so he determined the mystery it was the easiest thing in the world for one who himself went in and out of the house as familiarly as if he of the family he made up his mind therefore that he would go gervaise the next day but that on this evening he would remain grand nesle until ten o clock at ten o clock he would say to everybody and pretend to go away but that he would the precincts climb a poplar and make the acquaintance of from a hiding place among the branches fell out as the student planned he left the studio alone shut the door leading into the quay with a great noise that he had gone out then ran rapidly to the foot of seized the lowest branch drew himself up to it by his wrists in an instant was at the top of the tree there he was just on with the head of the statue and overlooked both the grand nesle so that nothing could take place in the courtyard or either unseen by him jacques aubry was taking up his position on his lofty perch soirée was in progress at the louvre and all the windows with light charles v had finally decided to and venture within the walls of the capital and the had entered paris that same evening gorgeous welcoming fête awaited the emperor there there was gaming and a ball gondolas lighted by colored lanterns and down the seine laden with musicians and made melodious front of the famous balcony from which thirty years later was to fire upon his people while boats gayly decked with from one bank of the river to the other those guests who their way from the faubourg saint germain to the louvre or who to the faubourg saint germain the guests the vicomte de marmagne was naturally included we have said the vicomte de marmagne a tall pink cheeked claimed to be a great destroyer of hearts on this occasion that a certain pretty little countess whose husband happened with the army in savoy cast meaning glances at him thereupon with her and fancied that her hand was not insensible to he ventured to bestow upon it and so when he saw the of his thoughts leave the ball room he imagined from the gave him as she departed that like galatea she was flying willows in the hope of being pursued marmagne therefore set out and as she lived in the vicinity of rue hautefeuille his from the louvre to the tour de nesle and thence along the quay rue des grands augustins to rue saint andré he was the quay when he heard steps behind him was about one o clock in the morning the moon as we have said her last quarter so that the night was quite dark among moral qualities with which nature had endowed marmagne courage hold a prominent position he began therefore after a while to disturbed by these footsteps which seemed to be following and quickened his gait wrapping himself more closely than ever cloak and instinctively grasping the hilt of his sword the acceleration of speed profited him not the steps themselves by his and even seemed to gain upon him so that as he passed the doorway of the church of the augustins he he should very soon be overtaken by his fellow traveller unless his pace still more to a racing speed he was just about that extreme course when the sound of a voice mingled with of the footsteps pardieu my fine sir you do well to walk fast said the voice isn t a very safe place especially at this hour right here of course is where my worthy friend benvenuto benvenuto the sublime artist who is at fontainebleau moment and has no suspicion of what is going on under his roof as we are going in the same direction apparently we can walk and if we meet any cut throats they will look twice attack us i offer you therefore the safeguard of my companionship you will give me the honor of yours the first word our student uttered marmagne knew that it was of one who wished him no ill and at the name of benvenuto and recognized the garrulous law student who had on occasion given him so much useful information concerning of the grand nesle he at once halted and waited for aubry to come up for his society would be of advantage to two ways in the first place he would serve as a sort of body guard might in the mean while give him some fresh information enemy which his hatred would enable him to turn to advantage welcomed the student with his most agreeable manner good evening my young friend he said in reply to the addressed to him by jacques aubry in the darkness what saying of our good benvenuto whom i hoped to meet at the louvre who has remained at fontainebleau like the fox that he is well by my soul here s luck cried jacques aubry what is it you dear vicomte de you forgot to tell me your name or i forgot it you come from the louvre was it very lovely very lively love making galore we are in good luck my gentleman aren t we heart breaker faith said marmagne with a simper you re a sorcerer my yes i come from the louvre where the king said some things to me and where i should still he if a little countess had not signified to me that she preferred à deux to all that crush but whence come you whence come i rejoined aubry with a hearty laugh faith you poor benvenuto on my word he doesn t deserve it pray what has happened to our dear friend in the first place you must know that i come from the grand nesle i have passed two hours clinging to the branch of a tree like the devil that was no very comfortable position never mind never mind i don t regret the cramp i got there for i my friend i saw things why simply in thinking of them with laughter he spoke jacques aubry did laugh so joyously and frankly that marmagne had as yet no idea what he was laughing at he forbear joining in the chorus but his ignorance of the cause of s amusement naturally made him the first to cease now my young friend that i have been drawn on by your hilarity in confidence said marmagne may i not know what they were to amuse you so you know that i am one of benvenuto friends although i have never met you at his house as leaves me very little time to devote to society and i prefer to devote to my mistresses rather than my friends but it is none the less true that whatever affects him dear benvenuto tell me what is going on at the grand nesle in that interests me more than i can explain to you what is going on said aubry no no that s a secret a secret to me said marmagne a secret to me who love benvenuto and who this very evening outdid king françois i in ah that is too bad added the viscount with an if i were only sure that you would mention it to nobody my dear devil is your name my dear friend i would tell you about it confess that i am as anxious to tell my story as king midas s to tell theirs tell it then tell it said marmagne you won t repeat it to anybody to nobody i swear on your word of honor on the faith of a nobleman fancy then but in the first place my dear friend you know of the monk s ghost don t you yes i ve heard of it a phantom that is said to haunt nesle just so well well if you know that i can tell you the rest dame perrine colombe s governess just so well well it s easy to see that you re a friend of fancy then that dame perrine in a nocturnal walk which she for her health thought that she saw the ghostly monk also walk in the garden of the grand nesle while at the same time you know dame ruperta isn t she cellini s old servant just so while dame ruperta during one of her fits of sleeplessness flames darting from the eyes nose and mouth of the great statue which you have seen in the gardens of the grand nesle yes a veritable chef d œuvre said marmagne chef d œuvre is the word cellini makes nothing else flow respectable ladies i speak of dame perrine and dame ruperta themselves that the two apparitions had the same cause and demon who stalked abroad at night in the guise of the ghostly monk at cock crow into the head of the god mars a fitting a lost soul like him and was there consumed by such fierce they came out through the statue s eyes nose and ears what sort of a fairy tale is this my dear man said marmagne tell whether the student was joking or talking seriously the tale of a ghost my friend nothing more nor less can it be that an intelligent fellow like you believes in such stuff why no i don t believe in it said jacques aubry that is just why to pass the night in a poplar tree to clear up the mystery find out who the demon really is who is upsetting the so i pretended to come out but instead of closing the the grand nesle behind me i closed it in front of me glided back darkness without being seen and got safely to the poplar upon had my eye five minutes later i was snugly ensconced among on a level with mars s head now guess what i saw how can i guess pray to be sure one must be a sorcerer to guess such things in the i saw the great door open the door at the top of the steps yes yes i know it said marmagne i saw the door open and a man put his nose out to see if there was in the courtyard it was hermann the fat german yes hermann the fat german echoed marmagne when he was fully assured that the courtyard was deserted about everywhere except in the tree where as you can imagine was very far from suspecting my presence he came out closed behind him descended the five or six steps and went straight door of the petit nesle where he knocked three times at a woman came out of the petit nesle and opened the door was our friend dame perrine who apparently has a weakness about at night with our goliath no really oh the poor provost wait a moment wait that s not all i was looking after them as into the petit nesle when suddenly i heard the grating of sash at my left i turned the window opened and out that brigand of a pagolo who would have believed it of all his protestations and his paters and aves out came pagolo after looking about as cautiously as hermann straddled slid down the gutter and went from balcony to balcony reached the window guess of whose room viscount how can i tell was it dame ruperta s oh no scozzone s nothing less scozzone benvenuto s a lovely brunette my word for it can you believe it of viscount indeed it s most diverting said marmagne is that all you saw wait a bit wait a bit my dear fellow i have kept the best till the best morsel for the bonne bouche wait a bit we aren yet but we soon shall be never fear i am listening said marmagne on my honor my dear fellow it couldn more diverting wait a bit i say wait a bit i was watching my pagolo running to balcony at the risk of breaking his neck when i noise which came almost from the foot of the tree in which sitting i looked down and saw ascanio creeping stealthily the foundry ascanio benvenuto s beloved pupil himself my friend himself a sort of choir boy to whom one absolution without confession oh yes that comes of trusting why had ascanio come out ah that s just it why had he that s what i asked myself at first soon i had no occasion to ask it for ascanio after having as hermann and pagolo had done that nobody could see him the foundry a long ladder which he rested against the shoulders and up he climbed as the ladder was on the opposite side i lost sight of him as he went up and was just wondering become of him when i saw a light in the eyes of the statue what s that you say cried marmagne the exact truth my friend and i confess that if it had any knowledge on my part of what had happened previously not have been altogether at my ease but i had seen and i suspected that the light was caused by him but what was ascanio doing at that hour in the head of the god mars ah that is just the question i asked myself and as there was no answer me i determined to find out for myself i gazed with all and succeeded in discovering through those of the statue i faith yes dressed all in white the ghost of a woman feet ascanio was kneeling as respectfully as before a madonna the madonna s back was turned to me and i could not face but i saw her neck oh what lovely necks ghosts have my imagine a perfect swan s neck white as snow and ascanio at it the impious varlet with a degree of adoration me that the ghost was a woman what do you say to that fellow gad it s a neat trick eh to conceal one s mistress head of a statue yes yes it s most ingenious rejoined marmagne laughing at the same time very ingenious in good sooth and no suspicion who the woman can be upon my honor i have no idea and you no more than you what did you do pray when you saw all this what did i do i laughed so that i lost my balance and if i hadn on a branch i should have broken my neck as there was to see and i had fallen half way to the ground i climbed down of the way crept to the door and was on my way home all by myself when i met you and you compelled me to tell story now give me your advice as you are of benvenuto s friends must i do about telling him as for dame perrine that doesn him the dear woman is of age and consequently mistress of but as to scozzone and the venus who lodges in the head it s a different matter and you want me to advise you as to what you ought to do yes i do indeed i am much perplexed my dear my dear i your name my advice is to say nothing to him so much the worse for those who enough to allow themselves to be deceived i am obliged to you jacques aubry for your company and your agreeable conversation here we are at rue hautefeuille and to return confidence this is where my charmer dwells adieu my dear my excellent friend said jacques aubry pressing s hand your advice is good and i will follow it good luck may cupid watch over you they parted marmagne taking rue hautefeuille and rue poupée on his way to rue de la harpe at the far end he had taken up his abode viscount lied to the unlucky student when he declared that he had as to the identity of the female demon whom ascanio adored knees his first thought was that the inhabitant of mars was than colombe and the more he reflected upon it the more he became as we have said marmagne was equally ill the provost d orbec and cellini and he found himself in a position as regarded the gratification of his ill will for not inflict suffering upon one without giving pleasure to if he held his peace d orbec and the provost would remain present embarrassed plight but benvenuto would likewise his present joyous frame of mind if on the other hand he he had learned benvenuto would be in despair but the recover his child d orbec his betrothed he determined to turn the thing over in his mind until it should be to him what was the most advantageous course for him to follow indecision did not long endure without knowing the real motive interest he was aware that madame d etampes was deeply the marriage of comte d orbec with colombe he thought that his secret to the duchess he might gain sufficient credit to make up for what he had lost in the matter of courage resolved therefore to appear at her morning reception on day and tell her everything having formed that resolution punctually put it in execution one of those fortunate chances which sometimes serve the purpose deeds so well all the courtiers were at the louvre paying françois i and the emperor and there was nobody at etampes s reception save her two faithful servants the provost d orbec when the vicomte de marmagne was announced viscount respectfully saluted the duchess who acknowledged with one of those smiles which belonged to her alone and she could express pride condescension and disdain all at time but marmagne did not worry about this smile with which well acquainted from having seen it upon the duchess s lips not his own benefit but for the benefit of many another he that he possessed a certain means of transforming that smile into a smile of good will by a single word aha messire d estourville he said turning to the provost so child has returned still the same pleasantry viscount cried messire d estourville threatening gesture and flushing with anger oh don t lose your temper my good friend don t lose your temper marmagne i tell you this because if you haven t yet vanished dove i know where she has built her nest you do cried the duchess in the most charmingly friendly way where is it pray tell me quickly i beg my dear marmagne in the head of the statue of mars which benvenuto has modelled in of the grand nesle and reader will doubtless have guessed the truth no less marmagne strange as it may have appeared at first glance the the colossus was colombe s place of retreat mars for venus as jacques aubry said for the second gave his handiwork a part to play in his life summoned to the assistance of the man and embodied his fate in as well as his thought and his genius he had on an concealed his means of escape in one of his figures he was colombe s freedom and ascanio s happiness in another having reached this point in our narrative it becomes greater clearness to retrace our steps a moment cellini finished the story of stefana there was a brief pause saw among the phantoms which stood out vividly in obtrusive memories of the past the melancholy but of stefana twenty years dead ascanio with head bent forward trying to recall the pale face of the woman who had leaned over and often awoke him in his infancy while the tears fell from eyes upon his chubby cheeks colombe was gazing with deep emotion whom another woman young and pure like herself had loved at that moment his voice seemed to her almost as soft s and between the two both of whom loved her devotedly instinctively that she was as safe as a child could be upon s knee was the first to break the silence well he said will colombe trust herself to the man to whom ascanio you are my father he my brother replied colombe giving a hand of them with modest grace and dignity and i place myself your hands to keep me for my husband thanks said ascanio thanks my beloved for your trust in him you promise to obey me in everything colombe said benvenuto in everything then listen my children i have always been convinced that man what he would but only with the assistance of god on high and below to save you from comte d orbec and infamy and to give my ascanio i must have time colombe and in a very few days you be the count s wife first of all then the essential thing is this unholy union is it not colombe my sister my child there are times in this sad life when it is necessary to in order to prevent a crime will you be courageous and resolute your love which is so pure and devoted be brave and strong tell me ascanio will answer for me said colombe with a smile turning to it is his right to dispose of me have no fear master colombe will be brave said ascanio in that case colombe will you trusting in our loyalty and your boldly leave this house and go with us started in surprise colombe looked at them both for a speaking then rose to her feet and said simply where am i to go o colombe colombe cried benvenuto deeply moved by such you are a noble saintly creature and yet stefana made me in my ideal everything depended upon your reply we are but there isn t a moment to lose this is the decisive hour it at our disposal let us avail ourselves of it give me colombe and follow me maiden lowered her veil as if to hide her blush from itself the master and ascanio the door between the grand nesle was locked but the key was in the lock benvenuto opened they were passing through colombe stopped wait a moment she said in a voice trembling with emotion and threshold of the house which she was leaving because it had be a sanctuary for her the child knelt and prayed her a secret between god and herself but doubtless she prayed would forgive her father for what she was driven to do then calm and strong and went on under the guidance of cellini with troubled heart followed them in silence gazing fondly white dress which fled before him in the shadow they walked way across the garden of the grand nesle the songs and heedless laughter of the workmen at their supper for it will that it was a holiday at the château reached the ears friends who were anxious and nervous as people ordinarily are moments they reached the foot of the statue benvenuto left colombe went to the foundry and reappeared laden with a long he leaned against the colossus the moon the celestial watcher her pale light upon the scene having made sure that the ladder fixed in its place the master knelt upon one knee in front the most touching respect softened the sternness of my child said he put your arms around me and hold fast obeyed without a word and benvenuto lifted her as if she a feather the brother he said to ascanio as he drew near must allow to carry his beloved daughter powerful goldsmith laden with the most precious of all burdens up the ladder as lightly as if he were carrying nothing a bird as her head lay upon the master s shoulder colombe his manly good humored faee and felt a degree of filial trust which was unlike anything she had ever experienced as to cellini powerful was the will of this man of iron that he was able to in his arms for whom he would have given his life two with a hand that did not tremble nor did his heart heat or a single one of his muscles of steel weaken for an instant had ordered his heart to be calm and his heart had obeyed he reached the neck of the statue he opened a small door head and deposited colombe therein interior of this colossal head of a statue nearly sixty feet a small round room some eight feet in diameter and ten air and light made their way in through the openings for the eyes mouth and ears this miniature apartment benvenuto made when working at the head he used it as a receptacle for the tools he so that he need not be at the trouble of taking them up and or six times a day often too he carried up his lunch with him it out upon a table which stood in the centre of this room so that he had not to leave his scaffolding to take meal this innovation which was so convenient for him made attractive to him he followed up the table with a cot bed he had formed the habit of taking his noon day siesta in of his mars as well as of breakfasting there it was therefore that it should occur to him to ensconce colombe was clearly the most secure hiding place of all he could offer her this is where you must remain colombe said benvenuto and you up your mind to go down only after dark await here in under god s eye and our watchful care the result of jupiter he added with a smile alluding to the king will finish i trust what mars has begun you don but i know what i mean we have olympus on our side and paradise how can we not succeed come smile a little colombe the future at least if not for the present i tell you in that we have ground for hope hope therefore in god if not in me i have been in a sterner prison believe me and my hope made me indifferent to my captivity until the day that success crowns my efforts colombe you will no more your brother ascanio who is less suspected and less than i am will come to see you and will stand guard over you rely upon him to transform this workman s chamber into a nun s cell that i am about to leave you mark well and remember my words done all that you had to do trustful and courageous child concerns me we have now only to allow providence time to do colombe now listen whatever happens remember this your situation may seem to be or may really be even stand at the altar and have naught left to say but the terrible would unite you forever to comte d orbec do not doubt colombe do not doubt your father my child rely upon god us i will arrive in time i promise you will you have faith and resolution tell me yes said the girl confidently tis well said cellini adieu i leave you now in your solitude everybody is asleep ascanio will come and bring you what you need colombe held out his hand but colombe gave him her forehead to kiss as accustomed to do with her father benvenuto started but hand over his eyes he mastered the thoughts which came to his the passions which raged in his heart and deposited upon forehead the most paternal of kisses adieu dear child of stefana he whispered and went quickly down to ascanio with whom he joined the workmen who had but were drinking still new life a strange dream like life thereupon began for colombe accommodated herself to it as she would have done to the life of us see how the aerial chamber was furnished it had already as a bed and a table ascanio added a low velvet chair a a collection of religious books selected by colombe herself a marvellous piece of carving and a silver vase also master s hand which was filled every night with fresh flowers was room for nothing more in the white shell which contained of innocence and charm ordinarily slept during the day ascanio had advised that fear that if she were awake she might thoughtlessly do would betray her presence she awoke with the stars and s song knelt upon her bed in front of her crucifix for some time absorbed in fervent prayer then she made dressed her lovely luxuriant hair and sat and mused erelong would be placed against the statue and ascanio would knock at door if colombe s toilet was completed she would admit him would remain with her until midnight at midnight if the weather she would go down into the garden and ascanio would return to nesle for a few hours sleep while colombe took her nightly walk once more the old dreams she used to dream in her and which seemed now more likely to be fulfilled after about the white apparition would return to her snug retreat where wait for daylight and her bedtime inhaling the sweet odor of she had collected for her little nest and listening to of the nightingales in the petit nesle and the crowing of in the pré aux clercs before dawn ascanio would return to his beloved once more daily supply of provisions adroitly subtracted from dame ruperta by virtue of cellini s complicity then they would sit for conversing as only lovers can converse evoking memories of and forming plans for the future when they should be man and wife ascanio would sit silently contemplating colombe and meet his earnest gaze with her sweet smile often when they had not exchanged a single word but those were the occasions they said most had not each of them in his or her heart all other could have said in addition to what the heart cannot say reads and solitude have this advantage in youth that while they heart nobler and greater they preserve its freshness colombe dignified maiden was at the same time a light hearted so there were days when they laughed as well as days when days when they played together like children and thing of all those days or nights for as we have seen young people had inverted the order of nature were not the passed most quickly love like every other shining thing needs darkness to make its light shine the brighter did ascanio utter a word that could alarm the timid who called him brother they were alone and they loved but for the very reason that they were alone they were the of the presence of god whose heaven they saw nearer at hand for the very reason that they loved each other they respected as a divinity soon as the first rays of dawn began to cast a feeble light upon of the houses colombe regretfully sent her friend away him back as many times as juliet did romeo one or the other forgotten something of the greatest importance however they part at last and colombe up to the moment toward noon when her heart to god and slept the sleep of the angels would and dream listening to the voices whispering in her heart the little birds singing under the lindens in her old garden it saying that ascanio always carried the ladder away with him morning she strewed bread around the mouth of the statue for birds the bold faced little fellows would come and seize it quickly away again at first but they gradually grew tame to understand the hearts of young girls who are winged they finally would remain for a long while and would pay for the banquet with which colombe regaled them there was goldfinch who ventured within the room and finally habit of eating from colombe s hand at morning and evening when began to be a little cool one night he allowed himself to captive by the young prisoner who put him in her bosom and slept until morning notwithstanding ascanio s visit and colombe promenade after that the willing captive never failed to night at daybreak he would begin to sing colombe would then for ascanio to kiss and set him at liberty did colombe s days glide by in the head of the statue only occurred to disturb the tranquillity of her existence those were the provost s domiciliary visits once colombe awoke with at the sound of her father s voice it was no dream he was the garden beneath her and benvenuto was saying to him you this colossal figure is monsieur d estourville it is the mars which his majesty condescended to order for fontainebleau bauble sixty feet high as you see it is of noble proportions and very beautiful replied d estourville but let us go on this is not what i am in search of no it would be too easy to find they passed on kneeling with outstretched arms felt an intense longing to father father i am here the old man was seeking his child for her perhaps but the thought of comte d orbec the of madame d etampes and the memory of the conversation paralyzed her impulse and on the second visit the did not come to her when the voice of the odious count with the provost s there s a curious statue built just like a house said d orbec as at the foot of the colossus if it stands through the winter swallows will build their nests in it in the spring the morning of the day when the mere voice of her fiancé colombe ascanio had brought her a letter from cellini my child so ran the letter i am obliged to go away but have i leave everything prepared for your deliverance and the king s word guarantees my success and the king you never been false to his word from to day your father also will do not despair i have now had all the time that i needed i say to you again dear girl though you should be at door though you should be kneeling at the altar and on of uttering the words which bind you for life let things course providence will intervene in time i swear to you adieu your father benvenuto cellini letter which filled colombe s heart with joy by reviving had the unfortunate result of causing the poor children to feel sense of security youth is incapable of moderate feelings at one bound from despair to the fullest confidence in its sky is always black with tempests or resplendently clear doubly confident by the provost s absence and cellini s letter neglected their precautions and thought more of their love of prudence colombe was not so guarded in her movements and saw her but luckily mistook her for the monk s ghost the lamp without drawing the curtains and the light was seen ruperta the tales of the two gossips taken in conjunction curiosity of jacques aubry and the indiscreet student like the école des femmes revealed everything to the very person he should have revealed absolutely nothing we know the result disclosures us now return to the hôtel d etampes marmagne was asked how he had stumbled upon his valuable discovery assumed an air of mystery and refused to tell the truth was and did not reflect sufficient credit upon his penetration to let it be understood that he had arrived at the which aroused their wonder by dint of strategy and perseverance duchess was radiant she went and came and plied the viscount so they had her at last the little rebel who had all madame d etampes determined to go in person to the hôtel to make sure of her friend s good fortune moreover after happened after the flight or rather the abduction of colombe must not be left at the petit nesle the duchess would take her she would take her to the hôtel d etampes and would keep watch upon her than duenna and fiancé together had done keep watch upon her as a rival so that colombe would surely guarded duchess ordered her litter the affair has been kept very secret said she to the provost you orbec are not the man to worry about a childish escapade of i don t see then what is to prevent the marriage from and our plans from being carried out on the same conditions of course duchess said d orbec to be sure on the same conditions my dear count as to benvenuto the duchess who is guilty either as principal or accessory an infamous abduction never fear dear viscount we will while avenging ourselves but i understand madame rejoined marmagne that the king in enthusiasm had made him a solemn promise in case the statue jupiter should be cast successfully so that he will simply have a wish to see his wish gratified never fear that s just where i will watch rejoined the duchess prepare a surprise for him on that day that will be a so rely upon me and let me manage everything was in truth the best thing they could do not for a long while duchess seemed so eager so animated so charming her in spite of her she sent the provost away in hot haste his archers and erelong that functionary accompanied by d marmagne and preceded by a number of subordinates arrived at of the hôtel de nesle followed at a short distance by etampes who waited upon the quay trembling with impatience thrusting her head out of the litter was the dinner hour of the workmen and ascanio pagolo and the women were the only occupants of the grand nesle at benvenuto was not expected until the evening of the or the morning of the day following that ascanio who received supposed that it was a third domiciliary visit and as he positive orders from the master on that subject he offered but welcomed them on the other hand most courteously provost his friends and his retainers went straight to open this door for us said d estourville to ascanio young man s heart was oppressed with a terrible presentiment he might be mistaken and as the least hesitation might he handed the provost the key without moving a muscle take that long ladder said the provost to his archers obeyed and under messire d estourville s guidance marched the statue there the provost himself put the ladder in place to ascend but ascanio pale with terror and wrath placed on the first round what is your purpose messieurs he cried this statue is s masterpiece it has been placed in my charge and the first lays hand upon it for any purpose whatsoever is a dead man i drew from his belt a keen edged slender dagger of such that it would cut through a gold crown at a single blow provost gave a signal and his archers advanced upon ascanio pike he made a desperate resistance and wounded two men but he nothing alone against eight leaving the provost marmagne orbec out of the reckoning he was forced to yield to he was thrown down bound and gagged and the provost the ladder followed by two sergeants for fear of a surprise had heard and seen everything her father found her in a swoon when she saw ascanio fall she believed him to be dead to anger rather than anxiety by this sight the provost roughly over his broad shoulders and descended the ladder party then returned to the quay the archers escorting ascanio d orbec gazed most earnestly pagolo saw his comrade pass and stir little jehan had disappeared scozzone alone of what had taken place tried to bar the door crying what means this violence messieurs why are you taking ascanio away is this woman at that moment the veil which covered colombe s face fell off recognized the model for the statue of hebe she stood aside pale with jealousy and allowed the his people as well as their prisoners to pass without what does this mean and why have you abused this boy so d etampes when she saw ascanio bound and pale and covered unbind him unbind him madame said the provost this same boy resisted us desperately two of my men he is his master s accomplice without doubt seems to me advisable to take him to some safe place and furthermore said d orbec in an undertone to the duchess he resembles the italian page i saw at your reception and who throughout our conversation that if he were not and if i had not heard him speak the language which me the page could not understand upon my honor madame i would swear it was he you are right monsieur le prévôt said madame d etampes hastily better of the order she had given to set ascanio at liberty you are right this young man may be dangerous make sure of to the châtelet with the prisoner said the provost and we said the duchess at whose side colombe still unconscious been placed we messieurs will return to the hôtel d etampes moment later the hoof beats of a galloping horse rang out upon it was little jehan riding off at full speed to tell had taken place at the hôtel de nesle meanwhile was committed to the châtelet without having duchess and in ignorance of the part played by her in the destroyed his hopes d etampes who had been so desirous to see colombe at ever since she had first heard of her had her heart s last the poor child lay there before her in a swoon jealous duchess did not once cease to gaze at her throughout journey to the hôtel d etampes her eyes blazing with anger saw how beautiful she was scrutinized each of her charms feature and passed in review one after another all the went to make up the perfect beauty of the pale cheeked girl at last in her power and under her hand the two women who with the same passion and disputing possession of the were face to face at last one all powerful and malevolent weak but beloved one with her splendor the other with one with her passion the other with her innocence separated many obstacles they had finally come roughly in contact and s velvet robe brushed against colombe s simple white gown colombe was in a swoon anne was not the least pale of the two her mute contemplation of her companion s loveliness pride to despair and destroyed her hopes for while in her she murmured they told me truly she is lovely very lovely hand which held colombe s pressed it so convulsively that girl was brought to her senses by the pain and opened her saying oh madame you hurt me soon as the duchess saw that colombe s eyes were open she let fall but the consciousness of pain preceded the return of of thought for some seconds after she uttered the words to gaze wonderingly at the duchess as if she could her thoughts who are you madame she said at last and whither are you then she suddenly drew away from her crying ah you are the duchesse d etampes i remember i remember hush returned anne imperiously hush soon we shall be alone can wonder and cry out at your ease words were accompanied by a stern haughty glance but it was of her own dignity and not the glance which imposed silence she said not another word until they reached the etampes where at a sign from the duchess she followed her to the rivals were at last alone and face to face they eyed for one or two minutes without speaking but with very colombe was calm for her trust in providence and sustained her anne was furious at her calmness but fury was clearly evidenced by the contortion of her features not give expression to it for she relied upon her imperious will her unbounded power to crush the feeble creature before her she first to break the silence well my young friend she said in a tone which left no doubt as bitterness of the thought although the words were soft you to your father at last it is well but allow me first of compliment you upon your courage you are bold for your age i have god on my side madame rejoined colombe simply what god do you refer to mademoiselle oh the god mars of course the duchess with one of those impertinent winks which she had occasion to resort to at court i know but one god madame the eternal god merciful and protecting teaches charity in prosperity and humility in grandeur woe to know not the god of whom i speak for there will come a day when not know them very good mademoiselle very good said the duchess the admirably adapted for a moral lecture and i would congratulate your happy choice of a subject if i did not prefer to think are trying to excuse your wantonness by impudence in truth madame replied colombe without bitterness but with shrug of the shoulders i do not seek to excuse myself to you i am as yet ignorant of any right on your part to accuse me my father chooses to question me i shall reply with respect if he reproves me i will try to justify myself but until then la duchesse permit me to hold my peace i understand that my voice annoys you and you would prefer would to remain alone with your thoughts and think at leisure of the love no noise however annoying it may be can prevent me from thinking madame especially when he is unhappy you dare confess that you love him that is the difference between us madame you love him and dare it impudent hussy cried the duchess upon my word i believe she alas no replied colombe softly i do not defy you i reply you force me to reply leave me alone with my thoughts and leave you alone with your schemes very good since you drive me to it child since you imagine that strong enough to contend with me since you confess your love confess mine but at the same time i will confess my hatred yes love ascanio and i hate you after all why should i dissemble the only person to whom i may say whatever i choose for you only one who whatever you say will not be believed yes i in that case i pity you madame rejoined colombe softly for me yes it is true ascanio does love you but by seduction if i can if i must by a crime if it becomes necessary i will love away from you mark that i am anne d heilly etampes ascanio madame will love the one who loves him best in god s name hear her cried the duchess exasperated by such would not one think that her love is unique and that love can be compared to it i do not say that madame for the reason that i love i know hearts may love as i do but i doubt if yours is one of them what would you do for him come let us see you who boast of this yours which mine can never equal what have you sacrificed for far an obscure life and wearisome solitude no madame but my peace of mind you have given him preference over what comte d orbec s absurd love no madame but my filial obedience what have you to give him can you make him rich powerful feared no madame but i hope to make him happy ah exclaimed the duchess it s a very different matter with me do much more for him i sacrifice a king s affection i lay wealth and honors at his feet i bring him a kingdom to govern yes said colombe with a smile it s true that your love gives that is not love enough enough of this insulting comparison cried the feeling that she was losing ground step by step ensued a momentary pause during which colombe seemed to embarrassment while madame d etampes succeeded in concealing by revealing her anger however her features gradually relaxed faee assumed a milder expression lightened by a gleam of real benevolence she was the first to reopen the conflict which not propose should end otherwise than in a triumph let us see colombe said she in a tone that was almost affectionate if some one should bid you sacrifice your life for him what would ah i would give it to him blissfully and so would i cried the duchess with an accent which proved of her passion if not the sincerity of the sacrifice but your honor she continued would you sacrifice that as well life if by my honor you mean my reputation yes if by my honor you mean no what you do not belong to him is he not your lover he is my fiancé madame that is all oh she doesn t love him rejoined the duchess she doesn t she prefers her honor a mere empty word to him if some one were to say to you madame retorted colombe angered of her sweet disposition if some one were to say to you renounce for his sake your titles and your grandeur abandon the him not in secret that would be too easy but publicly if were to say to you anne d heilly duchesse d etampes leave your luxurious surroundings and your courtiers for his s studio i would refuse in his own interest replied the duchess as if it to say what was false beneath the profound penetrating her rival you would refuse yes ah she doesn t love him cried colombe she prefers honors to him but when i tell you that i wish to retain my position for his sake the duchess exasperated anew by this fresh triumph of when i tell you that i wish to retain my honors so that he them all men care for them sooner or later yes replied colombe smiling but ascanio is not one of them hush cried anne stamping her foot in passion had the cunning and powerful duchess signally failed to gain hand over a mere girl whom she expected to intimidate simply her voice to her questions angry or satirical colombe answer with a modest tranquillity which disconcerted her that the blind impulsion of her hatred had led her astray changed her tactics to tell the truth she had not reckoned possession of so much beauty or so much wit by her rival and that she could not bend her she determined to take her as we have seen was not alarmed by the double explosion d etampes s wrath but simply took refuge in cold and the duchess however following out the new plan she now approached her with her most fascinating smile and affectionately by the hand forgive me my child she said but i fear i lost my temper you bear me ill will for it you have the advantage of me in so that it s natural that i should be jealous alas you no doubt everybody else consider me a wicked woman but in truth is at fault not i forgive me therefore because we to love ascanio is no reason why we should hate each other he loves you alone so t is your duty to be indulgent let us what say you let us talk frankly together and i will try from your mind the unfortunate impression which my foolish have left there madame said colombe with reserve and withdrawing her hand with movement of repulsion but she added at once speak i oh said madame d etampes playfully and as if she her companion s reserve have no fear little savage i ask for your friendship without a guaranty in order that you what manner of woman i am that you may know me as i know myself to tell you in two words the story of my life my heart to do with my story and we poor women who are called are so often slandered ah envy does very wrong to speak ill when we are fitter subjects for compassion for instance what judgment of me my child be frank you look upon me as a do you not made a gesture indicative of the embarrassment she felt at of replying to such a question but if i am a lost woman is it my fault you in your happiness must not be too hard upon those who have suffered you lived hitherto in innocent solitude and do not know what it is reared upon ambitious dreams for they who are destined to like victims decked out with flowers see only the bright life there is no question of love simply of pleading so it from my earliest youth my thoughts were all bent upon king the beauty which god gives to woman to be exchanged for i was forced to exchange for a title they made of my charms tell me now colombe what could be the fate of a poor child in hand before she has learned to know the difference between evil and who is told the good is evil the evil is good and so see although others despair of me i do not despair of myself god will forgive me for no one stood beside me to tell me what was there for me to do alone as i was and weak craft and deceit have made up my whole life from that and yet i was not made to play such a hideous rôle the proof i love ascanio and that when i found that i loved him i was ashamed at the same time now tell me my pure darling child understand me yes innocently replied colombe deceived by this false good faith lie masquerading in the guise of truth then you will have pity on me cried the duchess you will let ascanio from a distance all by myself hopelessly and in that shall not be your rival for he will not care for me and in return who know the world and its snares its pitfalls and deceit will place of the mother you have lost i will guide you i will now you see that you can trust me for you save my life a child heart the passions of a woman were sown that in brief is my past present you see for yourself it is the shame of being the of a king my future is my love for ascanio not his for me as you have said and as i have very often told myself never love me but for the very reason that love will it will purify me now it is your turn to speak to open to tell me everything tell me your story dear girl my story madame is very brief and very simple said colombe it be summed up in three loves i have loved i love and i god my father and ascanio but in the past my love for ascanio i had not then met was a dream at present it is a cause in the future it is a hope very good said the duchess restraining her jealousy and her tears but do not half confide in me colombe what do to do now how can you poor child contend with two such as your father s and comte d orbec s to say nothing of the king seen you and fallen in love with you o mon dieu murmured colombe but as this passion on the king s part was the work of the etampes your rival your friend anne d heilly will deliver you so we won t disturb ourselves about the king but your father count must be reckoned with their ambition is less easy to the commonplace fancy of the king oh do not be half kind cried colombe save me from the others as from the king i know but one way said madame d etampes seeming to reflect what is that you will take fright and refuse to adopt it oh if only courage is required tell me what it is come here and listen to me said the duchess affectionately to a seat upon a stool beside her arm chair and passing her her waist don t be alarmed i beg at the first words i say is it very terrifying colombe asked your virtue is unbending and unspotted my dear little one but alas at a time and in a society where such fascinating but a danger the more for it places you without means of defence the mercy of your enemies whom you cannot fight with the use to attack you so make an effort descend from the heights your dreams have transported you to the lower level of reality said just now that you would sacrifice your reputation for ascanio do not ask so much as that but simply that you sacrifice of fidelity to him it is pure madness for you alone to struggle against your destiny for you the daughter of to dream of marriage with a goldsmith s apprentice come the advice of a sincere friend do not resist them but let their way remain at heart the spotless fiancé the wife and give your hand to comte d orbec his ambitious that you should bear his name but once you are orbec you can easily overturn his detestable schemes for you to raise your voice and complain whereas now who would take in the contest no one even i cannot assist you against authority of a father while if it were a question your husband s combinations you would soon see me at work upon what i say to remain your own mistress obey to pretend to abandon your liberty strong in the thought is your lawful husband and that union with any other is you may do what your heart bids you and your conscience at rest while the world in whose eyes appearances will will take your part madame madame murmured colombe rising and straightening the duchess s arm as she sought to detain her i am not i understand you aright but it seems to me that you are to do an infamous thing what do you say cried the duchess i say that virtue is not so subtle as all that madame i say that make me blush for you i say that beneath the cloak with which you conceal your hatred i see the net you for me you wish to dishonor me in ascanio s eyes do you not you know that ascanio will never love or will cease to love he despises well yes said the duchess bursting forth at last i am weary a mask ah you will not fall into the net i have spread very good then you will fall into the abyss i will push you into this whether you will or no you shall marry d orbec in that case the force put upon me will be my excuse and by yielding i do yield i shall not have profaned my heart s religion pray do you mean to resist by every means in the power of a poor girl i warn you that i will to the end you may put my hand in that man s i will say no drag me before the altar i will say no you may force me to the priest s feet and to the priest s face i will say no what matters it ascanio will believe that you have consented to that is forced upon you for that reason i hope i may not have to submit to it madame upon whom do you rely to come to your assistance upon god above and upon a man on earth but the man is a prisoner the man is free madame why who is the man i pray to know benvenuto cellini duchess ground her teeth when she heard the name of the man her deadliest foe but as she was on the point of name accompanied by some terrible imprecation a page raised and announced the king that announcement she darted from the room to meet françois i smile upon her lips and led him to her own apartments motioning people to keep watch upon colombe at hour after the imprisonment of ascanio and the abduction of colombe cellini rode along the quai des augustins at a footpace just parted from the king and the court whom he had the journey by innumerable tales told as he only could mingled with anecdotes of his own adventures but when he was alone he became thoughtful and abstracted the frivolous place to the profound dreamer while his hand shook the rein was busily at work he dreamed of the casting of his jupiter depended his dear ascanio s happiness as well as his the bronze was fermenting in his brain before being melted in outwardly he was calm he reached the door of the hôtel de nesle he stopped for a moment not to hear the sound of hammering the blackened walls of were mute and gloomy as if no living thing were within master rapped without obtaining a reply at the third opened the door ah there you are master she cried when she saw that it alas why did you not return two hours earlier what has happened in god s name demanded cellini the provost comte d orbec and the duchesse d etampes have been here well they made a search and then they found colombe in the head of the statue of mars impossible the duchesse d etampes carried colombe home with her and the ascanio to be taken to the châtelet ah we have been betrayed cried benvenuto striking his hand forehead and stamping upon the ground as his first thought on was of vengeance he left his horse to find his own way to and darted into the studio come hither all of you he cried all each one had to undergo an examination in due form but all equally ignorant not only of colombe s hiding place but means by which her enemies had succeeded in discovering it not a single one including pagolo upon whom the master s first of all who did not exculpate himself in a way that left in benvenuto s mind it is needless to say that he did not for suspect hermann and simon le gaucher for no more than he became convinced that he could learn nothing in that direction with the rapidity of decision which was usual with him his mind what course to pursue and having made sure that his at his side and that his dagger moved easily in its sheath everybody to remain at home in order to be at hand in case he then left the studio and hurried across the courtyard into features his gait and his every movement bore the stamp excitement a thousand thoughts a thousand schemes a reflections were jostling one another confusedly in his head failed him at the moment when his presence was most essential all his apprentices with the most intelligent of them all at were none too many for the casting of his jupiter colombe and colombe in the midst of her foes might lose heart sublime confidence which served the poor child as a evil thoughts and perverse designs would perhaps grow weaker her altogether in such a maze of plots and threats with rest he remembered that one day he had spoken to ascanio of of some cruel vengeance on the part of the etampes whereupon ascanio replied with a smile she will not dare to ruin me for with a word i could ruin her sought to learn the secret but ascanio would make no to his questions than this to day it would be treachery master wait until the day comes when be only a legitimate means of defence understood the delicacy which closed his mouth and waited it was necessary that he should see ascanio and his first be directed to that end benvenuto the wish led at once to the decision necessarily it he had hardly said to himself that he must see ascanio he was knocking at the door of the châtelet the wicket opened one of the provost s people asked cellini who he was another standing behind him in the shadow my name is benvenuto cellini replied the goldsmith what do you wish to see a prisoner who is confined herein what is his name ascanio ascanio is in secret and can see no one why is he in secret because he is charged with a crime punishable with death an additional reason why i should see him cried benvenuto your logic is most extraordinary signor cellini said the man who in the background in a jeering tone and doesn t at the châtelet who laughs when i proffer a request who jeers when i implore a favor benvenuto i said the voice i robert d estourville provost of paris his turn signor cellini every contest consists of a game you won the first bout and the second is mine you my property i legally take your apprentice you refused to one to me so never fear i will not return the other to you gallant and enterprising you have an army of devoted retainers on my stormer of citadels come on my scaler of walls come on burster in of doors come and take the châtelet i am waiting that the wicket was closed with a roar darted at the massive iron door but could impression upon it with the united efforts of his feet and hands come on my friend come on strike strike cried the provost other side of the door you will only succeed in making a noise if you make too much beware the watch beware the archers ah isn t like the hôtel de nesle you ll find it belongs lord the king and we shall see if you are more powerful in the king cast his eyes about and saw upon the quay an stone which two ordinary men would have found difficulty he walked to where it lay picked it up and put it on as easily as a child could do the same with a pebble he but a step or two however when he reflected that when the broken in he should find the guard waiting for him and the be that he should himself be imprisoned imprisoned s liberty was dependent upon his own he therefore dropped which was driven some inches into the ground by its own weight the provost was watching him from some invisible loophole heard a burst of laughter hurried away at full speed lest he should yield to the dash his head against the accursed door went directly to the hôtel d etampes was not lost if failing to see ascanio he could see colombe ascanio in the overflowing of his heart had confided to the secret he had refused to confide to his master went well at first the gateway of the mansion was open he courtyard and entered the reception room where stood a tall lace on all the seams of his livery a sort of colossus four and six high who are you he demanded eying the goldsmith from head to foot another time benvenuto would have answered his insolent stare by his customary violent outbursts but it was essential that he colombe ascanio s welfare was at stake so he restrained himself i am benvenuto cellini the florentine goldsmith he replied what do you wish to see mademoiselle colombe mademoiselle colombe is not visible why is she not visible because her father messire d estourville provost of paris gave charge to madame d etampes and requested her to keep an eye but i am a friend an additional reason for suspecting you i tell you that i must see her said benvenuto beginning to get warm and i tell you that you shall not see her retorted the servant is madame d etampes visible no more than mademoiselle colombe not even to me her jeweller less to you than to any other person do you mean that orders have been given not to admit me just so replied the servant you have put your finger on the spot do you know that i am a strange man my friend said benvenuto terrible laugh which ordinarily preceded his outbursts of wrath and that the place i am forbidden to enter is the place i am enter how will you do it eh you amuse me when there is a door and a blackguard like you in front of it well said the valet well retorted benvenuto suiting the action to the word i blackguard and break in the door with a blow of his fist he laid the valet sprawling on the floor burst in the door with a blow of his foot help cried the servant help the poor devil s cry of distress was not needed as benvenuto the reception room he found himself confronted by six others stationed there to receive him he at once divined that etampes had been informed of his return and had taken any other circumstances armed as he was with dagger and sword would have fallen upon them and would probably have given account of himself but such an act of violence in the abode of s mistress might have deplorable results for the second time to his custom common sense carried the day over wrath and certain that he could at all events have audience of the king presence as we know he had the privilege of being admitted hour he replaced his sword already half drawn in its scabbard his steps pausing at every movement in his rear like a retreat walked slowly across the courtyard and bent his the louvre once more assumed a calm demeanor and walked with but his tranquillity was only apparent great drops were rolling down his cheeks and his wrath was high within his breast his superhuman efforts to master him suffer the more indeed nothing could be more to his impulsive nature than delay than the of a closed door or the vulgar insolence of a lackey who command their thoughts are never so near despair as when in collision with some material obstacle and struggle to no surmount it benvenuto would have given ten years of his life to man jostle him and as he walked along he raised his head from time and gazed threateningly at those who passed as if he isn t there some unfortunate wretch among you who is tired of life let him apply to me i m his man quarter of an hour later he reached the louvre and went at once to set apart for the pages requesting immediate speech of it was his purpose to tell françois the whole story and appeal to his loyalty and if he could not obtain ascanio s release solicit permission to see him as he came through the streets what language he would use to the king and as he had to eloquence he was well content with the little speech prepared the excitement the terrible news he had learned the insults heaped upon him the obstacles he could all these had combined to set the blood on fire in artist s veins his temples throbbed his heart beat quickly hands shook he did not himself know the extent of the which multiplied the energy of his body and his heart a is sometimes concentrated in one minute such a frame of mind was benvenuto when he appealed to a page to the king s apartments the king is not visible was the young man s reply do you not recognize me asked benvenuto in surprise perfectly i am benvenuto cellini and his majesty is always visible to me it is precisely because you are benvenuto cellini returned the page that you cannot enter was thunderstruck ah is it you m de termes continued the page addressing a arrived just behind the goldsmith pass in pass in comte de pass in marquis des prés and what of me what of me pray cried benvenuto turning white you the king when he returned ten minutes since said if florentine makes his appearance let him know that i do to receive him and advise him to be submissive unless he make a comparison between the castle of san angelo and help me patience oh help me muttered benvenuto in a hollow voice vrai dieu i am not accustomed to being made to wait by kings s no less a place than the louvre and leo x is no less great than françois i and yet i was not kept waiting at the door of nor at that of leo x but i understand it s like this was with madame d etampes yes the king has just come from and has been put on his guard by her against me yes that way it is patience for ascanio patience for colombe his praiseworthy resolution to be patient however was obliged to lean against a pillar for support his swollen to bursting and his legs trembled under him this not only wounded him in his pride but in his friendship was filled with bitterness and despair and his clenched hands and his tightly closed lips bore witness to the violence of in a moment or two he recovered himself tossed back the was falling over his brow and left the palace with firm step all who were present watched him with something very as he walked away s apparent tranquillity was due to the marvellous power over himself for he was in reality more confused than a stag at bay he wandered through the streets for heedless as to where he might be hearing nothing but the the blood in his ears and vaguely wondering as one does whether he was awake or asleep it was the third time been shown the door within an hour it was the third time that been shut in his face in his face benvenuto s the favorite popes and kings before whom all doors were thrown open fullest extent when his footsteps were heard approaching and yet this threefold affront he had not the right to give his anger he must dissemble and hide his humiliation until he colombe and ascanio the throng through which he passed or full of business seemed to him to read upon his brow of the repeated insults he had undergone it was perhaps the in his whole life when his great heart lost faith in itself ten or fifteen minutes of this aimless blind wandering his itself and he raised his head his depression left him fever returned go to he cried aloud to such a degree did his mind dominate go to in vain do they crowd the man they cannot throw down come sculptor and make them repent of their base deeds admire thy handiwork come jupiter and prove that thou art still the king of the gods alone but the master of mankind he spoke benvenuto acting upon an impulse stronger than himself his step toward the tournelles that former royal residence old constable anne de montmorency still dwelt effervescent artist was required to await his turn for an he was admitted to the presence of the warrior minister i who was besieged by a mob of courtiers and petitioners he was introduced de montmorency was a man of great height little if any bent cold stiff and spare with a piercing glance and an abrupt speaking he was forever scolding and no one ever saw him in he would have looked upon it as a humiliation to be a laugh upon his face how had this morose old man succeeded himself agreeable to the amiable and gracious prince who france it is something that can be explained in no other by the law of contrasts françois i had a way of sending those whose petitions he refused the constable on the arranged matters in such a way that those whom he gratified in a rage he was only moderately endowed in the way of genius won the king s confidence by his military inflexibility and gravity benvenuto entered montmorency was as usual striding back in his apartment he nodded in response to the goldsmith then paused in his walk and fixing his piercing gaze inquired who are you benvenuto cellini your profession goldsmith to the king replied the artist wondering to find that reply did not make the second question unnecessary ah yes yes growled the constable i recognize you well what want what have you to ask my friend that i give you an order have counted on that your time is thrown away i give you warning my word i have no patience with this mania for art which is everywhere to day one would say it was an epidemic that has one except myself no sculpture doesn t interest me in the master goldsmith do you hear so apply to others and made a gesture but before he could speak the mon dieu don t let that discourage you you will find plenty who like to ape the king and noodles who pose as for me hark ye i stick to my trade which is to and i tell you frankly that i much prefer a good woman who gives me a child that is to say a soldier months than a wretched sculptor who wastes his time turning out of men of bronze who are good for nothing but to raise the cannon monseigneur said benvenuto who had listened to this long with a degree of patience which amazed himself i am not speak upon artistic subjects but upon a matter of honor ah that s a different matter what do you desire of me tell do you remember monseigneur that his majesty once said to me in that on the day when i should bring him the statue of in bronze he would grant whatever favor i might ask and that you monseigneur and chancelier poyet remind him of his promise event of his forgetting it i remember what then the moment is at hand monseigneur when i shall implore you to memory for the king will you do it is that what you come here to ask me monsieur cried the constable have you intruded upon me to beg me to do something i am bound to do monseigneur you re an impertinent fellow master goldsmith understand that anne de montmorency does not need to be reminded to be man the king bade me remember for him and that is he might well take more frequently with all due respect do as he bade me even though the reminder be annoying to him master cellini and make room for others that the constable turned his back on benvenuto and gave for another petitioner to be introduced saluted the constable whose somewhat brutal frankness was to him and took his leave still agitated and impelled same feverish excitement and the same burning thoughts he to the abode of chancelier poyet near porte saint antoine short distance away poyet formed a most striking and complete contrast moral to anne de montmorency who was always crabbed and in armor from head to foot he was polished shrewd crafty in his furs lost so to speak in the ermine naught could of him save a bald head surrounded by a grizzly fringe of hair restless eyes thin lips and a white hand he was quite perhaps as the constable but much less outspoken again benvenuto was forced to wait for half an hour but would not have recognized him he had accustomed himself monseigneur he said when he was at last ushered into s presence i have come to remind you of a promise the me in your presence and constituted you not only the but the guarantor i know what you refer to messire benvenuto said poyet and i if you wish to bring his majesty s promise to his mind but my duty to inform you that from a legal standpoint you have upon him for an undertaking indefinite in form and left to cannot be enforced before the courts and never affords of action wherefore if the king satisfies your demand he so purely as a matter of generosity and good faith that is as i understand it monseigneur said benvenuto and i to request you when the occasion arises to fulfil the duty intrusted to you leaving the rest to his good will very well said poyet i am at your service my dear monsieur extent thereupon took his leave of the chancellor with his mind ease but his blood was still boiling and his hands were fever his thoughts excited by the annoyance and irritation to which he had been subjected burst forth at last in after their long restraint space and time no longer the mind which they overflowed and as benvenuto strode along home he saw in a sort of luminous dream del moro s house stefana castle of san angelo and colombe s garden at the same time that his strength became more than human and he seemed to in another world was still laboring under this intense exaltation of feeling when the hôtel de nesle all the apprentices were awaiting in accordance with his commands how for the casting of the jupiter my children he cried from and darted into the studio good morning master said jacques aubry who had come in singing joyously as his wont was you neither saw nor did you for five minutes i have been following you along the quay you you walked so fast that i am quite out of breath in god what s the matter with you all you are as sober as judges to the casting continued benvenuto without answering aubry had seen him out of the corner of his eye and listened to him ear to the casting everything depends upon that merciful god we be successful ah my friend he continued abruptly aubry ah my dear jacques what sad news awaited me on and what a cruel advantage they took of my absence what is the matter master cried aubry really disturbed by cellini and the dejection of the apprentices above all things boys throw in plenty of dry spruce you know that been laying in a stock of it for six months the matter my is that ascanio is under lock and key at the châtelet colombe the provost s daughter that lovely girl whom as you know is in the hands of the duchesse d etampes they found her in the statue of mars where i had hidden her will rescue them well well where are you going hermann s in the yard not in the cellar ascanio arrested cried aubry colombe carried off yes yes some villanous spy must have watched them poor children a secret which i had kept even from you dear jacques but discover the knave to the casting boys to the casting that isn the king refuses to see me whom he called his friend so much friendship of men to be sure kings are not men but kings was that i went to the louvre to no purpose i could not of him ah but my statue shall speak for me prepare the mould friends and let us not lose a moment that woman insulting that infamous provost jeering at me that jailer oh i have had some fearful visions to day dear jacques give ten years of my life to the man who could gain admission prisoner speak to him and learn the secret by means of which i that arrogant duchess for ascanio knows a secret which power jacques and refused to divulge it to me noble heart matter have no fear for thy child stefana i will defend him to breath and i will save him yes i will save him ah where vile traitor who betrayed us that i may strangle him with my let me live but three days stefana for it seems to me that which consumes me is burning my life away oh if i should my jupiter is finished to the casting children to benvenuto s first words jacques aubry became pale as death for that he was the cause of it all as the master proceeded was changed to certainty thereupon some plan itself to him for he stole silently away while away to the foundry followed by his workmen and shouting madman to the casting children to the casting the difficulty which an honest man procuring his own jacques aubry was in a frame of mind bordering on despair when the grand nesle there could be no doubt that it was he who to be sure had betrayed ascanio s secret but who was who had betrayed him surely not that gallant nobleman whose name not know ah no he was a gentleman it must have been that a henriot unless it was robin or chariot or guillaume to tell poor aubry rather lost himself in his conjectures for the that he had intrusted the secret to a dozen or more among whom it was no easy matter to find the culprit but the first the real traitor was himself jacques aubry spy so roundly denounced by benvenuto was himself instead away in his heart his friend s secret which he had surprised spread it broadcast in a score of places and had brought his brother ascanio with his infernal tongue jacques tore jacques beat himself with his fists jacques heaped mortal himself and could find no invectives sufficiently bitter his conduct as it deserved remorse became so keen and threw him into such a state with himself that for the first time in his life perhaps aubry indulged in reflection after all when his head should his chest black and blue and his conscience torn to rags be no nearer freedom at any cost he must repair the evil he instead of wasting his time in despairing jacques had retained these words of benvenuto i would give of my life to the man who would gain admission to the prisoner to him and learn the secret by means of which i may subdue duchess and as we have said he began to reflect his wont the result of his reflections was that he must to the châtelet once there he would find a way to benvenuto had sought in vain to gain admission as a visitor jacques aubry could never be so audacious as to think a thing in which the master had failed however although be impossible to effect an entrance as a visitor it be much easier at least so the student thought to be a prisoner he determined therefore to enter the châtelet in then when he had seen ascanio and ascanio had told him all that he had no further business at the châtelet he would take rich in the possession of the precious secret and would go not to demand the ten years of his life that he offered confess his crime and implore forgiveness with the fecundity of his imagination and proud of devotion he bent his steps toward the châtelet let us see he ruminated as he walked with deliberate step toward where all his hopes were centred let us see in order to more idiotic mistakes how matters stand no easy task the whole business seems to me as tangled as gervaise s skein gives it to me to hold and i try to kiss her let s begin at ascanio loved colombe the provost s daughter so far as the provost proposed to marry her to comte d orbec her off very good not knowing what to do with the sweet he had abducted her he hid her in the head of the statue of mars of all faith it was a wonderfully ingenious hiding place less than a beast but let us pass over that i shall again later thereupon it would seem that the provost my information got his daughter into his clutches once more ascanio triple brute that i am but here is where the to be tangled what interest has the duchesse d etampes in she detests colombe whom everybody else loves why ah i know remember certain jocose remarks of the apprentices ascanio when the duchess was mentioned madame d etampes has on ascanio and naturally abominates her rival jacques my friend are a miserable wretch but you are a clever dog all the same ah but now how does it happen that ascanio has in his hands the ruining the duchess why does the king appear at intervals in with one stefana why did benvenuto constantly invoke jupiter a heathenish invocation for a catholic deuce take me if i through all that but it isn t absolutely necessary that i light is to be found in ascanio s cell therefore the thing is to get myself cast into the cell with him i the rest afterward he thus communed with himself he reached his destination and violent blow upon the great door of the châtelet the wicket opened a harsh voice demanded to know his business it was the jailer s i wish for a cell in your prison replied aubry in a hollow voice a cell exclaimed the astonished jailer yes a cell the blackest and deepest even that will be better than why so because i am a great criminal what crime have you committed ah indeed what crime have i committed jacques asked himself for not thought of preparing a crime suited to the occasion as lively imagination was not his most prominent characteristic the compliments he had addressed to himself just before repeated stupidly what crime yes what crime guess said jacques this fellow ought to know more about crimes do he added to himself so i will let him give me a list and my selection have you murdered anybody asked the jailer great god what do you take me for my friend cried the student conscience rose in revolt at the thought of being taken for have you stolen anything continued the jailer stolen the idea what in heaven s name have you done then cried the jailer testily to give yourself up as a criminal isn t all that is necessary say what crime you ve committed but i tell you that i m a villain a vile wretch and that i wheel or the gallows the crime the crime the jailer repeated the crime well i have betrayed my friend that s no crime said the jailer good night and he closed that s not a crime you say that s not a crime what is it then jacques grasped the knocker with both hands and knocked with strength what s the matter what s the matter said a different voice the châtelet it s a madman who wants to be admitted into the prison replied if he s a madman his place is not at the châtelet but at at the asylum cried aubry scampering away as fast as his legs him at the asylum peste that s not what i want i want to the châtelet not the asylum besides paupers and beggars to the asylum and not people who have twenty paris sous in as i have the asylum why that wretched jailer claims that one s friend is no crime so it seems that in order to have of being committed to prison one must have murdered or stolen i think of it why might i not have led some young girl astray s nothing dishonorable about that very good but what girl his preoccupation the student roared with laughter but after all he said though it isn t so it might have been good i have discovered my crime i seduced gervaise the instant he set off for the young working girl s home ran up stairs which led to her lodgings and burst into the room lovely grisette in a coquettish négligé was ironing her linen ah exclaimed gervaise with a fascinating little shriek ah you frightened me gervaise my dear gervaise cried aubry rushing toward her with you must save my life my child one moment one moment said gervaise using the hot flat iron as what do you want master gadabout for three days i haven you i have done wrong gervaise i am an unfortunate wretch but a that i love you is that i run to you in my distress i repeat it you must save my life yes i understand you have been getting tipsy in some wine shop had a dispute with some one the archers are after you to put prison and you come to poor gervaise to give you shelter go monsieur go to prison and leave me in peace that is just what i ask and all i ask my little gervaise to go but the villains refuse to commit me o mon dieu jacques said the young woman compassionately have mad there you are they say that i am mad and propose to send me to while the châtelet is where i want to go you want to go to the châtelet what for aubry the châtelet s prison they say that when one gets in there it s say when one will come out i must get in there however i must cried the student there is way to save him to save whom ascanio ascanio what that handsome young fellow your benvenuto s pupil himself gervaise he is in the châtelet and he s there by my fault great god so that i must join him there said jacques and save him why is he in the châtelet because he loved the provost s daughter and seduced her poor boy why do they imprison men for that yes gervaise how you see it was like this he had her in hiding the hiding place and like an idiot like an i told the whole story to everybody except me cried gervaise that was just like you didn t i tell it to you gervaise you didn t mention it you re a great babbler with others but me when you come here it s to kiss me to drink or never to talk understand monsieur that a woman loves well what are we doing at this moment my little gervaise we are talking i should say yes because you need me it is true that you could do me a great service what is it you could say that i seduced you why of course you seduced me you wretch i cried jacques in amazement i seduced you gervaise alas yes that is the word seduced monsieur shamelessly seduced fine words by your false promises by my fine words and false promises yes didn t you tell me i was the prettiest girl in the whole saint germain des prés i tell you that now didn t you say that if i didn t love you you should die of love do you think i said that it s strange i don t remember it while on the contrary if i did love you you would marry me gervaise i didn t say that never you did say it monsieur never never never gervaise my father made me take an oath s to hamilcar what was that he made me swear to die a bachelor like himself oh cried gervaise summoning tears to the assistance of her a woman s marvellous power of weeping to order oh you re the rest promises cost nothing and when the poor girl is forget what they promised i will take my turn at swearing now that i will never be caught again and you will do well gervaise said the student when one thinks cried the grisette that there are laws for cut purses and none for the scoundrels who ruin poor girls but there are gervaise there are why of course didn t i tell you that they sent poor ascanio to for seducing colombe they did well too said gervaise to whom the loss of her honor presented itself so forcibly until she was fully convinced aubry was determined not to give her his name by way yes they did well and i wish you were in the him mon dieu that s all i ask cried the student and as i told you gervaise i rely upon you to put me there you rely upon me yes make sport of me ingrate i m not making sport of you gervaise i say that if you had to do what accuse me before the judge of what of having seduced you but you would never dare what s that i wouldn t dare cried gervaise in an injured tone t dare to tell the truth consider that you would have to make oath to it gervaise i ll do it you will make oath that i seduced you yes yes a hundred times yes then all goes well said the student joyfully i confess i an oath is a serious matter i ll take my oath to it this instant and send you to the châtelet good and you will find your ascanio there splendid and you will have all the time you need to do penance together it s all that i ask where is the lieutenant criminal at the palais de justice i will go there at once let us go together gervaise yes together in that way the punishment will follow at once take my arm gervaise come monsieur set off toward the palais de justice at the same gait at which accustomed to repair on sundays to the pré aux clercs or the they drew near the temple of themis as jacques aubry the edifice in question gervaise s pace slackened perceptibly they reached the foot of the staircase she had some difficulty and finally at the door of the lieutenant criminal her legs failed her altogether and the student felt her hanging upon his arm well gervaise said he is your courage giving out no said gervaise but a lieutenant criminal is an pardieu he s a man like other men true but one must tell him things very well tell them but i must swear then swear jacques said gervaise are you quite sure that you seduced me am i sure of it said jacques pardieu besides didn t you upon it yourself that i did yes that is true but strangely enough i don t seem to see in just the same light that i did a short time ago come come said jacques you are weakening already i knew jacques my dear cried gervaise take me back to the house gervaise gervaise said the student this isn t what you jacques i will never reproach you again or say a word about it you because you took my fancy that s all alas said the student this is what i feared but it s too late how too late you came here to accuse me and accuse me you must never jacques never you didn t seduce me jacques i was a flirt nonsense cried the student besides added gervaise lowering her eyes one can be seduced what do you mean the first time one loves hoity toity and you made me believe that you had never loved jacques take me back to the house oh indeed i won t said jacques exasperated by her refusal and reason she gave for it no no no he knocked at the magistrate s door what are you doing cried gervaise you see i am knocking come in cried a nasal voice i will not go in exclaimed gervaise doing her utmost to release from the student s i will not go in come in said the same voice a second time a little jacques i will shriek i will call for help said gervaise come in i say said the voice a third time nearer at hand and same moment the door opened well what do you want said a tall thin man dressed in black sight of whom made gervaise tremble from head to foot mademoiselle here said aubry has come to enter complaint against who has seduced her that he pushed gervaise into the black filthy closet which an anteroom to the lieutenant criminal s office the door her as if by a spring gave a feeble shriek half terror half surprise and sat down rather fell upon a stool which stood against the wall aubry meanwhile lest she should call him back or run hurried away through corridors known only to law students until he reached the courtyard of sainte chapelle thence pursued his way to pont saint michel which it was that gervaise must cross an hour later she appeared well said he running to meet her what happened alas said gervaise you made me tell a monstrous lie but i hope forgive me for it in view of my good intention i ll take it upon myself said aubry tell me what happened do you fancy that i know said gervaise i was so ashamed that remember what it was all about all i know is that the questioned me and that i answered his questions sometimes yes no but i am not sure that i answered as i should wretched girl cried aubry i believe it will turn out that herself of seducing me oh no i don t think i went as far as that at least they have my address haven t they so that they can yes murmured gervaise i gave it to them it s all right then said aubry and now let us hope that god will rest escorted gervaise to her abode and comforted her as best he the false testimony she had been compelled to give jacques home overflowing with faith in providence fact whether providence took a hand in it or chance did it all aubry received the next morning a summons to appear before criminal that same day summons fulfilled aubry s dearest hopes and yet a court of so redoubtable a place that he felt a shiver run through his veins read it but we hasten to say that the certainty of seeing and the longing to save the friend upon whom he had soon put an end to this demonstration of weakness on s part summons fixed the hour of noon and it was only nine o clock so upon gervaise whom he found no less agitated than on day well said she inquiringly well repeated jacques triumphantly exhibiting the paper covered which he held in his hand here it is for what hour noon that s all i was able to read then you don t know what you re accused of why of seducing you my little gervaise i presume you won t forget that you yourself insisted upon my doing it why no i am ready to give you a certificate that you utterly do it then you bear me no ill will for obeying you on the contrary i couldn t be more grateful to you whatever happens whatever happens if i did say all that it was because i was obliged to of course and if in my confusion i said more than i meant to say you me not only will i forgive you my dear my divine gervaise but i you now in advance ah said gervaise with a sigh ah bad boy with such words as turned my head which it is easy to see that gervaise had really been seduced a quarter before twelve jacques aubry remembered that his him appear at twelve he took leave of gervaise and as he had distance to go he ran all the way twelve o clock was striking knocked at the lieutenant criminal s door come in cried the same nasal voice was not called upon to repeat the invitation for jacques aubry smile on his lips his nose in the air and his cap over his ear stood in the tall black coated man s presence what is your name asked the tall man jacques aubry replied the student what are you law student what have you been doing seducing girls aha you re the man against whom a complaint was lodged by by gervaise perrette popinot very good sit down yonder and await your turn sat down as the man in black bade him do and waited or six persons of varying age sex and feature were waiting and as they had arrived before him their turns naturally his some of them went out alone they were the ones doubtless whom no sufficient evidence was adduced while others went by an exempt or by two of the provost s guards envied the fortune of these latter for they were being taken châtelet to which he was so anxious to be admitted last the name of jacques aubry student was called jacques rose and rushed into the magistrate s office as joyously as were on his way to the most agreeable of entertainments were two men in the lieutenant criminal s sanctum one taller and more forbidding than he in the antechamber which would have deemed impossible five minutes earlier this was the other was short fat coarse with a cheerful eye a and a jovial expression generally this was the magistrate s smile and his met and the student was quite ready to grasp so strongly conscious was he of the existence of a bond between them ha ha ha laughed the lieutenant criminal as he caught s eye faith that is true messire the student rejoined you seem a jolly dog said the magistrate come master knave take and sit you down aubry took a chair sat down threw one leg over the other it in high glee ah exclaimed the lieutenant rubbing his hands master clerk let over the complainant s deposition clerk rose and by virtue of his great height readied over to side of the table and selected the documents concerning from a pile of papers here it is he said who lodges the complaint inquired the magistrate gervaise perrette popinot said the clerk that s it said the student nodding his head violently that s a minor said the clerk nineteen years of age oho a minor exclaimed aubry so it appears from her declaration poor gervaise muttered aubry she was quite right when she said was so confused she didn t know what answers she made she to twenty two however nineteen it is and so said the lieutenant criminal and so my buck you with seducing a minor child ha ha ha ha ha ha echoed aubry joining in the judge s hilarity with aggravating circumstances continued the clerk mingling tones with the jovial voices of the magistrate and the student with aggravating circumstances repeated the former the devil exclaimed jacques i should like very much to know were as the complainant remained deaf to all the entreaties and wiles of for six months for six months jacques interposed pardon monsieur i think there mistake there for six months monsieur so it is written replied the man in black a tone which admitted no rejoinder so be it six months it is said jacques but in truth gervaise right when she said the said jacques aubry angered by her coldness threatened her oh oh exclaimed jacques oh oh echoed the judge but the clerk read on the said gervaise perrette popinot held stubbornly and courageously that the insolent fellow begged in view of his sincere repentance ah ah muttered aubry ah ah exclaimed the magistrate poor gervaise aubry continued speaking to himself with a shrug what was the matter with her head but continued the clerk his repentance was only feigned the complainant in her innocence and purity to be deceived by it and one evening when she was to accept refreshments of which the accused invited her the said jacques aubry mixed with her water with her water the student interrupted the complainant declared that she never drinks wine said the said jacques aubry mixed an intoxicating decoction with look you master clerk cried aubry what the deuce are you the complainant s deposition impossible is it so written inquired the magistrate it is written go on after all said aubry aside the more guilty i am the surer i of being sent to join ascanio at the châtelet it is go on master clerk you confess do you queried the judge i confess said the student ah gallows bird exclaimed the judge roaring with laughter his hands so that continued the clerk poor gervaise bereft of her reason by confessing to her seducer that she loved him aha said jacques lucky knave murmured the lieutenant criminal whose little why cried aubry why there isn t a word of truth in the whole you deny the charge absolutely write said the magistrate that the accused declares that he is of any of the charges brought against him wait a moment wait a moment cried the student who reflected that denied his guilt they would not send him to prison so you don t deny it altogether queried the judge i confess that there is some little truth not in the form but in oh as you have confessed to the decoction said the judge you well admit the results true said jacques as i ve confessed to the decoction i admit master clerk but upon my word he added in an undertone gervaise was quite right in saying but that s not all the clerk interrupted him what that s not all the crime of which the accused was guilty had terrible results gervaise discovered that she was about to become a mother ah that is too much cried jacques do you deny the paternity asked the judge not only do i deny the paternity but i deny the condition write said the judge that the accused denies the paternity denies the condition an inquiry will be ordered on that point one moment one moment cried aubry realizing that if gervaise of falsehood on a single point the whole structure would the ground did gervaise really say what the clerk has read she said it word for word replied the clerk then if she said it continued aubry if she said it why well queried the lieutenant criminal why it must be so write that the accused pleads guilty to all the charges clerk wrote as directed pardieu said the student to himself if ascanio deserves a week châtelet for simply paying court to colombe i who have drugged her and seduced her can count upon three months at the very least but faith i would like to be sure facts however i must congratulate gervaise peste she kept to and jeanne d arc was nowhere beside her so you confess to all the crimes you re accused of said the judge i do messire replied jacques unhesitatingly i do all of them too if you choose i am a great sinner monsieur le don t spare me impudent varlet muttered the magistrate in the tone in which of comedy speaks to his nephew impudent varlet out upon you that he let his great round head with his bloated purple face upon his breast and reflected magisterially whereas he began after meditating a few moments raising his head lifting the index finger of his right hand write whereas jacques aubry clerk of the basoche has pleaded the charge of seducing one gervaise perrette popinot by fine simulated affection we sentence said jacques aubry to pay a fine paris sous to support the child if it is a boy and to pay and the imprisonment cried aubry imprisonment what do you mean asked the judge why i mean the imprisonment for heaven s sake aren t you going me to prison no you re not going to order me committed to the châtelet as who s ascanio ascanio is a pupil of master benvenuto cellini what did he do he seduced a maid who was she mademoiselle colombe d estourville daughter of the provost of paris what then what then why i say that it s unjust when we both committed the to make a distinction in the punishment what you send him and fine me twenty paris sous in god s name is there no this world on the contrary rejoined the magistrate it is because there in this world and enlightened justice too that this is as how so there are honors and honors my young rascal the honor of a is valued at imprisonment the honor of a grisette is paris sous if you want to go to the châtelet you must try on a duchess and then the affair will take care of itself but this is frightful immoral outrageous cried the student my dear friend said the judge pay your fine and begone i won t pay my fine and i won t go then i shall call a couple of archers and commit you to prison do pay it that s all i ask judge summoned two guards take this scoundrel to the grands carmes the grands carmes cried jacques why not the châtelet pray because the châtelet is not a debtor s prison my friend because is a royal fortress and one must have committed some to be sent there the châtelet ah yes my little fellow you to the châtelet soon enough just wait one moment said aubry one moment what is it if i am not to be sent to the châtelet i will pay very well if you pay there s nothing more to be said you may go the young man will pay archers went out and jacques aubry took from his wallet twenty which he spread out in a line on the judge s desk see if that is right said the lieutenant criminal clerk rose and to execute the order bent his back like a how in the half circle described by his body which seemed the power of lengthening itself out indefinitely his table papers which lay upon it as he stood with his feet on the floor hands on the judge s desk he reminded one of a sombre hued rainbow it is right he said then off with you my young rascal said the magistrate and to others the court has no more time to waste on you go saw that he had nothing to gain by remaining there and despair which jacques aubry rises to well upon my word said the student to himself as he left the justice and mechanically crossed the pont aux moulins which out almost opposite the châtelet upon my word i am curious what gervaise will say when she learns that her honor is valued paris sous she will say that i have been indiscreet and i shouldn t have told and she ll tear my eyes out but what see yonder the student saw was a page belonging to the amiable nobleman he was accustomed to confide his secrets and whom he looked one of his dearest friends the boy was leaning up against of the bridge and amusing himself by performing sleight of with pebbles pardieu said the student this happens very fortunately my friend name i don t know and who seems to stand extremely well at court have influence enough to have me committed to prison his page to me to tell me where i can find him as i know name nor his address order to avail himself of what he considered a direct providence in his behalf jacques aubry advanced toward the who likewise recognized him and letting his three pebbles the same hand crossed his legs and awaited the student with look which is especially characteristic of the profession he had the honor to belong bon jour monsieur le page cried aubry from the most distant which he thought the boy could hear his voice bon jour seigneur student was the reply what are you doing quarter faith if i must tell you i was looking for something which i think found now that i see you i was seeking the address of friend the comte the baron the vicomte your master do you wish to see him asked the page instantly if possible in that case you will have your wish in a moment for he is calling provost at the châtelet yes he will come out directly he s very lucky to be admitted to the châtelet when he wishes but friend the vicomte the comte the baron vicomte on intimate terms with messire robert d estourville the vicomte de me continued aubry anxious to avail himself of the learn his friend s name at last the vicomte de the vicomte de mar ah cried the student interrupting the page in the middle of as he saw the man he sought appear at the door ah my there you are i was looking for you and waiting for you bon jour said marmagne evidently but little pleased at bon jour my dear fellow i would be glad to talk with you unfortunately i am very hurried so adieu one moment one moment cried jacques clinging to his friend s arm deuce take me you won t leave me like this in the first place i very great favor to ask of you you yes i and god s law you know bids friends to succor one another friends to be sure aren t you my friend what constitutes friendship now i am full of confidence in you i tell you all my and other people s too have you ever had occasion to repent of your confidence never so far as you are concerned at least but it s not so there is one man in paris that i am looking for and s help i shall meet him some day my dear fellow interrupted marmagne who had a shrewd suspicion man was i told you that i was much hurried but wait a moment pray when i tell you that you can do me a well speak quickly you stand well at court do you not my friends say so you have some influence then my enemies may discover it to their cost very good now my dear comte my dear baron my dear vicomte help me to get into the châtelet in what capacity as a prisoner as a prisoner that s a singular ambition on my word as you please but it s my ambition for what purpose do you wish to be committed to the châtelet who suspected that this strange desire on the part of indicated some new secret which it might be to his advantage to any other than you i wouldn t tell it my good friend or i have learned to my cost or rather to poor ascanio s i must learn to hold my tongue but with you it s a you know that i have no secrets from you in that case tell me quickly will you have me committed to the châtelet if i tell you instantly well my friend imagine that i was idiot enough to confide to yourself the fact that i had seen a lovely girl in the head of of mars what then the crack brained fools would you believe that they spread the that it came to the provost s ears and as the provost had lost some days before he suspected that it was she who had hiding place he notified d orbec and the duchesse d etampes to the hôtel de nesle to make a domiciliary visit while was at fontainebleau they carried off colombe and nonsense it s as i tell you my dear viscount and who managed it all a de marmagne but interposed the viscount not at all pleased to hear his name student s lips you don t tell me why you want to be committed châtelet you don t understand no they arrested ascanio yes and took him to the châtelet very good but what they don t know and what nobody knows save the etampes benvenuto and myself is that ascanio possesses a a certain secret which places the duchess in his power now understand yes i begin to see light but do you help me my dear friend you see viscount continued aubry assuming a more and air i want to be admitted to the châtelet get s cell take the letter or learn the secret leave the go to benvenuto and arrange with him some method s virtue and ascanio s love may triumph to the confusion of and d orbecs the provost the duchesse d etampes and clique that s a very ingenious plan said marmagne thanks for your confidence my dear student you shall have no regret it do you promise me your assistance to what end why to help me get committed to the châtelet as i asked you rely upon me immediately wait here for me where i am in this same spot and you i am going to get the order for your arrest ah my friend my dear baron my dear count but you must tell me and address in case i may need you useless i will return at once yes return as soon as possible and if you chance to meet marmagne on the road tell him what tell him that i have sworn an oath that he shall die by no hand adieu cried the viscount adieu and wait here for me au revoir said aubry i will expect you soon ah you are a a man one can trust and i would be glad to know adieu seigneur student said the page who had stood aloof conversation and was now about to follow his master adieu my pretty page said aubry but before you leave me do me what is it who is this gallant nobleman to whom you have the honor to belong he whom you ve been talking with for the last fifteen minutes the same and whom you call friend yes you don t know his name no why he is a very well known nobleman is he not to be sure and influential next to the king and the duchesse d etampes he s the man ah and his name you say is he is the vicomte de but he is turning back and calling me the vicomte de the vicomte de marmagne marmagne cried aubry vicomte de marmagne that young gentleman vicomte de marmagne himself marmagne the friend of the provost and d orbec and madame d etampes in person and the enemy of benvenuto cellini just so ah exclaimed aubry to whom the whole past was revealed as by a lightning ah i understand now o marmagne marmagne the student was unarmed with a movement as swift as thought the page s short sword by the hilt drew it from its sheath in pursuit of marmagne shouting halt his first shout marmagne decidedly ill at ease looked around and aubry rushing after him sword in hand suspected that he to stand his ground or fly was therefore the marmagne was not quite courageous enough to stand nor was he quite enough of a coward to fly he therefore intermediate course of darting into a house the door of which hoping to close the door behind him but unluckily for him it fast to the wall by a chain which he could not detach so who was some little distance behind him was in the before he had time to reach the staircase ah marmagne you damned viscount you infernal spy you filcher it s you is it at last i know you and have my hand on you guard villain on guard monsieur replied marmagne trying to assume a lordly bearing do that the vicomte de marmagne will honor the student by crossing swords with him if the vicomte de marmagne will not honor jacques aubry by with him jacques aubry will have the honor of passing his the vicomte de marmagne s body leave no doubt in the mind of him to whom this threat was addressed aubry placed the point of his sword against the viscount and let him feel the touch of the cold steel through murder cried marmagne help help oh shout as much as you choose retorted jacques you will have before any one comes and so the best thing you can do is to defend yourself on guard viscount on guard if you will have it so cried the viscount wait a bit and you as the reader will have discovered ere this was not but like all noblemen of that chivalrous epoch he had received education furthermore he was reputed to have some skill it is true that this reputation was said to result rather him to avoid unpleasant encounters which he might have had in bringing to a fortunate conclusion those which he did have none the less true that being closely pressed by jacques he sword and stood on guard in the most approved style of the art if marmagne s skill was recognized among the noblemen at court aubry s address was accepted as an incontestable fact among at the university and the clerks of the basoche the that the moment their swords crossed each of the combatants he had to do with no despicable opponent but marmagne had advantage the page s sword which aubry had taken was six than the viscount s this was no great disadvantage in but became a serious matter when he wished to assume furthermore marmagne was six inches taller than the student being armed with a sword as much longer he had simply to present at his face to keep him at a distance while jacques cut and feinted to no purpose marmagne without retreating a step out of reach simply by drawing his right leg back beside the left consequence was that despite aubry s agility the viscount s grazed his chest several times while he could succeed in more substantial than the air try as hard as he would realized that he was lost if he continued to play the same game in order to give his opponent no idea of the plan he proposed he continued to thrust and parry in the ordinary way imperceptibly inch by inch when he thought he was he allowed himself to be caught off guard as if marmagne seeing an opening made a lunge but aubry for him he parried the blow and taking advantage of of his opponent s sword two inches above his head it leaped upon him and thrust as he leaped so cleverly and that the page s short sword disappeared up to the hilt in s breast uttered one of those shrill cries which indicate a his hand fell to his side the blood left his cheeks and he to the ground that moment the patrol came running up attracted by marmagne the gestures of the page and the sight of the crowd in the door as aubry still held his bloody sword in his hand him undertook at first to make some resistance but as the leader patrol shouted disarm the villain and take him to the châtelet gave up his sword and followed the guards to the prison to which so anxious to gain admission marvelling at the merciful decrees which accorded him at the same time the two things he vengeance upon marmagne and access to ascanio time no objection was made to his reception within the walls of fortress but as it seemed that it was at the moment with guests there was a long discussion between the the warden of the prison as to where the new comer should at last the two worthies seemed to agree upon the point motioned to aubry to follow him led him down thirty two steps a door pushed him into a very dark dungeon and closed the him the difficulty which an honest man securing his release from student stood for an instant blinded by the abrupt transition to darkness where was he he had no idea was he near ascanio from him he knew not in the corridor through which he had passed had noticed but two other doors beside the one which was opened but his primary object was gained he was under the same roof friend as he could not spend the rest of his life in that one spot as he could see at the other end of the dungeon about fifteen a faint ray of light struggling in through an air hole put forth his leg with the instinctive purpose of walking spot but at the second step that he took the floor seemed give way under his feet he plunged down three or four stairs doubtless have gone head foremost against the wall had not come in contact with some object which tripped him up the that he escaped with nothing worse than a few bruises object which had unwittingly rendered him so important a service a hollow groan i beg your pardon said jacques rising and politely removing his cap it seems that i stepped upon some person or some thing a rudeness i should never have been guilty if i had been able to you stepped said a voice upon what was for sixty years a man soon to become a corpse for all eternity in that case said jacques my regret is all the greater for you at a moment when you were engaged doubtless as every should be at such a time in settling your accounts with god my accounts are all settled master student i have sinned like a man i have suffered like a martyr and i hope that god when weighing and my sorrows will find that the sum of the latter exceeds the former amen said aubry i hope so too with all my heart but if it will you too much my dear companion in adversity i say my because i presume you bear no malice on account of the which procured me the honor of your acquaintance a short if it will not fatigue you too much i say pray tell me how in ascertaining that i am a student i knew it by your costume and by the inkhorn hanging at your belt place where a gentleman carries his dagger you say you knew it by my costume by the inkhorn ah my you told me if i mistake not that you are at the point i hope that i have at last reached the end of my sufferings yes to fall asleep to day on earth to wake to morrow in heaven i in no wise dispute what you say replied jacques but i to remind you that your present situation is not one in which customary to joke who says that i am joking murmured the dying man with a deep sigh what you say that you recognized me by my costume by the inkhorn belt and i look as hard as i may cannot see my hands before possibly rejoined the prisoner but when you have been fifteen a dungeon as i have you will be able to see in the darkness as you could see formerly in broad daylight may the devil tear my eyes out rather than make them serve such cried the student fifteen years you have years in prison fifteen or sixteen years perhaps more perhaps less i long to count days or to measure time you must have committed some abominable crime cried the student been punished so pitilessly i am innocent replied the prisoner innocent cried jacques aghast ah my dear comrade i have you that this is no time for joking and i replied that i was not joking but still less is it a time for lying for a joke is simply of the mind which offends neither heaven nor earth is a deadly sin which compromises the soul s wellbeing i have never lied why you say that you are innocent and yet you have been fifteen prison fifteen years more or less i said ah cried jacques and i also am innocent may god protect you then rejoined the dying man why do you say that because a guilty man may hope for pardon an innocent man never what you say is very profound my friend but it s not consoling do you know i tell you the truth come said jacques come you have some little peccadillo or other yourself with haven t you between ourselves tell me that jacques who was really beginning to distinguish objects darkness took a stool carried it to the dying man s bedside and a spot where there was a recess in the wall placed the and made himself as comfortable as possible in his chair ah you say nothing my friend you have no confidence in me oh well can understand that fifteen years in prison may well have made my name is jacques aubry i am twenty two years old and as you have discovered according to what you say at least certain reasons which concern myself alone for getting to the châtelet i have been here ten minutes i have had of making your acquaintance there s my whole life in a word know me now as well as i know myself now my dear companion i to you i am etienne raymond said the prisoner etienne raymond the student repeated i don t know that name in the first place said the prisoner you were a child when god to have me disappear from the world in the next place of little consequence in the world so that no one noticed but what did you do who were you i was the connétable de bourbon s confidential servant oho and you had a share with him in betraying the state in that am no longer surprised no i refused to betray my master that was all tell me about it how did it happen i was at the constable s hôtel in paris while he was living at of bourbon l archambault one day the captain of his with a letter from monseigneur the letter bade me to the messenger a small sealed package which i would find in s bedroom in a small closet near the head of his bed i went captain to the bedroom opened the closet found the package in described and handed it to the messenger who immediately leave an hour later an officer with a squad of soldiers came louvre and bade me throw open the duke s bedroom and show them closet near the head of the bed i obeyed they opened the closet failed to find what they sought which was nothing less than the duke s messenger had carried away the devil the devil muttered aubry beginning to take a in the situation of his companion in misfortune the officer made some terrible threats to which i made no other that i knew nothing about what he asked me for if i had said had just handed the package to the duke s messenger they could him and taken it from him peste aubry interrupted that was clever of you and you acted faithful and trusty retainer thereupon the officer gave me in charge to two guards and returned louvre with the others in half an hour he returned with orders me to the château of pierre encise at lyons they put irons on bound my hands and tossed me into a carriage with a soldier side five days later i was confined in a prison which i say was far from being as dark and severe as this but what matter muttered the dying man a prison s a prison and i by becoming accustomed to this as to all the others hum said jacques aubry that proves you to be a philosopher three days and three nights passed continued etienne raymond during the fourth night i was awakened by a slight noise my eyes my door turned upon its hinges a woman closely with the jailer the jailer placed a lamp upon the table and a sign from my nocturnal visitor left the cell thereupon she my bed and raised her veil i cried aloud hein who was it pray aubry asked edging closer to the narrator it was louise of savoy herself the duchesse d angoulême in person the regent of france the king s mother oho said aubry and what was she doing with a poor devil like you she was in quest of the same sealed package which i had delivered duke s messenger and which contained love letters written by princess to the man she was now persecuting well upon my word muttered jacques between his teeth here s most devilishly like the story of the duchesse d etampes alas the stories of all frivolous love sick princesses resemble replied the prisoner whose ears seemed to be as quick as were piercing but woe to the poor devils who happen to in them stay a moment stay a moment prophet of evil cried aubry what s that you re saying i too am involved in the story of love sick princess very well if that is so say farewell to the light of day to life go to the devil with your predictions of the other world what s to me i m not the one she loves but ascanio was it i that the regent loved retorted the prisoner was it i very existence they had never heard of no but i was a barren love and a fruitful vengeance and when they i was the one to be crushed by mahomet s belly you are not very encouraging my good man but let us return to the princess for your narrative beyond measure just because it makes me tremble the packet contained letters which she wanted as i have told you for them she promised me honors dignities titles to letters again she would have extorted four hundred thousand from another semblançay though he should pay for his the scaffold i replied that i hadn t the letters that i knew nothing about them i had no idea what she meant thereupon her munificent offers were succeeded by threats but it no easier to intimidate than to bribe me for i had told i had delivered the letters to my noble master s messenger she left my cell in a furious rage and for a year i heard at the end of a year she returned and the same scene at that time i begged i implored her to let me go free i adjured the name of my wife and children but to no purpose i must give letters or die in prison one day i found a file in my bread my noble master had remembered me absent exiled a fugitive as of course he could not set me free by entreaty or by force he of his servants to france who induced the jailer to hand me telling me whence it came i filed through one of the bars at my window i made myself a rope sheets i descended by the rope but when i came to the end of it in vain for the ground with my feet i dropped with god s my lips and broke my leg in the fall a night patrol found i was thereupon transferred to the château of chalons sur saône there about two years at the end of which time my her appearance again it was still the letters that brought this time she was accompanied by the torturer and i was put question this was useless barbarity as she obtained indeed she could obtain none i knew nothing save that delivered the letters to the duke s messenger one day at the bottom of my jug of water i found a bag filled once more my noble master bethought himself of his poor servant i bribed a turnkey or rather the miserable creature pretended to at midnight he opened the door of my cell and i went out him through several corridors i could already feel the living men breathe and thought that i was free when guards upon us and bound us both my guide had pretended to yield to in order to get possession of the gold he had seen in and then betrayed me to earn the reward offered to informers they brought me to the châtelet to this cell here for the last time louise of savoy appeared she was the executioner the prospect of death could have no other effect than the promises and torture my hands were bound a rope was passed through and placed around my neck i made the same reply as always to adding that she would fulfil my dearest wish by putting me for i was driven to despair by my life of captivity it was that feeling doubtless which made her hold her hand she and the executioner followed her since then i have never seen her what has become of my noble master has become of the cruel duchess i have no idea for since some fifteen years perhaps i have not exchanged a single a single living being they are both dead said aubry both dead the noble hearted duke is dead why he would still be man not more than fifty two how did he die he was killed at the siege of rome and probably jacques was add by one of my friends but he refrained thinking cause a coolness between the old man and himself jacques as was becoming very discreet probably the prisoner repeated by a goldsmith named benvenuto cellini twenty years ago i would have cursed the murderer to day i say bottom of my heart may his murderer be blessed did they give lord a burial worthy of the man i think so they built a tomb for him in the cathedral of gaeta the tomb is an epitaph wherein it is said that beside him there alexander the great was a sorry knave and cæsar an and the other what other the woman who persecuted me dead also dead nine years since just so one night here in my cell i saw a phantom kneeling i cried out and it disappeared it was she asking do you think then that when death came upon her she relented i trust so for her soul s sake but in that case they should have set you free she may have requested it but i am of so little importance that i forgotten in the excitement of that great catastrophe and so you would likewise forgive her as you are about to die lift me up young man that i may pray for both of them and the resting in jacques aubry s arms coupled the names of his persecutress in the same prayer the man who had remembered him affection and the woman who had never forgotten him in the constable and the regent prisoner was right jacques aubry s eyes began to become the darkness and he could make out the dying man s features he handsome old man much emaciated by suffering with a white beard bald head such a head as domenichino dreamed of when painting of saint jerome his prayer was finished he heaved a deep sigh and fell back bed he had swooned thought that he was dead he ran to the water jug however some water in the hollow of his hand and shook it over his face dying man returned to life once more you did well to revive me young man said he and here is what is that a dagger a dagger how did it come into your hands wait one moment one day when the turnkey brought my bread and water put the lamp upon the stool which happened to be standing near in the wall at that point was a protruding stone and i saw cut with a knife upon it i hadn t time to read them but i some earth with my hands moistened it so as to make a sort of paste took an impression of the letters which formed the word ultor what was the significance of that word which means avenger i the stone i tried to shake it it moved like a tooth in its socket dint of patience and persistent efforts i succeeded in removing the wall i immediately plunged my hand into the hole and dagger thereupon the longing for liberty which i had almost lost returned in full force i resolved to dig a passage way from this to near at hand with the dagger and there concoct some plan with its occupant besides even if it all ended in failure and cutting was something to occupy my time and when you twenty years in a dungeon as i have young man you will a formidable enemy time is shuddered from head to foot did you ever put your plan he inquired yes and more easily than i anticipated after the twelve or that i have been here they have doubtless ceased to think of as a possibility indeed it s very likely that they no who i am they keep me as they keep the chain hanging from the constable and the regent are dead and they alone who would now recognize the name of etienne raymond even in if i should pronounce it no one felt the perspiration starting from every pore as he thought oblivion into which this lost existence had fallen well he exclaimed questioningly well for more than a year said the old man i dug and dug and in making a hole under the wall large enough for a man to but what did you do with the dirt you took from the hole i strewed it over the floor of my cell and trod it in by upon it where is the hole under my bed for fifteen years no one has ever thought of moving it jailer came down into my cell only once a day when he had gone doors were closed and the sound of his footsteps had died away draw out my bed and set to work when the time for his visit i would move the bed back to its place and lie down upon it day before yesterday i lay down upon it never to rise again i was end of my strength to day i am at the end of my life you are young man you shall assist me to die and i will make you your heir said aubry in amazement to be sure i will leave you this dagger you smile what more could a prisoner leave you this dagger is freedom perhaps you are right said aubry and i thank you whither does this you have dug lead i had not reached the other end but i was very near it day i heard voices in the cell beside this the devil said aubry and you think i think that you will have finished my work in a very few hours thanks said aubry thanks and now a priest i would much like to see a priest said wait father wait said aubry it is impossible that they such a request from a dying man ran to the door this time without stumbling his eyes being to the darkness and knocked with feet and hands both turnkey came down what s the matter that you make such an uproar he demanded what want the old man here with me is dying said aubry and asks for a priest you refuse hum grumbled the jailer i don t know why these fellows must priests it s all right we ll send him one minutes later the priest appeared carrying the viaticum by two sacristans one with the crucifix the other with solemn and impressive spectacle was the confession of this martyr naught to disclose but the crimes of others and who prayed for instead of asking pardon for himself as was jacques aubry he fell upon his knees the prayers of his childhood which he thought he the prisoner had finished his confession the priest bowed and asked his blessing old man s face lighted up with a smile as radiant as the smile s elect he extended one hand over the priest s head and the aubry drew a deep breath and fell back upon his pillow was his last priest went out as he had come attended by his subordinates dungeon lighted for a moment by the flickering flame of became dark once more aubry was alone with the dead it was a very especially in the light of the reflections to which it the man who lay lifeless before him had been consigned to innocent man had remained there twenty years and went out at because death the great liberator came in search of him light hearted student could not recognize himself for the he found himself confronted by stern reality for the first time in the face the bewildering vicissitudes of life and the of death a selfish thought began to take shape in his heart he thought innocent like the dead man and like him involved in of one of those royal passions which crush and consume a life ascanio and he might disappear as etienne raymond who would think of them perhaps benvenuto cellini certainly the former could do nothing but weep and the other confessed powerlessness when he cried so loudly for the letter in ascanio only chance of safety his only hope lay in the heritage of man an old dagger which had already disappointed the its two former owners aubry had hidden the dagger in his breast and he nervously hand upon the hilt to make sure that it was still there that moment the door opened and men came in to remove the body when shall you bring me my dinner jacques asked i am hungry in two hours the jailer replied that the student was left alone in the cell honest passed the two hours sitting upon his stool without once moving mind was so active that it kept his body at rest the appointed hour the turnkey came down renewed the water the bread this was what in châtelet parlance was called student remembered what the dying man told him that the door of would be opened but once in the twenty four hours however he for a long while in the same place absolutely motionless lest the event that had just occurred should cause some the routine of the prison soon observed through his air hole that it was beginning to the day just passed had been a well filled day for him in the examination by the magistrate at noon the duel at one o clock lodged in prison at three the prisoner and now his first attempts at securing his freedom man does not pass many such days in his life aubry rose at last and walked to the door to listen then in order that the dirt and the wall might leave upon his doublet he removed that portion of his costume bed away from the corner and found the opening of which had spoken crawled like a snake into the narrow gallery which was some deep and which after making a dip under the partition wall on the other side soon as he plunged his dagger into the earth he knew by the he would very soon accomplish his purpose which was to open into some place or other what that place would be only could have told kept actively at work making as little noise as possible from time he went out of the excavation as a miner does in order the loose earth about the floor of his cell otherwise it have blocked up the gallery then he would crawl back to work once more aubrey was working ascanio was thinking sadly of colombe too as we have said had been taken to the châtelet he too cast into a dungeon but it may have been by chance it may at the duchess s suggestion his quarters were a little less bare a little more habitable than the student s what did ascanio care for a little more or a little less comfort dungeon was a dungeon all the same his captivity a separation not colombe who was more to him than light or liberty or life colombe with him in his dungeon the dungeon would become an bliss a palace of enchantment poor child had been so happy during the days immediately arrest thinking of his beloved by day and sitting by her side he had never thought that his happiness might some day come to and if sometimes in the midst of his felicity the iron hand had clutched his heart he had like one threatened by danger unknown source promptly put aside all uneasiness concerning that he might lose none of his present bliss now he was in prison alone far from colombe who was like himself perhaps a prisoner in some convent whence escape in no other way than by going to the chapel where whom they sought to force upon her awaited her redoubtable passions were standing guard at their cell doors of madame d etampes at ascanio s the ambition of comte d orbec s soon as he was alone in his dungeon therefore ascanio became and down hearted his was one of those clinging natures which support of some robust organization he was one of those slender flowers which bend before the first breath of the tempest up again only in the vivifying rays of the sun benvenuto been in his place his first thought would have been the doors sound the walls and stamp upon the floor to see or the other would not afford his quick and combative mind means of escape but ascanio sat down upon his bed let fall upon his breast and whispered colombe s name it to him that one could escape by any possible means from behind three iron doors and surrounded by walls six feet thick dungeon was as we have said a little less bare and a little than that assigned to jacques it contained a bed a table chairs and an old rush mat furthermore a lamp was burning upon projection doubtless arranged for that purpose beyond was a cell set apart for privileged prisoners was also a great difference in the matter of food instead of and water which was brought to the student once a day two daily repasts a privilege somewhat neutralized by necessity of seeing the jailer twice in the twenty these repasts it should be said to the credit of administration of the châtelet were not thought but little of such paltry details his was one of feminine organizations which seem to exist on perfume and dew awaking from his reverie he ate a hit of bread drank a of wine and continued to think of colombe and of of colombe as of her to whom all his love was given of of him in whom lay all his hope up to that moment ascanio had never been concerned with any cares or details of existence benvenuto lived for both and content to breathe to dream of some lovely work of art and to he was like the fruit which grows upon a sturdy tree and its life from the tree even now perilous as was his situation if he could have cellini at the moment of his arrest or at the moment of and benvenuto had said to him with a warm grasp of have no fear ascanio for i am watching over you and colombe in the master was so great that relying upon that he would have waited without anxiety for the prison doors to open sure that thrown open they would be in spite of bars he had not seen benvenuto and benvenuto did not know that pupil the son of his stefana was a prisoner it would a whole day to carry the intelligence to him at fontainebleau that it had occurred to any one to do it another day to paris and in two days the enemies of the lovers might gain a upon their defender it was that ascanio passed the rest of the day and the whole of following his arrest without sleep sometimes pacing back in his cell sometimes sitting down and occasionally upon the bed which was provided with white sheets a of favor which proved that ascanio had been particularly the attention of the authorities during that day and night and morning nothing worthy of note occurred unless it was visit of the jailer to bring his food two o clock in the afternoon as nearly as the prisoner by his reckoning of the time he thought that he heard voices hand it was a dull indistinct murmur but evidently caused by organs of human beings ascanio listened and walked toward whence the sound seemed to come it was at one of the corners cell he silently put his ear to the wall and to the ground that the voices apparently came from beneath the floor was evident that he had neighbors who were separated from him only thin partition or an equally thin floor after some two hours ceased and all was still once more night the noise began again but this time it was of a it was not that which would be made by two persons but consisted of dull hurried blows as of some one it came from the same place did not cease for a second to come nearer and nearer as ascanio was in his own thoughts this noise seemed to of some attention none the less so he sat with his eyes the spot whence it came he judged that it must be near midnight did not once think of sleeping notwithstanding that he had not so many hours noise continued as it was long past the usual hour for work it some prisoner seeking to escape ascanio smiled sadly at that the poor devil who would think for a moment mayhap was at liberty would find that he had simply changed his cell last the noise approached so near that ascanio ran and seized and returned with it to the corner almost at the same moment rose up in that spot and as it fell away disclosed a human head uttered an exclamation of wonder followed by a cry of joy a no less delighted cry made answer the head belonged to an instant thanks to the assistance rendered by ascanio to visitor who made his appearance in such the two friends were in one another s arms will readily be conceived the first questions and answers incoherent but at last after exchanging a few they succeeded in restoring some semblance of order thoughts and in casting some light upon recent events ascanio sure had almost nothing to say and everything to learn aubry told him the whole story how he had returned to de nesle simultaneously with benvenuto how they had at the same moment of the arrest of ascanio and the abduction how benvenuto had rushed off to his studio like a madman to the casting to the casting and he aubry to of what had taken place at the hôtel de nesle since the student could tell him nothing to the general narrative of the iliad succeeded the of ulysses aubry described to ascanio his disappointment failure to get committed to prison his visit to gervaise and of him to the lieutenant criminal his which had no other result than the paltry fine of sous a result most insulting to the honor of gervaise his encounter with marmagne just as he was beginning to procuring his own incarceration from that point he that had happened to him up to the moment when utterly dark as to what cell he was about to enter he had thrust his the last crust of earth and discerned by the light of his friend ascanio the friends once more embraced with great heartiness now said jacques aubry listen to me ascanio for there is no lose but first of all said ascanio tell me of colombe where colombe i can t tell you with madame d etampes i think with madame d etampes cried ascanio her rival so what they say of the duchess s love for you is true is it blushed and stammered some unintelligible words oh you needn t blush for that cried aubry deuce take me and a duchess who s the king s mistress at that i should any such luck but let us come back to business yes said ascanio let us come back to colombe bah i m not talking about colombe i m talking about a letter what letter a letter the duchesse d etampes wrote you who told you that i have a letter from the duchesse d etampes in benvenuto cellini why did he tell you that because he must have that letter because it is absolutely he should have it because i agreed to take it to him because have done was done to get possession of that letter but for what purpose does benvenuto want the letter ah faith i ve no idea and it doesn t concern me he said to me have that letter i said to him very good i will get it i have had myself put in prison in order to get it so give it me i agree to deliver it to benvenuto well what s the matter last question was induced by the cloud which spread over ascanio the matter is my poor aubry said he that your trouble is how so cried aubry haven t you the letter still it is here said ascanio placing his hand upon the pocket of ah that s well give it to me and i will take it to benvenuto that letter will never leave me jacques why so because i don t know what use benvenuto proposes to make of it he means to use it to save you and to crush the duchesse d etampes it may be aubry i will not ruin a woman but this woman seeks to ruin you this woman detests you no i she adores you and you would have me in return for that feeling why it s exactly the same as if she hated you since you don t besides it s she who has done all this what she who has done it why yes it was she who caused your arrest and carried off colombe who told you that no one but who else could it have been why the provost or d orbec or marmagne to whom you admit that the whole story ascanio ascanio cried jacques in despair you are i prefer to destroy myself rather than do a dastardly deed aubry but this is no dastardly deed for benvenuto is the one who do it listen to me aubry said ascanio and don t be angry at what i say benvenuto stood in your place and should say to me it was etampes your enemy who caused your arrest who carried off colombe now has her in her power and intends to force her to do what not wish to do i cannot save colombe unless i have i would make him swear that he would not show it to the king then i would give it to him but benvenuto is not here and i am that it is the duchess who is persecuting me this letter be safe in your hands aubry forgive me but you yourself you are an arrant chatterbox i promise you ascanio that the day i have just passed has aged me you may lose the letter or with the best intentions i know make use of it aubry so the letter will remain where it is but my dear fellow cried jacques remember that benvenuto that nothing but this letter can save you benvenuto will save me without that aubry benvenuto has the king that he will grant him whatever favor he asks on the day that is safely cast when you thought that benvenuto was going he shouted to the casting he was beginning to rescue me but suppose the casting should be unsuccessful said aubry there s no danger rejoined ascanio with a smile but that sometimes happens to the most skilful founders in france so told the most skilful founders in france are mere schoolboys compared but how much time is required for the casting three days and how much more before the statue can be put before the king three days more six or seven days in all and suppose madame d etampes forces marry d orbec within six days madame d etampes has no power over colombe colombe will resist very true but the provost has power over colombe as his daughter françois i has power over colombe as his subject suppose and the king both order her to marry him became frightfully pale suppose that when benvenuto demands your liberty colombe is wife of another what will you do with your liberty then passed one hand across his brow to wipe away the cold the student s words caused to start thereon while with the he felt in his pocket for the precious letter but just as certain that he was on the point of yielding he shook his head to banish all irresolution no he said no no no one save benvenuto let us talk of words he uttered in a tone which indicated that for the moment it was useless to insist in that case said aubry apparently forming a momentous resolution in that case my friend if we are to talk on other subjects we may do it to morrow morning or later in the day for i am afraid remain here for some time for my own part i confess that i am by my tribulations of the day and my labor to night and shall sorry for a little rest do you remain here and i will go back to cell when you want to see me again do you call me meanwhile this mat over the hole i have made so that our not be cut off good night the night brings counsel they say hope that i shall find you more reasonable to morrow morning that and refusing to listen to the observations of ascanio to detain him jacques aubry plunged head first into his gallery crawled back to his cell ascanio meanwhile following up his friend had given him dragged the mat into the corner of as soon as the student s legs had disappeared the means between the two cells thereupon disappeared altogether then tossed his doublet upon one of the two chairs which with and the lamp constituted the furnishings of his apartment himself out upon the bed and overdone with fatigue as soon fell asleep his bodily weariness carrying the day over torture instead of following ascanio s example although he was quite in need of sleep as he sat down upon his stool and began deeply which as the reader knows was so entirely contrary his habits that it was evident that he was meditating some student s immobility lasted about fifteen minutes after which slowly and with the step of a man whose irresolution is at an good and all walked to the hole and crawled into it again time with so much caution and so noiselessly that when he other end and raised the mat he was overjoyed to perceive that had not aroused his friend was all that the student wished with even greater caution than theretofore exhibited he crept stealthily forth from gallery and approached with bated breath the chair on s doublet lay with one eye fixed upon the sleeping youth ears on the alert for the slightest sound he took from the precious letter so eagerly coveted by cellini and placed in a note from gervaise which he folded in exactly the same the duchess s letter sure that ascanio would believe so long as not open it that lovely anne d heilly s missive was still in silently as ever he stole back to the mat raised it crawled hole once more and disappeared like the phantoms who sink doors at the opera was high time for he was no sooner back in his cell than he s door grinding on its hinges and his friend s voice crying tone of one suddenly aroused from sleep who s there i responded a soft voice do not be afraid for it is a friend who was but half dressed rose at the sound of the voice seemed to recognize and saw by the light of his lamp a veiled by the door she slowly approached him and raised her veil not mistaken it was madame d etampes it is proved that a grisette s letter it is burned makes as much ashes as a duchess was upon anne d heilly s mobile features an expression of with compassion which deceived ascanio completely him even before she had opened her mouth in the she was entirely innocent of any share in the catastrophe of and colombe were victims you here ascanio she said in a melodious voice you to whom have given a palace to live in i find in a prison ah madame cried the youth it is true is it not that you of the persecution to which we are subjected did you suspect me for an instant ascanio said the duchess in you have every reason to hate me and i can only bewail in ill fortune in being so little known to him i know so well no madame no said ascanio i was told that you were it all but i refused to believe it t was well done of you ascanio you do not love me but with at least is not synonymous with injustice you were right not only am i not responsible for it but i knew about it it was the provost messire d estourville he whole story i know not how told it all to the king and him the order to arrest you and recover colombe and colombe is with her father demanded ascanio eagerly no colombe is with me with you madame cried the young man why with you she is very lovely ascanio murmured the duchess and i why you prefer her to all the women in the world even most loving of them all offers you the richest of duchies i love colombe madame said ascanio and you know that love a treasure sent from heaven is to be preferred to all yes ascanio yes you love her above everything for a moment i your passion for her was only a passing fancy i was mistaken yes realize now she added with a sigh that to keep you apart would be to run counter to god s will ah madame cried ascanio clasping his hands god has placed in the power to bring us together be noble and generous to the end and make two children happy who will love you and bless you lives yes said the duchess i am vanquished ascanio yes i am ready and defend you but alas it may be too late even now too late what do you mean cried ascanio it may be ascanio it may be that at this moment i am lost myself lost madame how so in god s name for having loved you for having loved me you lost because of me yes imprudent creature that i am lost because of you lost because to you how so i do not understand you madame you do not understand that the provost armed with an order from has directed a general search to be made at the hôtel de nesle do not understand that this search the principal purpose of to find proofs of your affair with colombe will be most out in your bedroom what then demanded ascanio impatiently why continued the duchess if they find that letter which in of frenzy i wrote to you if it is recognized as mine if it before the king whom i was then deceiving and whom i was betray for you do you not understand that my power is at an end moment do you not understand that i can then do nothing either or for colombe do you not understand in short that i am lost oh cried ascanio have no fear madame there is no danger of that letter is here it has never left me duchess breathed freely once more and the expression of her from anxiety to joy it has never left you ascanio she repeated it has never left you what sentiment pray tell me do i owe the fact that has never left you to prudence madame murmured ascanio prudence mon dieu mon dieu i am wrong once more and yet i be convinced ere this prudence ah well she added seeming a powerful effort to restrain her feelings in that case as naught but your prudence to thank ascanio do you think it to keep it upon your person when they may come to your cell moment and search you by force do you think it prudent i say a letter which if it is found will put the only person who you and colombe in a position where it will be impossible for help you madame said ascanio in his melodious voice and with that tinge which all pure hearts feel when they are forced to doubt not if the purpose to save colombe and myself exists at the your heart as it does upon your lips i know not whether the see that letter again and nothing more is the motive of your me i know not whether as soon as you have it in your possession may not lay aside this rôle of protectress which you and become our enemy once more but this i do know madame the letter is yours that it belongs to you and that the claim it i cease to have the right to keep it from you rose went straight to the chair upon which his doublet lay hand in the pocket and took out a letter the envelope of which recognized at a glance here madame he said is the paper you are so anxious to possess which can be of no use to me while it may injure you seriously it tear it up destroy it i have done my duty you may do choose ah yours is indeed a noble heart ascanio cried the duchess obedience to one of those generous impulses which are sometimes the most corrupt hearts some one comes madame take care cried ascanio true said the duchess the sound of approaching footsteps she hastily thrust the paper flame of the lamp which consumed it in an instant the duchess let it drop until the flame had almost scorched her fingers letter three fourths consumed drifted slowly downward when the floor it was entirely reduced to ashes but the duchess content until she had placed her foot upon them that moment the provost appeared in the doorway i was told that you were here madame he said looking uneasily duchess to ascanio and i hastened to descend and place myself service is there aught in which i or they who are under can be of any use to you no messire she replied unable to conceal the feeling of intense overflowed from her heart upon her face no but i am none obliged to you for your readiness and your good will i came question this young man whom you arrested and to ascertain if he as guilty as he was said to be and what is your conclusion queried the provost in a tone to could not refrain from imparting a slight tinge of irony that ascanio is less guilty than i thought i beg you therefore to show him every consideration in your power the poor in wretched quarters could you not give him a better room we will look to it to morrow madame for you know that your wishes to me have you any other commands and do you wish to examination no messire was the reply i know all that i wished to know that the duchess left the dungeon darting at ascanio a of mingled gratitude and passion provost followed her and the door closed behind them pardieu muttered jacques aubry who had not lost a word of between the duchess and ascanio pardieu it was time had been marmagne s first thought on recovering consciousness to to the duchess that he had received a wound which might well be mortal and that before he breathed his last he desired to her a secret of the deepest moment upon receipt of that message hastened to his side marmagne then informed her that he attacked and wounded by a certain student named jacques aubry endeavoring to gain admission to the châtelet in order to of ascanio and carry to cellini a letter that was in ascanio duchess needed to hear no more and bitterly cursing the had led her once more to overstep the limits of her she hurried to the châtelet although it was two o clock morning demanded to be shown to ascanio s cell and there scene we have described which had ended in accordance with so far as she knew although ascanio was not altogether deceived jacques aubry said it was high time only half of his task was accomplished and the most difficult to do he had the letter which had come so near being but in order that it should have its full effect it must be s hands not in jacques aubry s jacques aubry was a prisoner very much a prisoner and he from his predecessor that it was no easy matter to get out châtelet once one was safely lodged therein he was therefore say in much the same plight as the rooster who found the pearl perplexed as to the use to be made of his treasure attempt to escape by resorting to violence would be utterly vain with his dagger kill the keeper who brought his food and take and his clothes but not only was that extreme method repugnant student s kindly disposition it did not afford sufficiently of success there were ten chances to one that he would searched relieved of his precious letter and thrust his cell attempt to escape by cunning was even less hopeful the dungeon or ten feet underground there were huge iron bars across hole through which the one faint ray of light filtered into it would take months to loosen one of those bars and suppose them to be removed where would the fugitive then find himself courtyard with insurmountable walls where he would inevitably the next morning was his only remaining resource but as a consequence of pronounced by the lieutenant criminal whereby gervaise twenty paris sous for the loss of her honor the prisoner fortune was reduced to ten paris sous a sum utterly inadequate the lowest jailer of the vilest prison and which could be offered to the turnkey of a royal fortress aubry was therefore we are forced to confess in the time to time it seemed as if a hopeful idea passed through but it was evident that it was likely to entail for each time that it returned with the of hopeful ideas aubry s face grew perceptibly darker he heaved deep sighs which proved that the poor fellow an internal conflict of the most violent description conflict was so violent and so prolonged that aubry did not of sleep the whole night long he passed the time in striding fro in sitting down and standing up it was the first time that ever kept vigil all night for purposes of reflection his in that line had been on convivial occasions only daybreak the struggle seemed to have ended in the complete triumph of the opposing forces for jacques heaved a more heart than any he had yet achieved and threw himself upon his bed man completely crushed head had hardly touched the pillow when he heard steps on the key grated in the lock the door turned upon its hinges two officers of the law appeared in the doorway they were criminal and his clerk annoyance of the visit was tempered by the student s recognizing two old acquaintances aha my fine fellow said the magistrate recognizing aubry so it is it and you succeeded after all in getting into the châtelet tudieu what a rake you are you seduce young women and run through the body but beware a nobleman s life is than a grisette s honor and you ll not be quit of this twenty paris sous as the worthy magistrate s words undoubtedly were the tone he uttered them reassured the prisoner to some extent faced individual into whose hands he had had the good luck was such a good fellow to all appearance that it was impossible of him in connection with anything deadly to be sure it was same with his clerk who nodded his head approvingly at each fell from his principal s lips it was the second time that had seen the two men side by side and deeply engrossed as he his own precarious situation he could not forbear some upon the whimsical chance which had coupled together so utterly opposed to each other in character and feature examination began jacques aubry made no attempt at concealment that having recognized the vicomte de marmagne as a man on several occasions betrayed his confidence he seized his page and challenged him that marmagne had accepted the challenge after exchanging a few thrusts the viscount fell more than that not know you know no more than that you know no more than that muttered faith i should say that was quite enough and s as clear as day especially as the vicomte de marmagne is madame d etampes s great favorites so it seems that she of you to the higher powers my boy the devil exclaimed the scholar beginning to feel decidedly ill tell me monsieur le juge is the affair so bad as you say worse my dear friend worse i am not in the habit of who come before me but i give you warning of this so that if any arrangements to make arrangements to make cried the student tell me monsieur criminel for god s sake do you think my life s in danger certainly it is certainly what you attack a nobleman in the street force him to fight you run a sword through him and then you ask life s in danger yes my dear friend yes in very great danger but such affairs happen every day and i don t see that the guilty prosecuted true among gentlemen my young friend oh when it pleases to cut each other s throats it s a privilege of their rank the king has nothing to say but if the common people take it head some fine day to fight with gentlemen as they are as numerous there would soon be no more gentlemen which would great pity how many days do you think my trial will last five or six in all likelihood what cried the student five or six days no more than that why should it the facts are clear enough a man dies you confess killed him and justice is satisfied however added the judge a still more benevolent expression if two or three days be agreeable to you very agreeable oh well we will spin out the report and gain time in that way a good fellow at heart and i shall be delighted to do something thanks said the student and now said the judge rising have you any further request i would like to see a priest is it impossible no it is your right in that case monsieur le juge ask them to send one to me i will do your errand no ill will my young friend good lack on the contrary i am deeply grateful master student said the clerk in an undertone stepping to aubrey would you be willing to do me a favor gladly said aubrey what might it be it may be that you have friends or relatives to whom you intend all your possessions friends i have but one and he s a prisoner like myself relatives only cousins and very distant cousins at that so say on say on monsieur i am a poor man father of a family with five children what then i have never had any opportunities in my position which i fill as testify with scrupulous probity all my confrères are my head why is that why ah why i will tell you do so because they are lucky aha and why are they lucky that s what i would ask you master clerk and that s what i am about to tell you master student i shall be very glad to know they are lucky here the clerk lowered his voice a half they are lucky because they have the rope a man was hanged their pocket do you understand no you re rather dull you will make a will eh a will why should i dame so that there may be no contest among your heirs very good in your will that you authorize marc boniface grimoineau monsieur le lieutenant criminel to claim from the executioner a the rope you are hanged by ah said aubry in a choking voice yes now i understand and you will grant my request to be sure young man remember what you have promised me many have made the but some have died intestate others have written my name boniface grimoineau so badly that there was a chance for cavilling others still who were guilty monsieur on my word of honor have been acquitted and gone off elsewhere to be hanged i was really in despair when you fell in my way very well master cleric very well if i am hanged you shall you want never fear oh you will be monsieur you will he don t you doubt it well grimoineau said the judge here i am monsieur here i am so it s a bargain master student it s a bargain on your word of honor on my word i think that i shall get it at last muttered the clerk as i will go home and tell my wife and children the good news left the cell on the heels of the lieutenant criminal who good humoredly at having to wait so long it is proved that true friendship of carrying devotion to the marrying once more alone was soon more deeply absorbed in thought and the reader will agree that there was ample food for his conversation with the lieutenant criminal we hasten to say that one who could have read his thoughts would have found situation of ascanio and colombe depending as it did upon in his possession occupied the first place and that of himself a thing which he proposed to do in good time as to what was to be done for them had been meditating thus for half an hour more or less when the his cell opened once more and the turnkey appeared on the threshold are you the man who sent for a priest he growled to be sure i am said jacques deuce take me if i know what they all want with a damned monk the turnkey but what i do know is that they can t leave man in peace for five minutes come in come in father standing aside to allow the priest to pass and be it that he closed the door still grumbling and left the new with the prisoner was it you who sent for me my son the priest asked yes father replied the student do you wish to confess no not just that i wish to talk with you concerning a simple case say on my son said the priest seating himself upon the stool any feeble light that i can give you will help you it was to ask your advice that i ventured to send for you i am listening father said aubry i am a great sinner alas said the priest happy is the man who acknowledges it but that is not all not only am i a great sinner myself as i said i have led others into sin is there any way of undoing the harm you have done i think so father i think so she whom i dragged with me into the an innocent young girl you seduced her did you seduced yes father that is the word and you wish to atone for your sin that at least is my intention there is but one way to do it i know it well and that is why i have been undecided so long if two ways i would have chosen the other you wish to marry her one moment no i will not lie no father i do not wish to do it am resigned a warmer more devoted feeling would be much better what would you have father there are people who are born to marry others to remain single celibacy was my vocation and nothing my present situation i swear very well my son the sooner the better as you may repent of intentions what will be the earliest possible moment aubry asked dame said the priest as it is a marriage in extremis there no difficulty about the necessary dispensations and i think that after to morrow day after to morrow let it be said the student with a sigh but the young woman what of her will she consent to what to the marriage pardieu will she consent that she will with thanks aren t made to her every day then there is no obstacle none your parents absent and hers unknown her name gervaise perrette popinot do you wish me to tell her of your purpose if you will kindly take that trouble father i shall be she shall be informed this very day tell me father tell me could you possibly hand her a letter no my son we who are admitted to minister to the prisoners have deliver no message for them to any person until after their death that time comes i will do whatever you choose thanks it would be useless marriage it must be then you have nothing else to say to me nothing except that if you doubt the truth of what i say and if any objection to granting my request you will find in the the lieutenant criminal a complaint lodged by said gervaise which will prove that what i have said is the exact truth rely upon me to smooth away all obstacles replied the priest that jacques s proposed action was not prompted by the marriage but that he was yielding to necessity and two two days hence you will have restored her honor to the woman whose honor you her alas muttered the student with a deep sigh ah my son said the priest the more a sacrifice costs you pleasure it affords to god by mahomet s belly cried jacques in that case god should be to me go father go jacques had had to overcome very bitter opposition in his before arriving at such a resolution as he had told gervaise inherited his antipathy to the marriage tie from his father less than his friendship for ascanio and the thought that he who had caused his ruin together with the incentive afforded noblest examples of self sacrificing devotion to be found nothing less than all of this was necessary to bring him pitch of abnegation at which he had now arrived the reader may ask where lies the connection between the gervaise and aubry and the happiness of ascanio and colombe and aubry expect to save his friend by marrying his mistress to such i can only answer that the reader lacks penetration to reader may retort to be sure that it is not his business to quality in that case i beg him to take the trouble to read of this chapter which he might have passed over had he been a more subtle intellect the priest had gone aubry recognizing the impossibility back seemed to become more tranquil it is characteristic even the most momentous to bring tranquillity in the mind which has wrestled with its perplexity is at rest which has fought against its sorrow is as it were benumbed remained passive in his cell until having heard sounds in by ascanio which he supposed to be caused by the entrance jailer with his breakfast he concluded that they would surely in peace for a few hours he waited some little time after had ceased then crawled into his underground gallery it and raised the mat with his head s cell was plunged in most intense darkness called his friend s name in a low tone but there was no reply cell was untenanted s first feeling was one of joy ascanio was free and if free there was no need for him to but almost immediately what was said the night before about providing him quarters it was plain that the suggestion of madame d been heeded and the sounds he heard were caused by his friend moved s hope was as dazzling therefore but as evanescent as a lightning he let the mat fall and crawled backward into his cell source of consolation was taken from him even the presence of for whom he had sacrificed himself had no resource left but reflection but he had already reflected and his reflections had led to such a disastrous result that to sleep threw himself upon his bed and as he was very much in arrears in of sleep it was not long before he was entirely unconscious surroundings notwithstanding the perturbed condition of his mind dreamed that he was condemned to death and hanged but through of the hangman the rope was badly greased and his neck broken he was buried in due form none the less and in his beginning to gnaw his arms as men buried alive always do when determined to have his bit of rope came to secure it opened in which he was immured and restored his life and liberty it was only a dream and when the student awoke his life was great danger and his liberty altogether non existent evening the night and the next day passed away and brought him visitor than his jailer he tried to ask him a few questions not extract a word from him the middle of the second night as jacques was in the midst of sleep he was awakened with a start by the grinding of his its hinges however soundly a prisoner may be sleeping the an opening door always awakens him student sat up in bed up with you and dress yourself said the jailer s harsh voice could see by the light of the torch he held the halberds of the provost s guards behind him second branch of his order was unnecessary as the student s bed unprovided with bedclothes he had lain down where do you propose to take me pray demanded jacques still one eye you are very inquisitive said the jailer but i would like to know come come no arguing but follow me was useless so the prisoner obeyed jailer walked first then came aubry and the two guards brought rear of the procession looked around with an inquietude which he did not seek he feared a nocturnal execution but one thing comforted him saw no priest or hangman a few moments he found himself in the first room to which he at the time of his coming to the prison but instead of to the outer door which he hoped for an instant that they would do prone to illusions does misfortune render one his guide opened at one corner of the room and entered an inner corridor leading courtyard prisoner s first thought on entering the courtyard where he fresh air and saw the starlit sky was to fill his lungs and lay stock of oxygen not knowing when he might have another opportunity next moment he noticed the ogive windows of a fourteenth on the other side of the yard and began to suspect what was wind truth telling instinct of the historian compels us to state that thought his strength wellnigh failed him the memory of ascanio and colombe and the grandeur of sacrifice about to be consummated sustained him in his distress walked with a firm step toward the chapel and when he stood in everything was explained priest stood by the altar in the choir a woman was waiting was gervaise way up the choir he met the governor of the châtelet you desired to make reparation before your death to the young honor you stole from her your request was no more than just is granted cloud passed over the student s eyes but he put his hand over etampes s letter and his courage returned oh my poor jacques cried gervaise throwing herself into s arms oh who could have dreamed that this hour which i longed for would strike under such circumstances what wouldst thou have my dear gervaise cried the student upon his breast god knows those whom he should punish and he should reward we must submit to god s will take this he added beneath his breath slipping madame d etampes into her hand for benvenuto and for him alone what s that exclaimed the governor walking hastily toward them what s the matter nothing i was telling gervaise how i love her as she will not in all probability have time to ascertain protestations are thrown away go to the altar and and gervaise went forward in silence to the waiting priest were in front of him they fell upon their knees and the mass began would have been very glad of an opportunity to exchange a with gervaise who for her part was burning up with the express her gratitude to aubry but two guards stood beside to every word and watching every movement it was that a momentary feeling of sympathy led the governor to to exchange the embrace under cover of which the letter passed s hands to gervaise s that opportunity lost the to which they were subjected would have rendered jacques of no avail priest had received his instructions doubtless for he cut very short it may be too that he thought it would thrown away to enjoin due regard to his duties as a husband upon a man who was to be hanged within two or three days discourse at an end the benediction given the mass said aubry thought they would be allowed to speak together privately for but not so despite the tears of gervaise who was in them the guards forced them to part had time however to exchange a glance aubry s said remember gervaise s replied never fear it shall be done to night to morrow at latest they were led away in opposite directions gervaise was to the street door and jacques was politely taken back to the door closed upon him he heaved a deeper sigh than any of had perpetrated since he entered the prison he was married it was that aubry like another curtius plunged headlong into the hymeneal gulf with our readers permission we will leave the châtelet for and return to the hôtel de nesle workmen responded quickly to benvenuto s cries and followed him foundry all knew him as he appeared when at work but never had they an expression upon his face never such a flame in his eyes could have cast him in a mould at that moment as he was on of casting his jupiter would have endowed the world with statue ever created by the genius of an artist was ready the wax model in its envelope of clay girt iron bands was awaiting in the furnace which surrounded it of its life the wood was all arranged benvenuto set fire to it different places and as it was spruce which the artist had collecting that it might be thoroughly dry the fire every part of the furnace and the mould was soon the centre immense blaze the wax thereupon began to run out through holes while the mould was baking at the same time the workmen a long ditch beside the furnace into which the metal was to in a state of fusion for benvenuto was anxious not to lose and to proceed to the casting as soon as the mould baked a day and a half the wax trickled from the mould for a day and while the workmen divided into watches and took turn and like the sailors on a man of war benvenuto was constantly hovering about the furnace feeding the fire encouraging at last he found that the wax had all run out and that was thoroughly baked this completed the second part of his work last part was the melting of the bronze and the casting of when that stage was reached the workmen who were utterly comprehend such superhuman strength and such an intensity of passion to induce benvenuto to take a few hours rest but that so many hours added to ascanio s captivity and the persecution benvenuto refused he seemed to be made of the same bronze he was about to make a god the ditch was dug he wound stout ropes about the mould and aid of windlasses prepared for that purpose he raised it with precaution swung it out over the ditch and let it down it was on a level with the furnace he fixed it firmly in by piling around it the dirt taken from the ditch treading and putting in place as the dirt rose about the mould the earthen pipe which were to serve as air holes all these the rest of the day night came for forty eight hours not slept nor lain down nor even sat down the workmen implored scolded but benvenuto would hear none of it he seemed to by some more than human power and made no other reply to and scolding than to assign to each workman his task in stern tone of an officer manœuvring his troops was determined to begin the casting at once the who was accustomed to see all obstacles yield before him his imperious power upon himself he ordered his body to act it obeyed while his companions were obliged to withdraw one as in battle wounded soldiers leave the field and seek casting furnace was ready it was filled with round ingots of copper symmetrically piled one upon another so that the heat between them and the fusion be effected more quickly and he set fire to the wood around it as in the case of furnace and as it was mostly spruce the resin which exuded in conjunction with the combustible nature of the wood soon a fierce flame that it rose higher than was anticipated and roof of the foundry which took fire at once being of wood at of this conflagration and more especially at the heat which forth all the artist s comrades save hermann drew back and benvenuto were a host in themselves each of them seized and cut away at the wooden pillars which upheld the roof and in it fell in thereupon hermann and benvenuto with poles burning fragments into the furnace and with the increased heat began to melt benvenuto had at last reached the limit of his strength for hours he had not slept for twenty four he had not eaten the whole of that time he was the soul of the whole performance axis upon which the whole operation turned a terrible fever of him a deathly pallor succeeded to his usual high color an atmosphere so intensely hot that no one could live beside him his limbs tremble and his teeth chatter as if he were amid of lapland his companions remarked his condition and drew near he tried to resist to deny that he was beaten for in his eyes a disgrace to yield even before the impossible but at last he to confess that his strength was failing him fortunately was nearly accomplished the most difficult part of the past and what remained to be done was mere mechanical work pagolo pagolo did not reply but the workmen shouted his name and he at last appeared he said that he had been praying for issue of the casting this is no time to pray cried benvenuto and the lord said he prays this is the time for work pagolo hark ye i feel that dying but whether i die or not my jupiter must live pagolo to thee i intrust the management of the casting sure that do it as well as i if thou wilt understand pagolo the soon be ready thou canst not mistake the proper degree of heat it is red thou wilt give a sledge hammer to hermann and one le gaucher my god what was i saying ah yes then they out the two plugs of the furnace the metal will flow out and am dead you will tell the king that he promised me a boon and claim it in my name and that it is o my god i no what was i to ask the king ah yes ascanio seigneur colombe the provost s daughter d orbec madame d etampes ah going mad staggered and fell into hermann s arms who carried him a child to his room while pagolo intrusted with of the work gave orders for it to go on was right he was going mad or rather a terrible delirium possession of him scozzone who doubtless had been praying had hurried to his side but benvenuto continued to cry i i am dying ascanio ascanio what will become of ascanio thousand delirious visions were crowding in upon his brain ascanio stefana all appeared and disappeared like ghosts in which passed before his eyes was pompeo the goldsmith whom with his dagger and the keeper of the post house at sienna slew with his arquebus past and present were confounded in how it was clement vii who detained ascanio in prison again cosmo i who sought to force colombe to marry d orbec then he to queen eleanora thinking he was addressing madame d etampes would implore and threaten her by turns then he would make sport weeping scozzone and bid her beware lest pagolo should break clambering around on the cornices like a cat intervals of would succeed these paroxysms and it would seem as if at the point of death agonizing state of affairs endured three hours benvenuto was of his periods of torpor when pagolo suddenly rushed into the room and agitated crying may jesus and the virgin help us master for all is lost now and look nowhere but to heaven for help out half conscious dying as he was these words like a reached the very bottom of his heart the veil which intellect was torn away and like lazarus rising at the voice lord he rose upon his bed crying who dares to say that all is lost when benvenuto still lives alas i master said pagolo double traitor cried benvenuto is it written that thou prove false to me but never fear jesus and the virgin whom just now are at hand to bear aid to men of good will traitors that moment he heard the workmen lamenting and crying benvenuto benvenuto he is here he is here cried the artist rushing from his room face but with renewed strength and clearness of vision here he is woe to them who have not done their duty two hounds benvenuto was at the foundry he found all the workmen he had left so full of vigor and enthusiasm in a state of and dejection even hermann the colossus seemed to be fatigue he was tottering on his legs and was compelled to one of the supports of the roof which remained standing now listen to what i say cried benvenuto in an awful voice their midst like a thunderbolt i don t as yet know what but i swear to you beforehand that it can be remedied it may he upon my soul it can now that i am present obey your lives but obey passively without a word without a gesture the first man who hesitates i will kill so much for the ill disposed i have but one word to say to those who are disposed to do their duty liberty and happiness of ascanio your companion of whom you are fond will follow the successful issue of this task to work that cellini approached the furnace to form his own opinion of taken place the supply of wood had given out and the metal so that it had turned to cake as the professional phrase goes at once determined that the disaster could be repaired s watchfulness had relaxed in all likelihood and he had heat of the fire to abate the thing to be done was to make the hot as ever and to reduce the metal to a liquid state once more wood cried benvenuto wood go look for wood wherever it be found go to the bakers and buy it by the pound bring every stick of wood that there is in the house to chip break in the doors of the petit nesle hermann if doesn t choose to open them everything in that direction prize for it s an enemy s country wood wood set the example benvenuto seized an axe and attacked the two were still standing they soon fell with the last remnants of and benvenuto at once pushed the whole mass into the fire at time his comrades returned from all directions laden with wood ah cried benvenuto now are you ready to obey me yes yes cried every voice yes we will do whatever you bid us do long as we have a breath of life in our bodies select the oak then and throw on nothing but oak at first that quickly and consequently will repair the damage sooner oak began to rain down upon the fire and benvenuto to cry enough energy infected all his comrades his orders even his gestures understood and executed on the instant pagolo alone muttered to time between his teeth you are trying to perform impossibilities master it is which cellini s only reply was a look which seemed to say we have an account to settle hereafter notwithstanding pagolo s sinister predictions the to fuse anew and to hasten the fusion benvenuto at a quantity of lead into the furnace stirring up the lead and brass with a long bar of iron so that to borrow the metal corpse began to come to life again at sight progress that was making benvenuto was so elate that he of fever or weakness he too came to life once more last the metal began to boil and seethe benvenuto at once opened of the mould and ordered the plugs of the furnace to be which was done on the instant but as if this immense work was a veritable combat of titans to the end benvenuto perceived as the plugs were removed not only that the metal did not run but that there was some question as to whether there was it thereupon with one of those heaven sent inspirations which none but artists he cried let half of you remain here to feed the fire and the rest follow me that he rushed into the house followed by five of his men and later they all reappeared laden with silver plate pewter and pieces of work half completed benvenuto himself set and each one cast his precious burden into the furnace devoured everything bronze lead silver rough pig metal beautiful works of art with the same indifference with which have devoured the artist himself if he had thrown himself in to this reinforcement of fusible matter the metal liquefied and as if it repented of its began to flow freely there ensued a period of which became something very like terror when that all of the bronze did not reach the orifice of the mould sounded with a long rod and found that the mould was entirely exhausting the supply of metal he fell upon his knees and thanked god the work was was to save ascanio and colombe now would god permit that should fulfil his hopes was impossible to know until the following day night that followed was as can readily be imagined a night and worn out as benvenuto was he slept for a very few and his sleep even for those few moments was far from his eyes were hardly closed before real objects gave place ones he saw his jupiter the king of the gods in beauty as power as shapeless and deformed as his son vulcan in his was unable to understand this catastrophe was it the fault of was it the fault of the casting had he made a miscalculation destiny making sport of him at the sight his temples and he awoke with his heart jumping and bathed for some time his mind was so confused that he could fact from vision at last however he remembered that was still hidden in the mould like a child in its mother he recalled all the precautions he had taken he implored god to make his work successful but to do a merciful deed became somewhat calmer and fell asleep again under the weight never ending weariness which seemed to have laid hold on only to fall into a second dream as absurd and as terrifying first broke at last and with its coming benvenuto shook himself clear symptoms of drowsiness in an instant he was on his feet and and hastened at once to the foundry bronze was evidently still too hot to be exposed to the air was in such haste to ascertain what he had still to fear he might hope that he could not contain himself and began the head when he put his hand to the mould he was so pale would have thought him at the point of death are you still sick master inquired a voice which he recognized s you vould do much petter to stay in your ped you are wrong hermann my boy said benvenuto amazed to find so early for i should die in my bed but how happens it that out of bed at this hour i vas taking a valk said hermann blushing to the whites of his eyes i like much to valk shall i help you master no no cried benvenuto no one but myself is to touch the mould wait he began gently to uncover the head by a miraculous chance just the necessary amount of metal if it had not occurred to him all his silver plate and other objects into the furnace the have been missing and the casting a failure the head was not missing and was wonderfully beautiful illustration 07 sight of it encouraged benvenuto to expose the other portions of one after another little by little the mould fell away like bark at last jupiter freed from head to foot from his trammels all the majesty befitting the sovereign of olympus in no part of had the bronze betrayed the artist and when the last morsel fell away all the workmen joined in a shout of admiration had come out one by one and gathered about cellini who did notice their presence so absorbed was he by the thoughts to complete success gave rise at the shout which made him too a god he raised his head and a proud smile we shall see if the king of france will refuse the first boon asked man who has made such a statue next instant as if he repented his first impulse of pride entirely characteristic of him he fell upon his knees and hands rendered thanks to the lord aloud he was finishing his prayer scozzone ran out to say that madame aubry desired to speak to him in private having a letter husband which she could hand to none but benvenuto made scozzone repeat the name twice for he had no idea student was in the hands of a lawful wife obeyed the summons none the less leaving his companions swollen in their master s renown pagolo meanwhile on scrutinizing more closely observed that there was an imperfection in some accident having prevented the metal from filling every the mould and the same day that benvenuto removed his statue from the mould word to françois i that his jupiter was cast and asked him day it was his pleasure that the king of olympus should the king of france replied that his cousin the emperor and he were to hunt forest of fontainebleau on the following thursday and that he nothing more than have his statue transported to the grand gallery château on that day reply was very short it was evident that madame d etampes prejudiced the king against his favorite artist was it through pride or confidence in god said simply smile it is well was monday benvenuto caused the jupiter to be loaded upon a wagon rode beside it not leaving it for an instant lest some befall it on thursday at ten o clock statue and artist were any one who saw benvenuto though it were only to see him ride by evident that pride and radiant hope were triumphant in his heart conscience as an artist told him that he had executed chef d œuvre and his honest heart that he was about to perform action he was doubly joyous therefore and carried high like a man who having no hatred in his heart was fear the king was to see his jupiter and could not fail to with it montmorency and poyet would remind him of his promise emperor and the whole court would be present and françois do otherwise than as he had given his word to do d etampes with less innocent delight but with quite as passion was maturing her plans she had triumphed over the time of his first attempt to confound her by presenting her own hôtel and at the louvre the first danger was safely past she felt that the king s promise to benvenuto was a second danger and it was her purpose at any cost to induce his disregard it she therefore repaired to fontainebleau one day of cellini and laid her wires with the profound feminine in her case almost amounted to genius was destined very soon to feel its effects had no sooner crossed the threshold of the gallery where his to be exhibited than he felt the blow recognized the hand that it and stood for a moment overwhelmed gallery ordinarily resplendent with paintings by rosso which themselves enough to distract the attention from almost had been embellished during the last three days by from rome by primaticcio that is to say the marvels of the types sanctified by the admiration of twenty centuries there before him challenging comparison crushing all rivalry venus hercules apollo even jupiter himself the jove ideal figures dreams of genius eternities formed as it were a supernatural assemblage which it to approach a sublime tribunal whose judgment every dread was something like profanation and blasphemy in the thought jupiter insinuating himself into that olympus of down the gauntlet to phidias and notwithstanding his trust own merit the devout artist recoiled the immortal statues had taken possession of all the as it was their right to do and there was no place left s poor jupiter but some dark corner which could only be passing under the stately and imposing glances of the ancient gods stood in the doorway with bowed head and with an which sadness and artistic gratification were mingled messire antoine le maçon he said to the king s secretary who him i ought to and will send my jupiter back instantly will not attempt to contend with the masters the child attempt to contend with his parents my pride and my modesty benvenuto replied the secretary take the advice of a if you do that you are lost i tell you this that your enemies hope to discourage you and then to discouragement as a proof of your lack of skill it will be me to make excuses for you to the king his majesty who to see your work would refuse to listen and with etampes continually urging him to do it would withdraw his favor forever she anticipates that result and i fear it it s with not with the dead benvenuto that you have to contend you are right messire the goldsmith rejoined and i understand thank you for reminding me that i have no right to have esteem here that s all right benvenuto but let me give you one more bit madame d etampes is too fascinating to day not to have scheme in her head she took the king and the emperor off ride in the forest with irresistible playfulness and charm i for your sake that she will find a way to keep them there do you think it cried benvenuto turning pale why if she doing that i am lost for my statue would then have to be artificial light which would deprive it of half its merit let us hope that i am mistaken said le maçon and see what comes waited in painful suspense he placed his jupiter in a light as possible but he did not conceal from himself that its effect would be comparatively slight by twilight and nightfall it would be positively bad the duchess s hatred no less accurately than the artist s skill she anticipated a trick of the critics of the nineteenth century watched the sun sink toward the horizon with despair at and listened eagerly to every sound without the château the servants the vast structure was deserted o clock struck thenceforth the purpose of madame d etampes be mistaken and her success was beyond question benvenuto a chair utterly crushed all was lost his renown first of all feverish struggle in which he had been so near succumbing he had already forgotten because he had thought that it made sure would have no other result than to put him to shame sorrowfully at his statue around which the shadows of night beginning to fall and whose lines began to appear less pure an inspiration came to him he sprang to his feet jehan whom he had brought with him and rushed hastily from nothing had yet occurred to suggest the king s return hurried to a cabinet maker in the town and with and that of his workmen made in less than an hour a light colored oak with four rollers which turned in like casters trembled now lest the king should return too soon but at clock the work was completed night had fallen and the crowned not returned to the château madame d etampes wherever she was in a fair way to triumph a very short time benvenuto had the statue in place upon the stand jupiter held in his left hand the sphere world and in his right a little above his head the thunderbolt he seemed to be on the point of launching into space amid of the thunderbolt the goldsmith concealed a lamp preparations were hardly completed when a flourish of the return of the king and the emperor benvenuto lighted stationed little jehan behind the statue by which he was and awaited the king s coming not without trepidation by the violent beating of his heart minutes later the folding doors were thrown wide open and appeared leading charles v by the hand dauphin dauphine the king of navarre and the whole court two monarchs the provost his daughter and d orbec were among colombe was pale and dejected but as soon as she espied cellini raised her head and a smile of sublime confidence appeared upon and lighted up her face met her glance with one which seemed to say have no fear happens do not despair for i am watching over you the door opened little jehan at a signal from his master gave a slight push so that it moved softly forward upon its stand and leaving the antique statues behind went to meet so to speak as if it were alive every eye was at once turned direction the soft light of the lamp falling from above produced much more agreeable than daylight d etampes bit her lips methinks sire said she that the flattery is a little overdone it was for the king of earth to go to meet the king of heaven king smiled but it was easy to see that the flattery did not as his wont was he forgot the artist for his art saved the the journey by walking to meet it and examined it for a long silence charles v who was by nature an astute politician a great artist although he did one day in a moment of good humor up titian s pencil charles v and the courtiers who were to an opinion waited respectfully to hear that of pronouncing their own was a moment of silent suspense during which benvenuto and exchanged a glance of bitter hatred the king cried it is beautiful it is very beautiful and i confess that are surpassed every one overflowed in compliments and extravagant praise emperor first of all if one could conquer artists like cities said he to the king declare war on you instantly to win this one my cousin but after all interrupted madame d etampes in a rage we do look at the beautiful antique statues a little farther on somewhat more merit perhaps than our modern gewgaws king thereupon walked toward the antique statues which were below by the torches so that the upper portions were in shadow were beyond question much less effective than the jupiter phidias is sublime said the king but there may be a phidias in of françois i and charles v as there was in the age oh we must see it by daylight said anne bitterly to appear to not to be an artificial light is not art and what is that veil to conceal some defect master cellini tell us frankly referred to a very light drapery thrown over the statue to give majesty far benvenuto had remained beside his statue silent as cold as it but at the duchess s words he shot lightning from his black eyes and with the of a heathen artist snatched the veil away with his expected that the duchess would burst forth with renewed fury by an incredible exertion of her will power she smiled with and graciously held out her hand to cellini who was measure by this sudden change of tactics i was wrong she said aloud in the tone of a spoiled child you great sculptor cellini forgive my critical remarks give me and let us be friends henceforth what say you added in an undertone with extreme volubility think well of are about to ask cellini let it not be the marriage of colombe or i swear that colombe ascanio and yourself all three forever and suppose i request something else madame said benvenuto in tone will you second my request yes said she eagerly and i swear that whatever it may be will grant it i have no need to request the king s sanction to the marriage and ascanio for you will request it yourself madame duchess smiled disdainfully what are you whispering there said françois madame la duchesse d etampes benvenuto replied was obliging remind me that your majesty had promised to grant me a boon in were content with my work and the promise was made in my presence sire said the constable forward in my presence and chancelier poyet s indeed you colleague and myself remind you true constable interposed the king good humoredly true if to remember myself but i remember famously on my word so while it is perfectly agreeable to me is quite useless promised benvenuto to grant whatever boon he might ask when was cast was not that it constable have i a good memory it is for you to speak master cellini i am at but i beg you to think less of your own merit which than of our power which is limited we make no reservations our crown and our mistress very good sire said cellini since your majesty is so well your unworthy servitor i will ask for the pardon of a who fell into a dispute upon the quai du châtelet with de marmagne and in self defence passed his sword through s body one marvelled at the moderation of his request and etampes most of all she gazed at benvenuto with an air and as if she thought that she could not have by mahomet s belly exclaimed françois you do well to invoke of pardon in that matter for i heard the chancellor himself that it was a hanging affair oh sire cried the duchess i intended to speak to you that young man i have had news of marmagne who and who sent word to me that he sought the quarrel and what is the student s name master benvenuto jacques aubry madame la duchesse and the student continued madame d etampes hurriedly was in in the wrong and so sire instead of rebuking benvenuto at him grant his request promptly lest he repent of of modest very well said françois what you desire shall be done master he gives twice who gives quickly so says the proverb let to set this young man at liberty be despatched to night do my dear chancellor yes sire and your majesty shall be obeyed as to yourself master benvenuto said françois come to me at the louvre and we will adjust certain matters of detail you are interested and which have been somewhat neglected of my treasurer but your majesty knows that admission to the louvre very good very good the person who gave the order can rescind it a war measure and as you now have none but friends at court will be re established upon a peace footing as your majesty is in a granting mood said the duchess i pray grant a trifling request which i prefer although i did not make no said benvenuto in an undertone but you have often acted the danaë what is your request said françois who did not hear benvenuto say on madame la duchesse and be sure that the solemnity occasion can add nothing to my desire to be agreeable to you very well sire your majesty might well confer upon estourville the great honor of signing on monday next the of my young friend mademoiselle d estourville with orbec why i should be conferring no favor upon you by so doing king but i should afford myself a very great pleasure and remain your debtor i swear so it is agreed sire for monday asked the duchess for monday said the king madame la duchesse said benvenuto under his breath do you that the beautiful lily you ordered ascanio to execute is that you might wear it upon such an occasion of course i regret it was the reply but it s impossible is in prison very true but i am free i will finish it and bring it to madame oh upon my honor if you do that i will say you will say what madame i will say that you are a delightful man gave her hand to benvenuto who gallantly imprinted a kiss upon it asking the king s permission with a glance that moment a slight shriek was heard what is that the king asked sire i ask your majesty s pardon said the provost but my ill poor child murmured benvenuto she thinks that i have prudent would have returned to paris the same evening but the so persistent that he could not avoid remaining at the the following morning the rapidity of conception and promptness of decision which of him he determined to arrange for the next day dénouement of a transaction which he began long before it was matter which he wished to have off his hands devoting himself entirely to ascanio and colombe remained at the château to supper on that evening and until on the friday and not until noon did he set out on his accompanied by little jehan after taking leave of the king d etampes were well mounted and yet contrary to his wont cellini did his horse it was evident that he did not wish to enter a certain hour and it was seven o clock in the evening when at rue de la harpe instead of betaking himself at once to the hôtel de nesle called upon one of his friends named guido a physician and when he had made sure that his friend was at home conveniently entertain him at supper he ordered little jehan alone to say that he had remained at fontainebleau and would until the next day and to be ready to open the door when knock little jehan at once set out for the hôtel de nesle to abide by his instructions supper was served but before they took their places at the asked his host if he did not know some honest and skilful he could send for to prepare a contract that could not be assailed recommended his son in law who was immediately summoned arrived as they were finishing their supper some half hour later at once left the table closeted himself with him and draw up a marriage contract leaving the names in blank when read and re read the contract as drawn up to make sure that no flaw in it benvenuto paid him handsomely put the contract pocket borrowed from his friend a second sword of just the his own put it under his cloak and as it had become quite dark for the hôtel de nesle he reached his destination he knocked once but though he gently the door immediately opened little jehan was at his post questioned him the workmen were at supper and did not until the morrow he bade the child maintain the most as to his arrival then crept up to catherine s room to had retained a key entered softly closed the door behind the hangings and waited a short time he heard a light footstep on the staircase the a second time and scozzone entered lamp in hand she took from the outside locked the door placed the lamp on and sat down in a large arm chair so placed could see her face his vast astonishment that face formerly so open and joyous was sad and thoughtful the fact was that poor scozzone was throes of something very like remorse have seen her when she was happy and thoughtless then her so long as she was conscious of that love or rather of feeling in her lover s heart so long as the hope of becoming s wife some day was present like a golden cloud in all so long she maintained herself at the level of and made atonement for her past by her love but as she discovered that she had been deceived by appearances and she had mistaken for passion on cellini s part was at most a she descended the ladder of hope round by round benvenuto which had made that faded heart blossom anew was taken from her the heart lost its freshness once more her childish light heartedness her childish purity had her old nature powerfully assisted by ennui gently upper hand a newly painted wall keeps its colors in the sun them in the rain scozzone abandoned by cellini for some was no longer held to him save by a remnant of her pride had long paid court to her she spoke to cellini of his love that his jealousy would be aroused her expectation was cellini instead of losing his temper began to laugh and of forbidding her to see pagolo actually ordered her to thereafter she felt that she was entirely lost thereafter her life to chance with her former indifference and let about in the wind of circumstances like a poor fallen it was that pagolo triumphed over her indifference after all pagolo was young pagolo aside from his hypocritical expression a handsome youth pagolo was in love and was forever repeating that he loved her while benvenuto had long since ceased to tell the words i love you are the language of the heart and always feels the need of speaking that language more or with some one in a moment of idleness of anger perhaps of illusion told pagolo that she loved him she had told him so without him she had told him so with cellini s image in her heart name upon her lips it immediately occurred to her that the day might come weary of his mysterious unavailing passion would return and if he found her constant notwithstanding his express orders reward her devotion not by marriage for the poor girl had last illusion in that regard but by some remnant of esteem which she might take for a resurrection of his former love was such thoughts as these which made scozzone sad and thoughtful caused her to feel remorse the midst of her silent reverie she started and raised her head a light step on the stairway and the next moment a key turned in the lock and the door opened how did you come in who gave you that key pagolo she cried her chair there are only two keys to that door one is in and the other in cellini s ah my dear catherine laughed pagolo you re a capricious creature you open your door to a fellow and again you keep it closed when one attempts to enter by force even though you have given right to do it you threaten to call for help so you see i had to stratagem oh yes tell me that you stole the key from cellini without tell me that he doesn t know you have it for if he gave you i should die of shame and chagrin set your mind at rest my lovely catherine said pagolo locking and sitting down near the girl whom he forced to a seat no benvenuto doesn t love you it is true but he s like who have a treasure of which they make no use themselves they won t allow anybody else to touch no i made the key myself who can do great things can do small things tell me if i love you when my hands which are accustomed to making pearls bloom on golden stalks consented to shape an ignoble piece it is true wicked one that the ignoble piece of iron was a key that the key unlocked the door of paradise that pagolo would have taken catherine s hand but to the of cellini who did not lose a word or a gesture of catherine repulsed him well well said pagolo is this whim likely to last long pray look you pagolo said catherine in a melancholy tone which went s heart i know that when a woman has once yielded she has to draw back afterward but if the man for whom she has been has a generous heart when she says to him that she was acting faith at the time because she had lost her reason but that mistaken it is that man s duty believe me not to take an of her momentary error well pagolo i tell you this to you and yet i did not love you i loved another and cellini despise me you may indeed you ought but torment me pagolo good exclaimed pagolo good you arrange the matter upon my word after the time you compelled me to wait for with which you now reproach me you think that i will release a definite engagement which you entered into of your own free will no and when i think that you are doing all this for benvenuto man who is twice your age or mine for a man who doesn t love you a man who despises you for a man who treats you as a courtesan stop pagolo stop cried scozzone blushing with shame and rage benvenuto doesn t love me any more that is true but he me once and he esteems me still very good why doesn t he marry you as he promised to do promised never no benvenuto never promised to make me his wife he had promised he would have done it i aspired to mount so high the aspiration led me to hope that it might be so and when had once taken shape in my heart i could not confine it there and i boasted of a mere hope as if it were a reality no no continued catherine letting her hand fall into s with a sad smile no benvenuto never promised me aught then see how ungrateful you are scozzone cried pagolo seizing and mistaking what was simply a mark of dejection for a return you repulse me who have promised you and offered you all by your own admission never promised or offered you while convinced that if he were standing there he who betrayed you freely make to him the confession you so bitterly regret to me who love you so dearly oh if he were here cried scozzone if he were here pagolo remember that you betrayed him through hatred while i because i loved him and you would sink into the ground why so demanded pagolo bold as a lion because he believed be far away why so if you please hasn t every man the right a woman s love when that woman doesn t belong to another if he i would say to him you abandoned catherine poor catherine you so well she was in despair at first until she fell in with hearted worthy fellow who appreciated her at her true worth her and who promised her what you would never promise her her his wife he has inherited your rights and that woman him tell me catherine what reply your cellini could make none at all said a stern manly voice behind the absolutely none at all the same instant a powerful hand fell upon his shoulder nipped in the bud and threw him to the floor as pale and he had been boastful and rash a moment before was a strange picture pagolo on his knees bent double cheeks and deadly terror depicted on his features scozzone risen from her chair motionless and dumfounded like a statue and lastly benvenuto standing with folded arms a its sheath in one hand a naked sword in the other with in which irony and menace struggled for the mastery was a moment of awful silence pagolo and scozzone being beneath the master s frown treachery muttered pagolo treachery yes treachery on your part wretch retorted cellini you asked to see him pagolo said scozzone here he is yes here he is said the apprentice ashamed to be thus the woman he was so anxious to please but he is armed and no weapon i have brought you one said cellini stepping back and throwing sword he held in his left hand at pagolo s feet looked at the sword but made no movement come said cellini pick up the sword and stand up yourself i a duel muttered the apprentice whose teeth were chattering am i able to fight a duel on equal terms with you very well said cellini passing his weapon from one hand to i will fight with my left hand and that will make us equal i fight with you my benefactor you to whom i owe everything never smile of profound contempt overspread benvenuto s face while without seeking to conceal the disgust which showed itself expression you should have remembered my benefactions before stealing from me i intrusted to your honor and ascanio s said benvenuto has come back to you too late on guard pagolo on guard no no murmured the coward falling back upon his knees as you refuse to fight like an honest man said benvenuto i punish you as a scoundrel replaced his sword in its sheath drew his dagger and walked the apprentice without the slightest indication either of compassion upon his impassive features rushed between them with a shriek but benvenuto with a motion of his arm as irresistible as that of a endowed with life put her aside and the poor girl fell dead upon her chair benvenuto walked on toward pagolo who far as the wall there the master overtook him and said putting to his throat commend your soul to god you have five minutes to live mercy cried pagolo in an inarticulate voice do not kill me mercy what said cellini you know me and knowing me seduced the belonged to me i know all i have discovered everything and that i will spare you you are laughing at me pagolo you at me himself laughed aloud as he spoke but it was a strident laugh which made the apprentice shudder to his marrow master master cried pagolo as he felt the point of the his throat it was she not i yes she led me into it treachery cowardice and slander i will make a group of those some day said benvenuto and it will be a hideous thing she led you into it you reptile do you forget that i was here all that you said o benvenuto murmured catherine you know that he lies when he do you not yes yes said benvenuto i know that he lies when he says that lied when he said that he was ready to marry you but never fear be punished for the double lie yes punish me cried pagolo but be merciful punish me but do me you lied when you said that she led you into it yes i lied yes i am the guilty one i loved her madly and you know what love will lead a man to do you lied when you said that you were ready to marry her no no master then i didn t lie so you really love scozzone oh yes indeed i love her replied pagolo realizing that the of lessening his guilt in cellini s eyes was to attribute his the violence of his passion yes i love her and you say again that you were not lying when you proposed to i was not lying master you would have made her your wife if she had not belonged to you yes very well then take her i give her to you what do you say you are joking are you not no i never spoke more seriously look at me if you doubt it glanced furtively at cellini and saw plainly in his face judge might at any moment give place to the executioner he head therefore with a groan take that ring from your finger pagolo and put it on catherine s passively obeyed the first portion of the order and to scozzone to draw near she obeyed put out your hand scozzone continued benvenuto she obeyed now do the rest placed the ring upon scozzone s finger now said benvenuto that the betrothal is duly accomplished we to the marriage marriage muttered pagolo we can t be married in this way we notaries and a priest we must have a contract rejoined benvenuto producing the under his orders here is one all ready in which the need to be inserted placed the contract upon a table took up a pen and handed it sign pagolo said he sign ah i have fallen into a trap muttered the apprentice eh what s that exclaimed benvenuto without raising his voice to it an ominous accent a trap where is the trap in this i urge you to come to scozzone s room did i advise you to tell you wished to make her your wife very good make her your wife and when you are her husband our rôles will be changed if to her room it will be your turn to threaten and mine to oh that would be too absurd cried catherine passing from to hysterical gayety and laughing aloud at the idea which s words evoked reassured by the turn cellini s threats had taken and s peals of laughter pagolo began to look at matters a reasonably it became plain to him that cellini wished to into a marriage for which he felt but little inclination therefore that would be rather too tragic of the comedy and that he might perhaps with a make a better bargain yes he muttered translating scozzone s gayety into words yes be very amusing i agree but unfortunately it cannot be what it cannot be cried benvenuto as amazed as a lion might be a fox demurring to his will no it cannot be pagolo repeated i prefer to die kill me words were hardly out of his mouth when cellini was upon him the dagger gleaming in the air and threw himself to one side and successfully that the blow which was intended for him his shoulder and the blade impelled by the goldsmith s penetrated the wainscoting to the depth of several inches i consent cried pagolo mercy cellini i consent i am ready to and while the master was withdrawing the dagger which in contact with the wall behind the wainscoting he ran to where the contract lay seized the pen and wrote his name affair had taken place so rapidly that scozzone had no time part in it thanks pagolo said she wiping away the tears which terror to her eyes and at the same time repressing an inclination thanks dear pagolo for the honor you consent to confer but it s better that we should understand each other thoroughly now listen to me just now you would have none of me and now i will of you i don t say this to mortify you pagolo but i do not and i desire to remain as i am in that case said benvenuto with the utmost coolness if you won him scozzone he must die why cried catherine it is i who refuse him he must die rejoined benvenuto it shall not be said that a me and went unpunished are you ready pagolo catherine cried the apprentice catherine in heaven s name on me catherine i love you catherine i will love you always catherine catherine be my wife i beg you on my knees come scozzone decide quickly said cellini oh said catherine pouting tell me master don t you think you hard on me who have loved you so dearly and who have dreamed so different but cried the fickle child passing melancholy to merriment once more mon dieu cellini see what face poor pagolo is making oh for heaven s sake put lugubrious expression pagolo or i will never consent to take my husband really you are too absurd save me first catherine said pagolo then we will laugh if oh well my poor boy if you really and truly wish it yes indeed i do you know what i have been you know what i am yes i know you are not deceived in me no you will not regret it no no then give me your hand it s very ridiculous and i hardly expected it no matter i am your wife took the pen and signed as a dutiful wife should do below s signature thanks catherine thanks cried pagolo you will see how happy make you if he is false to that promise said benvenuto write to me and wherever i may be i will come in person to remind him he spoke cellini slowly pushed his dagger back into its sheath his eyes fixed upon the apprentice then he took the contract it neatly and put it in his pocket and said to pagolo with sarcasm which was characteristic of him now friend pagolo although you and scozzone are duly to the laws of men you are not in god s sight and the not sanctify your union until to morrow until then your would be in contravention of all laws divine and human pagolo turned pale as death but as benvenuto pointed imperatively door he backed out of the room no one but you cellini would ever have had such an idea as that catherine laughing as if she would die hark ye my poor pagolo said as he opened the door i let you go because the law but never fear pagolo i swear by the blessed virgin that when my husband no man not even benvenuto himself will find me a virtuous wife o cellini she added gayly when the door was closed you give me but relieve me of his presence for to day it is so much you owed me this reparation of days after the scene we have described a scene of quite was in preparation at the louvre the day appointed for signing the contract had arrived it o clock in the morning when benvenuto left the hôtel de nesle straight to the louvre and with anxious heart but firm the grand staircase the reception room into which he was first ushered he found and d orbec who were conferring with a notary in the corner pale and motionless as a statue was seated on the other the room staring into vacancy they had evidently moved away so that she could not hear and the poor child had remained placed her passed in front of her and let these words fall upon her have courage i am here recognized his voice and raised her head with a cry of joy she had time to question her protector he had already adjoining room usher drew aside a tapestry portière and the goldsmith passed king s cabinet less than these words of cheer would have availed to s courage the poor child believed that she was abandoned lost messire d estourville had dragged her thither despite her faith in god and in benvenuto as they were she was conscious of such a feeling of despair at her heart implored madame d etampes to allow her to enter a convent renounce ascanio provided that she might be spared comte d orbec duchess wanted no half victory in order that her purpose might it was essential that ascanio should believe in the his beloved and so she sternly refused to listen to poor colombe thereupon colombe summoned all her courage remembering bade her be strong and brave even at the altar s foot occasional sinkings of the heart allowed herself to be taken to where the king was to sign the contract at noon again her strength failed her for a moment for but three remained to touch the king s heart with her prayers to arrive or to die of grief had come benvenuto had told her to hope and colombe revived once more entering the king s cabinet cellini found madame d etampes alone all that he desired he would have solicited the honor of seeing she not been there duchess was thoughtful in her hour of triumph and yet with letter burned burned by herself she was fully convinced that nothing to fear but although she was reassured as to her power with dismay the perils that threatened her love it thus with the duchess when the anxiety attendant upon was at rest the ardent passions of her heart devoured her in which pride and passion were mingled was to make while making him happy but she knew now that ascanio although origin for the gaddis to which family he belonged of long standing at florence aspired to no other glory of being a great artist his hopes were ever fixed upon anything it was some vase or ewer or statue if he ever longed for diamonds it was so that he might make of them by setting them in lovelier flowers than those which heaven waters with its dew and honors were nothing to him if they did not flow from his and were not the guerdon of his personal renown what part a useless dreamer play in the active agitated life of the duchess the first storm the delicate plant would be destroyed with which it already bore and the fruit of which it gave promise be that he would allow himself to be drawn into the schemes of mistress through discouragement or through indifference but case a pale and melancholy shadow he would live only in of the past ascanio in fine appeared to the etampes as he really was an exquisite fascinating personality as he remained in a pure untroubled atmosphere he was an who would never become a man he could devote himself but never to ideas born to enjoy the outpourings of affection he would inevitably go down in the first of the struggle for supremacy and power he was the man needed madame d etampes s passion but not to keep pace with her in schemes was the tenor of her reflections when benvenuto entered the her thought hovering about her darkened her brow two adversaries eyed each other narrowly the same satirical upon their lips at the same time the glances they twin brothers and indicated that they were equally prepared struggle and that the struggle would be a desperate one well and good he is a rough fighter thought anne whom it will be to overcome a foeman worthy of my steel but to day there are truth too many chances against him and there will be no great overthrowing him beyond question madame d etampes said benvenuto to himself you masterful woman and more than one contest with a strong man has less trouble than this i have entered upon with you you may be sure that while fighting courteously i shall none the less all the weapons at my disposal was a moment s silence while the combatants delivered these brief monologues aside the duchess was the first to break you are punctual master cellini said she his majesty is to d orbec s contract at noon and it is now only a quarter permit me to make his majesty s excuses he is not behindhand you are beforehand i am very happy madame that i arrived too early as my me the honor of a tête à tête with you an honor i requested most urgently had not chance to which i return anticipated my wishes good lack benvenuto said the duchess does defeat incline you not my own defeat madame but that of other persons i have it peculiarly meritorious to pay my court to one in disgrace here is the proof of it madame he spoke benvenuto drew from beneath his cloak ascanio s which he had completed that morning the duchess exclaimed and delight never had her eyes beheld such a marvellous jewel did one of the flowers found in the enchanted gardens of thousand and one nights so dazzle the eyes of peri or fairy ah cried the duchess putting forth her hand to take the flower me benvenuto but i confess that i did not rely upon why should you not rely upon it madame laughed benvenuto me oh if you had promised to perform a revengeful instead of a i should have been much more certain that you would redeem punctually who told you that i did not promise both retorted benvenuto his hand so that the lily was still in his control i do not understand you said the duchess do you not think said benvenuto pointing to the diamond the heart of the flower the diamond which she owed to the of charles v that when mounted in the guise of a dewdrop earnest given to bind a certain bargain which is to set off of milan from france has a fine effect you speak in enigmas my dear goldsmith unfortunately the king be here and i haven t time to guess them i will tell you the answer then it is an old proverb verba volant manent which being interpreted means what is written ah that s where you are in error my dear goldsmith what is burned so do not think to frighten me as you would a child and the lily which belongs to me one instant madame i ought to warn you that while it is a in my hands it will lose all its virtue in yours my work more valuable than you think where the multitude sees only we artists sometimes conceal an idea do you wish me to show idea madame nothing is easier look all that is necessary is this invisible spring the stalk opens as you see and in of the flower we find not a gnawing worm as in some and some false hearts but something similar worse it the dishonor of the duchesse d etampes written with her own signed by her he spoke benvenuto pressed the spring opened the stalk and the letter he slowly unfolded it and showed it open to pale with wrath and stricken dumb with dismay you hardly expected this did you madame said benvenuto coolly the letter once more and replacing it in the lily if you ways madame you would be less surprised a year ago i concealed in a statuette a month ago i concealed a maiden in a statue was there that i could hide away in a flower to day a bit that was all and that is what i have done but that letter cried the duchess that infernal letter i my own hands i saw the flame and touched the ashes did you read the letter you burned no no madwoman that i was i did not read it that is too bad for you would be convinced now that the letter of will make as much flame and ashes as the letter of a duchess why then ascanio the dastard deceived me oh madame pray pause do not suspect that pure and innocent child even if he had deceived you would have done no more than you the weapons you used against him oh no no he did you he would not purchase his own life or colombe s by deceit he was himself deceived by whom pray tell me that by a mere boy a student the same who wounded your trusty retainer de marmagne by one jacques aubry in short whom it is the vicomte de marmagne has mentioned to you yes murmured the duchess yes marmagne did tell me that this jacques aubry was seeking to gain access to ascanio to secure that letter and it was after that you paid ascanio a visit but students you know and ours had already anticipated you as you left d etampes he was creeping into his friend s cell and as it he went out but i didn t see him i saw nobody one doesn t think to look everywhere if you had done so you would course have raised a certain mat and under that mat would a hole communicating with the adjoining cell but ascanio ascanio when you entered he was asleep was he not yes very good during his sleep aubry to whom he had refused to give took it from his coat pocket and put a letter of his own in you were misled by the envelope and thought that you a note from madame la duchesse d etampes not so madame an epistle penned by mademoiselle gervaise perrette popinot but this aubry who wounded marmagne this clown who almost murdered will pay dear for his insolence he is in prison and death he is free madame and owes his freedom in great measure to you how so why who but he was the poor prisoner whose pardon you joined me upon king françois oh insane fool that i was muttered the duchess biting her lips blood ran she looked benvenuto squarely in the eye for a moment continued in a panting voice on what condition will you give me that letter i think i have allowed you to guess madame i am not skilled in guessing tell me you must ask the king to bestow colombe s hand upon ascanio go to rejoined anne with a forced laugh you little know d etampes master goldsmith if you fancy that my love to threats you did not reflect before answering me madame i stand by my answer however kindly permit me to sit down unceremoniously madame and to with you a moment said benvenuto with the peculiar to superior men i am only an humble sculptor are a great duchess but let me tell you that notwithstanding which separates us we were made to understand each other assume those queenly airs they will have no effect it is not to insult you but to enlighten you and your haughty manner of place because your pride is not at stake you are a strange man upon my word said anne laughing in spite say on i am listening i was saying madame la duchesse continued benvenuto coolly that the difference in our fortunes our positions are almost and that we could understand each other and perhaps each other you cried out when i suggested that you ascanio it seemed to you impossible and mad and yet i had an example madame an example yes as you love ascanio i loved colombe you i i loved her as i had never loved but once i would have given my life my soul for her and yet i gave her to ascanio truly a most unselfish passion sneered the duchess oh do not make my suffering matter for raillery madame do not my agony i have suffered keenly but i realized that the child more made for me than ascanio for you listen madame we are both i may be pardoned for the comparison of those exceptional natures which lead an existence of their own have feelings peculiar to themselves and rarely find themselves in others we both obey madame a sovereign idol the worship has expanded our hearts and placed us higher than mankind to you ambition is all in all to me art now our divinities and exert their sway always and everywhere you desired a crown i desired colombe as a galatea you loved as a duchess i artist you have persecuted i have suffered oh do not think wrong you in my thoughts i admire your energy and sympathize audacity let the vulgar think what they will from your point it is a great thing to turn the world upside down in order to place for the person one loves i recognize therein a strong passion and i admire characters capable of such but i also admire superhuman characters for everything foresight everything outside the beaten paths has an me even while i loved colombe madame i considered that unruly nature would be ill mated with that pure colombe loved ascanio my harmless sweet natured pupil my rough temperament would have frightened her thereupon in a loud tone i bade my love hold its peace and as it remonstrated to my assistance my art divine and by our united efforts the rebellious passion and held it down then sculpture my only mistress touched my brow with her burning lips and i do as i have done madame la duchesse leave these their angel loves and do not disturb them in their heaven our earth with its sorrows its conflicts and its seek a refuge against suffering in ambition unmake empires your thoughts play with the kings and masters of the world yourself that would be well done and i would applaud but do not wreck the peace and happiness of these who love each other with such a pure sweet love before of god and the virgin mary who are you master benvenuto cellini i do not know you said in blank amazement who are you vrai dieu a man among men as you are a woman among women goldsmith laughing with his customary frankness and if you do me you see that i have a great advantage over you for i do madame it may be so said the duchess but it is my opinion that a women loves better and more earnestly than a man among men snaps her fingers at your superhuman abnegation and defends with beak and claws to the last gasp you persist then in refusing to give ascanio to colombe i persist in loving him myself so be it but if you will not yield with good grace beware i rough when i am roused and may make you cry out a little mêlée you have reflected fully have you not you refuse all your consent to the union of ascanio and colombe most emphatically yes very good to our posts cried benvenuto for the battle is on that moment the door opened and an usher announced the king love appeared on the threshold giving his hand to diane with whom he had come from the bedside of his sick son diane by her hatred had a vague feeling that her rival with humiliation and did not choose to miss the for the king he saw nothing suspected nothing he believed etampes and benvenuto to be entirely reconciled and as he saw together when he entered he saluted them both at once with smile and the same inclination of the head good morrow my queen of beauty good morrow my king of artists what are you talking about so confidentially you seem both to interested mon dieu sire we are talking politics said benvenuto and what particular subject exercises your faculties tell me i beg the question which engrosses everybody at present sire continued ah the duchy of milan yes sire well what were you saying of it we do not agree sire one of us maintains that the emperor might to give you the duchy of milan and yet redeem his promise it to your son charles which of you makes that suggestion i think that it was madame d etampes sire duchess became pale as death if the emperor should do that it would be infamous treachery but he ll not do it in any event even if he does not do it said diane joining in it will not be i am assured for lack of advice to that effect given by whom cried the king by mahomet s belly i would be glad by whom bon dieu do not be so disturbed sire rejoined benvenuto we as we said other things simple conjectures put forward by us talk madame la duchesse and i are but bungling politicians madame la duchesse is too much of a woman to think of aught toilet although she has no need to think of that and i sire much of an artist to think of aught beside art is it not so duchesse the truth is my dear cellini said françois that each of you glorious a part to play to envy others aught that they may have though it were the duchy of milan madame la duchesse d etampes by virtue of her beauty and you are king by virtue of king sire yes king and although you haven t as i have three lilies in you have one in your hand which seems to me to be lovelier that ever blossomed in the brightest sunlight or upon the in all heraldry this lily is not mine sire it belongs to madame d etampes my pupil ascanio to make it but as he could not finish it as i realized madame d etampes s desire to have so rich a jewel possession i set to work myself and finished it wishing with heart to make it the symbol of the treaty of peace which we other day in your majesty s presence it is marvellously beautiful said the king putting out his hand it is it not sire rejoined benvenuto withdrawing it as if and the young artist whose chef d œuvre it is to be magnificently rewarded such is my purpose interposed the duchess i have in store for him which a king might envy him but you know madame that the recompense to which you refer it is is not that upon which his heart is fixed what would madame we artists are whimsical creatures and often the would as you say arouse a king s envy is viewed by us eye nevertheless said madame d etampes as an angry flush overspread he must be content with what i have set apart for him for i told you benvenuto that i would accord him no other save last extremity very well you may confide to me what his wishes are said benvenuto once more putting out his hand for the lily and if it too difficult a matter we will try to arrange it observe the jewel carefully sire said benvenuto placing the the flower in the king s hand examine it in detail and will see that any compensation whatsoever must fall short of of such a masterpiece he spoke benvenuto darted a keen glance at the duchess but control was so perfect that not a muscle of her face moved as the lily pass from the artist s hand to the king s t is really miraculous said the king but where did you find diamond which glistens in the heart of the flower i did not find it sire replied cellini with charming affability madame d etampes furnished it to my pupil i was not aware that you owned this diamond madame whence came it hands pray why probably from the place where most diamonds come from sire mines of guzarate or golconda there is a long story connected with that diamond sire and if cares to hear it i will tell it you the diamond and i are for this is the third time it has passed through in the first place i set it in the tiara of our holy father where its effect was marvellous then by order of clement vii it upon a missal which his holiness presented to the v and as the emperor desired to carry it constantly about him a resource doubtless in an emergency i set the diamond which more than a million in a ring sire hid not your majesty on the hand of your cousin the emperor yes i remember cried the king yes on the day of our he had it on his finger how comes the diamond in duchess yes tell us cried diane whose eyes shone with joy how came that a diamond of that value passed from the emperor s hands if the question were put to you madame retorted madame d etampes the answer would not be far to seek assuming that you confess to any other than your confessor you do not answer the king s question madame rejoined diane yes said françois how comes the diamond in your possession ask benvenuto said madame d etampes hurling a last defiance at benvenuto will tell you tell me then said the king and instantly i am weary of waiting very good sire said benvenuto i must confess to your majesty sight of this diamond strange suspicions awoke in my mind as it was while madame d etampes and myself were at enmity you and i should not have been sorry to learn some little secret injure her in your majesty s eyes so i followed the scent and you learned glanced hastily at the duchess and saw that she was smiling power of resistance which she manifested pleased him and putting an end to the struggle brutally with one stroke he prolong it like au athlete sure of victory in the end who in with an antagonist worthy of him resolves to display all and all his skill you learned the king repeated i learned that she purchased it of manasseh the jew yes sire and govern yourself accordingly it seems that since he your cousin the emperor has scattered so much money along that he is reduced to putting his diamonds in pawn and etampes with royal magnificence gathers in what the imperial retain ah by my honor as a gentleman t is most diverting cried françois flattered in his vanity as lover and in his jealousy as king but fair lady he added addressing the duchess methinks you ruined yourself in order to make such an acquisition and it is to repair the disordered state of your finances remember that we debtor to the value of the diamond for it is so magnificent that determined that it shall come to you from a king s hand at least from an emperor s thanks benvenuto said the duchess in an undertone i begin as you claim that we were made to understand each other what are you saying cried the king oh nothing sire i was apologizing to the duchess for my which she deigns to pardon a favor which is the on her part in that the lily gave birth to another suspicion what was that demanded the king while diane whose hate was too allow her to be deceived by this comedy devoured her with her eyes d etampes saw that she was not yet quit of her indefatigable foe a shadow of dread passed across her face but it should be said to her courage only to disappear immediately she availed herself of the king s preoccupation caused s words to try to gain possession of the lily but placed himself between the king and her what was the suspicion oh the goldsmith said with a smile it infamous that i am not sure that i shouldn t be ashamed of it and that it would not add to my offence to be so shameless as it i must have an express command from your majesty before dare dare cellini i command you said the king so be it in the first place said cellini i confess with s candid pride that i was surprised to see madame d the apprentice with a task which the master would have and proud to execute for her you remember my apprentice ascanio he is a charming youth who might venture to pose for endymion my word well what then said the king his brows contracting at the began to gnaw his heart time it was evident that for all her self control etampes was on the rack in the first place she read in the eyes of diane de poitiers and in the second place well aware that while françois might have forgiven treason to he certainly would not forgive infidelity to the lover however if he did not notice her agony benvenuto continued i reflected upon the beauty of my ascanio and it occurred forgive me mesdames if there was anything in the thought to cast a reflection upon the french but i am accustomed to of our italian princesses who in love it must be confessed weak creatures it occurred to me that a sentiment which had with art master said françois frowning darkly reflect before you speak i apologized beforehand for my temerity and asked to be permitted my peace i bear witness to that said diane you yourself bade him speak and now that he has begun it is always time to stop said madame d etampes when one knows one is about to say is a falsehood i will stop if you choose madame said benvenuto you know that but to say the word yes but i choose that he shall continue you are right diane matters here which must be probed to the bottom say on monsieur on said the king keeping his eyes fixed upon the sculptor and my conjectures were taking a wide range when an incredible a new field to them what was it cried the king and diane de poitiers in the same breath i am getting in very deep whispered cellini to the duchess sire said she you do not need to hold the lily in your hand to this long discourse your majesty is so accustomed to hold in a firm grasp that i fear the fragile flower may be broken fingers she spoke the duchess with one of those smiles which belonged alone put out her hand to take the jewel forgive me madame la duchesse said cellini but as the lily important part throughout my story permit me to enforce my ocular demonstration the lily plays an important part in the story you have to tell cried diane snatching the flower from the king s hand with swift as thought in that case madame d etampes is right the story is at all what i suspect it is much better that the be in my hands than in yours sire for purposely or not might by some uncontrollable impulse break it d etampes became terribly pale for she deemed herself lost seized benvenuto s hand and her lips opened to speak immediately she thought better of it her hand let the artist and her lips closed again say what you have to say she muttered through her if you dare she added in so low a tone that benvenuto hear yes and measure your words my master said the king and do you madame measure your silence said benvenuto we are waiting cried diane unable to restrain her impatience fancy sire and you madame fancy that ascanio and madame la etampes corresponded duchess looked about to see if there were not at hand some which she could silence the goldsmith s tongue forever corresponded echoed the king yes corresponded and the most extraordinary thing is that the this correspondence between madame la duchesse d etampes and carver s apprentice was love the proofs master you have proofs i trust cried the king in o mon dieu yes sire replied benvenuto your majesty that i should not have allowed myself to form such proofs produce them instantly then said the king when i say that i have them i am in error your majesty had them since i cried the king and madame de poitiers has them now i cried diane yes rejoined benvenuto who amid the king s wrath and the terror of the two most powerful women in the world was and complacent yes for the proofs are in the lily in the lily cried the king snatching the flower from the hands de poitiers and examining it with a careful scrutiny in of art had no share in this lily yes sire in the lily benvenuto repeated you know that it is so he continued in a meaning tone toward the gasping duchess let us come to terms she whispered colombe shall not orbec that is not enough returned cellini ascanio must marry colombe never exclaimed madame d etampes the king was turning the fatal lily over and over in his suspense and wrath being the more poignant in that he express them openly the proofs are in the lily in the lily he repeated but i can in the lily because your majesty does not know the secret of opening it there is a secret show it me messire on the instant or rather made a movement as if to crush the flower but both out and he checked himself oh sire it would be a pity cried diane such a charming toy to me sire and i promise you that if there is a secret i will slender active fingers to which hatred lent additional subtlety over all the rough places on the jewel felt in all the hollows the duchesse d etampes half fainting followed with haggard investigations which for a moment were without result but at last by good luck or a rival s instinct of divination diane precise spot on the stalk flower opened two women cried out again at the same moment one with joy with dismay the duchess darted forward to tear the lily s hand but benvenuto held her back with one hand while with he showed her the letter which he had taken from its hiding place swift glance at the flower showed her that the hiding place was empty i agree to everything said the duchess completely crushed and to maintain such a contest on the gospel said benvenuto on the gospel well master said the king impatiently where are the proofs i recess very cleverly hollowed out in the stalk but there is it no sire there is nothing said benvenuto true but there might have been something suggested diane madame is right said benvenuto master cried the king through his clenched teeth do you know that be dangerous for you to prolong this pleasantry and that than you have repented playing with my anger for that reason i should be in despair were i to incur it sire cellini without losing his composure but there is nothing present circumstances to arouse it for i trust your majesty did my words seriously should i have dared to bring so grave so lightly madame d etampes can show you the letters contained if you are curious to see them they are in with love but it is the love of my poor ascanio for a a passion which at first seems insane and impossible but my ascanio like the true artist he is fancying that jewel falls not far short of equalling in value a applied to madame d etampes as to a special providence and lily his messenger now you know sire that providence can and you will not be jealous of this particular one i fancy while doing a kindly action she attributes part of the credit that is the solution of the enigma sire and if all the the bush i have indulged in has offended your majesty i pray forgive me in consideration of the familiarity to which you have pleased to admit me quasi academic harangue changed the face of affairs as on diane s brow grew dark while the wrinkles vanished from madame d etampes and the king resumed his smiling good humor had finished forgive me fair duchess said françois for having dared to for an instant tell me what i can do to redeem my offence and forgiveness grant the request which madame la duchesse d etampes is about to make your majesty heretofore granted the one that i made speak for me master cellini since you know what it is that i wish the duchess with better grace than cellini would have very well since madame la duchesse appoints me to be her mouthpiece you must know that she desires your all powerful intervention of poor ascanio s passion yes yes laughed the king i agree with all my heart to assist the comely apprentice a happy man what is the name of colombe d estourville sire colombe d estourville cried françois i pray your majesty to remember that it is madame d etampes this request come madame add your prayers to mine causing a corner of the letter to protrude from his pocket you are silent much longer his majesty will think that you make solely from a desire to oblige me is it true that you desire this marriage madame inquired françois yes sire murmured madame d etampes i do desire it earnestly adverb was extracted by a fresh exhibition of the letter but how do i know said the king that the provost will accept son in law a nameless penniless youth in the first place sire benvenuto replied the provost being subject will surely have no other will than his king s in place ascanio is not nameless he is a gaddo gaddi and one ancestors was podesta of florence he is a goldsmith it is true in italy it is no disgrace to belong to that guild furthermore if he could boast of no ancient nobility as i am at liberty his name in the letters patent which have been forwarded to me majesty s directions he will be a nobleman of recent creation oh not that it requires any sacrifice on my part to resign in to reward my ascanio is to reward myself twice over so it sire that he is seigneur de nesle and i will not let him money he may if he will lay aside his profession and buy of lances or an appointment at court i will provide and we shall look to it you may be sure that your generosity does your purse too much then i may consider sire ascanio gaddo gaddi seigneur de nesle let it be cried the king heartily the certainty that madame d etampes was faithful had put him in a joyous humor madame said cellini in an undertone you cannot in conscience seigneur de nesle at the châtelet it was well enough for ascanio d etampes called an officer of the guards and whispered a the concluding ones being these in the king s name what are you doing madame demanded françois madame d etampes is simply sending a messenger for the bridegroom to be sire interposed cellini where where madame d etampes who knew the king s kindness of heart bade your majesty s pleasure minutes later the door of the apartment opened in which colombe the provost d orbec the spanish ambassador the whole court except marmagne who was still confined to an usher cried the king i entered leading diane de poitiers and followed upon one of whose arms was leaning the duchesse d etampes on the other ascanio each of them being as pale as the other the announcement made by the usher all the courtiers turned and paralyzed for a moment when they saw this strange group astonishment redoubled when the king stepping aside to allow to pass in front of him said in a loud voice master benvenuto take our place for the moment and our authority as if you were the king and be obeyed as a king should be beware sire replied the goldsmith in order to fill your i propose to be magnificent go on benvenuto said françois laughingly every magnificent be a bit of flattery for me very good sire that puts me at my ease and i will praise you as i can do not forget he continued all you who hear me that is speaking by my mouth messieurs les notaires you have contract which his majesty deigns to sign insert the names of parties two notaries seized their pens and made ready to write the names two copies of the contract one of which was to remain in and the other in their office of the one part continued cellini the noble and colombe d estourville colombe d estourville repeated the notaries mechanically while listened in open mouthed astonishment of the other part continued cellini the most noble and gaddi seigneur de nesle ascanio gaddi cried the provost and d orbec in the same breath a mere artisan added the provost bitterly turning toward the king ascanio gaddi seigneur de nesle repeated benvenuto unmoved his majesty bestows letters of naturalization and the office of the royal châteaux if his majesty so commands i will obey said the provost but ascanio gaddi continued benvenuto out of regard for whom grants to messire robert d estourville provost of paris of chamberlain sire i am ready to sign said d estourville vanquished at last mon dieu mon dieu murmured colombe falling back into her chair all this a dream and what of me cried d orbec as for you rejoined cellini continuing his royal functions as comte d orbec i spare you the inquiry which i should be ordering into your conduct clemency is a kingly virtue no less is it not sire but here are the contracts all prepared us sign messieurs let us sign he plays the king to perfection cried françois as happy as on a vacation passed the pen to ascanio who signed with a trembling hand passed the pen to colombe to whose assistance madame diane in pure kindness of heart the hands of the lovers met and swooned came madame diane who passed the pen to the duchesse d etampes passed it to the provost the provost to d orbec and d orbec to ambassador all these great names cellini wrote his own in a firm and yet he was not the one who had made the least writing his name the spanish ambassador drew nigh the duchess our plans still hold madame he asked mon dieu she replied do what you choose what matters france or to me duke bowed as he resumed his place his nephew a young diplomat remarked so it is the emperor s purpose that not the king of france but shall be duke of milan neither the one nor the other will be replied the ambassador other signatures were being affixed every one had written his name as a subscriber to the happiness and ascanio benvenuto walked up to the king and knelt upon before him sire said he having issued commands as king i now prefer a your majesty s humble and grateful servant will your majesty grant me one last favor say on benvenuto say on returned françois who was in a and who discovered anew that it was the prerogative of take it for all in all a king finds the most pleasure you desire to return to italy sire said benvenuto what does this mean cried the king you wish to leave me when so many masterpieces still in hand for me i ll not have it sire replied benvenuto i will return i give you my word but go let me see my country once more for i feel the need of it i do not talk of my suffering he continued lowering his shaking his head sadly but i have many causes of sorrow which not describe and nothing but the air of my native land can wounded heart you are a great and generous king to whom i am i will return sire but let me go now and be cured in sunlight of the south i leave with you ascanio my brain my hand they will suffice to carry out your artistic my return and when i have received the soft kisses of the florence my mother i will return to you my king and death part us go if you will said françois sadly it is fitting that art free as the swallows go gave benvenuto his hand which the artist kissed with all the heartfelt gratitude they withdrew benvenuto found himself by the duchess s side are you very angry with me madame said he slipping into her fatal letter which like a magic talisman had no said the duchess overjoyed to have it in her possession at last and yet you defeated me by means go to said benvenuto i threatened you with them but do you think have used them god in heaven cried the duchess as if the light had suddenly come that is what it is to have thought that you were like myself next day ascanio and colombe were married in the chapel at and notwithstanding the rules of etiquette the young permission for jacques aubry and his wife to be present was a signal favor but we must agree that the poor student had it de week later hermann solemnly espoused dame perrine who brought him marriage portion twenty thousand tours livres and the he would soon be a father hasten to say that this assurance had much more to do with the s determination than the twenty thousand tours livres the evening following the marriage of colombe and ascanio out for florence despite the entreaties of the young husband his stay in italy he cast the statue of perseus which the square of the old palace and which was his most for no other reason perhaps than that he executed
