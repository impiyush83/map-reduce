implements corn and hay turnips even apples had duly been entered to their various buyers such smaller articles as milk pails cheese tubs cream tins scales and other items of a dairy gear were passing hammer the auction had been well attended for it had been that things would go cheap and though the under which the sale took place called forth of regret and compassion they in no way lessened the to secure good bargains giles stelling had always kept pace with the times and had the first to adopt new appliances and avail himself of the advancing science throws even upon the avocations of the farmer had gone a little too fast as his neighbours now agreed with and and shakings of heads all these grand of his had helped to precipitate the catastrophe which catastrophe which was tragic indeed for the old farmer by the prospect of impending ruin had been carried off by fit even before this enforced sale of his effects though many considered these strange new and binders these unnatural looking double ploughs a kind in the face of providence a few spirited individuals had made minds to bid for them and one energetic purchaser had even miles from the other side of the county to secure complicated machine bidding was still proceeding briskly in the great barn when shouldered his way through the crowd and made a tour of the premises previous to setting forth again on his return journey was a middle sized elderly man with bright blue eyes that kindly if keenly from beneath bushy grizzled brows the ruddy face off by a fringe of white beard and whisker looked good humoured enough but the somewhat stooping shoulders bore witness constant and arduous labour which had been elias lot life sauntered across the great yard so desolate to day albeit crowded upper end nearest the barn the suspension of the ordinary life place gave it an air of supreme melancholy and even loneliness thrusting at each other in their enclosures and the sheep hurdled off in convenient lots the very fowl and squawking lamentably for the more valuable specimens were in bunches by the these dumb things seemed to have of instinctive understanding that something unusual and tragic forward beasts they do make a deal noise muttered elias half aloud body might think they was a for their master well well an ill wind what blows nobody good and that there turnip hoer was bargain it do him no harm as i should picked it cheap nay nay do him no harm where he be gone to and as well bought it as another satisfied a passing twinge of conscience with this reflection into the great rickyard and stood a moment gazing from one other of the golden and russet stacks stuff he muttered to himself be real old hay in and this here wheat a goodish lot money in much mistaken here be another half fine stuff a pity the poor old master did live to see the end if the money were a into his own pocket he been much the better for was wandering round the rick in question gazing at it from and even thrusting his hands upwards into the loosened sheaves portion which had been unroofed and partially thrashed when rustle close to him made him start perched high upon the ledge of the half demolished stack a figure knee deep among the roughly piled up sheaves the tall figure of a young girl she was dressed in black and from wide sombre brim of her straw hat a pair of blue eyes looked at the farmer the face in which they were set was oval and at that moment very pale the lips were parted showing of white teeth my dear said fiander stepping a little further away from and gazing up at her in mild whatever might up there you did me quite a start i do assure ye looking at something i like to see returned the girl in voice and her bosom heaved with a quick angry sob said the other tentatively setting his hat a little further his head and wrinkling up his eyes he examined her more closely dress the wrathful miserable face told their own tale ye be somebody to the poor old master he sobbed again for all response said fiander again with a world of sympathy in his blue eyes a melancholy sight for ye sure mr daughter corrected the girl heart alive is is very sad for ye miss but never keep a on the stack yourself so i would is a very sad business altogether miss stelling but yourself worse if ye bide here girl stepped across the sheaves and drew near the edge of the stack stretched out his hand to assist her down it he remarked encouragingly main glad to see you are and ready to take advice miss stelling here let me help thank you she replied my name is stelling and supporting herself with one hand against the edge of she swung herself gracefully down her hat dropping off as she the face thus exposed to view proved even younger than fiander and were he a more impressionable man he might well startled at its beauty though he had attained the respectable age of fifty eight and long buried a most faithful and hard working helpmate the was conscious of a glow of admiration though the blue the hair and brows were distinctly dark and the complexion brunette combination somewhat unusual and very striking was as has been said tall and slight yet with vigour as well in every movement she alighted on the ground as easily and as though she had been a bird done ejaculated fiander what might your name be if stelling name is goldring she replied a little haughtily my mother was mr daughter now returned the farmer smiling cheerfully a pretty name for a token i might say did you tell me miss i do mind a song as i used to hear when a boy about rosalie the prairie flower she had picked up her stood gazing at him discontentedly suppose everything is sold by this time she said mare and the trap and even my cocks and hens he always used to tell me that everything in the whole to

evening mr fiander reached home and after his horse and casting a cursory glance round to ascertain that gone wrong in his absence he betook himself across the fields to of his next neighbour and great crony isaac sharpe found his friend seated in the armchair by the chimney corner isaac a bachelor man paid small heed to the refinements which beginning to be in vogue among his class and habitually sat kitchen the old woman who acted as housekeeper to him had and he was alone in the wide flagged room which looked just now lit up as it was by the wood fire which danced gaily yellow walls and threw gigantic shadows of the hams and from the great oaken beams on the ceiling he was just in of shaking out the ashes from his pipe previous to retiring for when elias entered and greeted him with no small astonishment it you i were just a to lock up and go to roost creaked noisily across the great kitchen and standing in the chimney corner looked down at him for a moment the other tapped his pipe on the iron hob nearest him to gaze interrogatively at the new comer he was about age as fiander but looked younger his burly form being straight sunburnt face more lightly touched by the hand of time hair beard whiskers alike abundant were of a uniform pepper and more pepper than salt in the mixture when he smiled he displayed of teeth in no less excellent preservation elias continued to gaze down at him with an odd sheepish expression without speaking he himself took the initiative called round to tell me about the sale i suppose well i take kind of ye though i was for your after fangled machine i do give a big price for tone had a tinge of severity and it was noticeable throughout attitude towards fiander was somewhat dictatorial though in was the older as well as the richer man now nay now the latter returned quickly be wrong for once is a wonderful bargain things was oncommon cheap was hurdles to be picked up for next to i were a you isaac and a comed me yes hurdles wonderful cheap come in handy for your sheep grunted since he had not thought fit to accompany his friend rather annoyed at being told of the bargains he had missed was a long way to travel he remarked you have to go i turned off by yellowham hill about four mile out and i cut off a good bit that way a got the hoer grunted isaac you bid for i did bid for it returned elias with a sheepish chuckle a met with a wonderful piece of luck out yonder paused slowly rubbed his hands chuckled again and finally so that his face was on a level with said slowly be a hearing summat on sunday as surprise ye who from force of habit had replaced his empty pipe in his mouth took it out gaped at his interlocutor for a full half minute said be i a to hear sunday my banns announced fiander triumphant but shamefaced too ejaculated isaac in a tone of immeasurable disgust be again be ye i never did see sich a man for wedlock why this make the third of returned elias plaintively none of my

he did to pay thirteen pound for he rented of old meatyard what was master then thirteen pound of that why i used to hear him say as pounds and pounds his hands before he could count as made a penny remarked mr sharpe with the placid interest of one who hears told tale but then pastures and house rent and all were counted father paid no rent for did he and meatyard found him and kept him in hay and oil cake and that agreed elias unwillingly for the enumeration of these detracted from the picturesque aspect of the case he did that but my father he said it were a poor way a up my boy he did use to say up and buy a bit land for yourself so i scraped and laid by and my first missus she were a very thrifty body very thrifty body she were she put her shoulder to the wheel too old meatyard

stood outlined against of fire lit kitchen it was almost dusk in the parlour two men sat all in the dark here observed a cheerful voice the lamp elias my dear do this here be mr isaac sharpe our next neighbour a heard me talk on often isaac mrs fiander wedged his pipe firmly into the corner of his mouth and extended hand according to the code of manners prevalent in it was not considered necessary to rise when you greeted ye do mum i give you joy he remarked her hand was released mrs fiander sought and found lamp and removed the shade and chimney always with such movements that isaac remarked to himself approvingly that she very slack about her work she struck a match bending over and suddenly the light flared up isaac leaned forward in attitude a hand on either knee and took a good look at comer then drawing himself back and removing his pipe from he shot an indignant glance at fiander that looks more cheerful remarked the unconscious bride will be ready in a minute go and get the cloth she vanished the new made husband bent over anxiously to his friend do you think of her he remarked jerking his thumb over returned his friend wrathfully and reproachfully did it of ye no that i did at your time of life and two of nay now i did think it of you the least do was to pick out a staid woman come retorted fiander young but wear off mend in time only that she be young resumed sharpe

warm sunday too the little congregation of the ivy grown church in the hollow seemed to have found the oppressive the men were wiping their moist brows previous the hard uncompromising hats which alone could do justice to and the women fanned themselves with their clean or sniffed ostentatiously at the squat oddly of smelling salts or nosegays of jessamine and southernwood which they had provided themselves in the village proper churchgoers waited the return of their more pious brethren one lads sat expectantly on stiles on the look out for their whom they would escort homewards and with whom they make appointments for a stroll at some later hour of the day with important faces might be seen returning from carefully carrying the sunday dinner covered with a and a few older men and women stood about their doorsteps over their garden gates with the intention of waylaying bound neighbours and extracting from them items concerning important event which had recently taken place in the vicinity very fat old lady propping herself with difficulty against of her door hailed her opposite neighbour eagerly day mrs paddock did ye chance to notice if master have a yet he have a come

mind to leave his money behind him for a woman to spend on be it find mrs keep her money as she keep her be master now announced her opposite neighbour craning her little further out of the doorway poor man he do look upset eyes of all the little party fixed themselves on the mr sharpe was clad in sunday gear of prosperous broadcloth somewhat on the back of his head a tall hat so antiquated as and so shaggy as to texture that the material of which it may possibly have been beaver his large face was at absolutely devoid of all expression mrs remark seemed to be dictated by a somewhat lively imagination absently as the women greeted him which they did as both their husbands worked under him but wheeled he had passed the group to address mrs paddock take those chicken off you as you was a on if up to my place to week the fox have a took a lot of mine and i to disappoint my customers fetch up sir so soon as i can these be terrible times mr they sich losses as a had last week the fox a

the farmer again his large face seemed just as before but a close observer might have detected suffusion of colour to the eyelids say as mrs fiander be on terrible put in mrs belbin her arms across her ample bosom and settling herself for a with an air of melancholy enjoyment is a nice that and the marriage did turn out wonderful well folks did think it a bit foolish mr fiander to choose sich maid at his time life but he was lonesome poor man first wife so long ago and the children dying so young and missus took too but well as i say the last out wonderful well there was never a word said mrs was never a word to be said returned mr sharpe just what i say chimed in mrs paddock was she be a nice body mrs fiander be agreed the farmer she be a nice plain young woman have a proved that he did think his a good for left her everything as he had in the world not if she marries again sir sure cried both the women together added mrs belbin never been sich a sammy as to keep everything if she goes for to take another man be left house and farm stock and money onconditional sharpe emphatically and he passed on leaving the gossips aghast the time lost in wooing in watching and the light that in eyes has been my undoing thomas moore subject of the conversation recently recorded was slowly removing and laying them carefully away on the lavender scented the desolate upper chamber of the home which had suddenly grown divested of the flowing mantle the tall well moulded set off by its close fitting black robe and the face which had from view by the thick folds of crape proved able to stand of the glaring summer sunshine the adjective applied widow by her late friend must be taken only in its as signifying and straightforward even to the of this elderly yeoman beauty had ripened and the four years that had elapsed since her marriage with the black lashes which shaded her lovely eyes were still wet red lips quivered and the bosom heaved convulsively most of and neighbours of the late mr fiander would have to say the sight of such grief it decent and becoming to cry in church where everybody was looking but to cry when you were alone for an old man of sixty been left in undisputed possession of all his property and perfect impunity marry again at the earliest possible not only unreasonable and foolish but rank ingratitude for the dispensation of providence mrs fiander continued to sob to herself and to look blankly empty room and out at the wide fields where the familiar figure wont to roam and when taking the new cap from its box it on the top of her abundant hair she could not repress gush of tears fiander she said to herself would let me wear it if it makes me a perfect fright and is so cumbersome and so much way but wear it all the same nobody shall say wanting to his memory dear dear not a week gone yet it seems a year descended the stairs slowly and entered the parlour there was backed chair where fiander used to sit waiting for the sunday there also was the stool on which he supported his gouty leg was another chair invariably occupied by farmer sharpe afternoons when after a walk round his land he for a chat and a smoke mrs fiander herself had always sat at joining in the conversation from time to time after she had her husband and his friend the stiff glass of grog of which it custom to partake fiander said nobody mixed it so well as she even mr sharpe occasionally nodded approval and generously she was a first rate hand wondered idly if mr sharpe would come to day she almost hoped she did not like to walk round the fields it strange it was so lonely and so dreary sitting in the house mr chair remained empty all that afternoon mrs fiander had other visitors it was getting near tea time and she forward somewhat anxiously to the arrival of that meal make a break in the dismal hours when a genteel knock at the her she knew it was not isaac for it was his custom to uninvited and thought it might be some other neighbour coming with of comfort she was surprised however when the maid ushered in stout young man whom she recognised as the son of one of tradespeople in the town andrew father was indeed cab and coach proprietor on a large scale but also undertaker now remembered that her actual visitor had taken a prominent her funeral jest called to see how you might be getting on mrs fiander to offer my respectful condoliences was a where we met last mrs fiander was indeed said rosalie adding somewhat stiffly a seat burge burge took a one of the ordinary chairs which mrs with a general wave of the hand but poor one which was as has been stated established in corner it happened to be directly opposite to the one in had been usual was no by the visitor on account of its agreeable proximity to anybody more unlike its former occupant it would be hard andrew was as has been said tall and stout with black eyes resembling boot buttons in size and expression a and very sleek black hair he conveyed a general bursting out of his clothes his coat appearing to be too tight too short his collar too high and his hat when he wore it small this hat he carefully placed upon the ground between and drew from its crown a large white pocket handkerchief which almost in a professional manner feels he went on attuning his voice to the melancholy tone with this feels that any condoliences let them sincere as they may falls immaterially short of the occasion mr elias fiander was universally respected by the townsfolk as well as by his own immediate neighbours are very kind said rosalie feeling that she must make a remark inwardly chiding herself for the frenzied impatience with which longed to turn him out of her chair after all the man was unconscious of offence and meant well was i may say mrs fiander a object of congratulation to me that able to pay the deceased a last melancholy tribute you chance to observe that it was me druv the knew i had seen you there said the widow in a low voice for the moment recollect where would fallen in better my own wishes went on andrew driven both you but my father told me you did notion the jubilee mean that combined hearse and mourning coach cried rosalie why the coffin is put crosswise behind the legs a bale of goods i think dreadful now returned andrew are most careful to show every respect pore corpse the compartment is made and all some people thinks it a privilege for the mourners to behind so close to their dear departed and then think of it one pair of horses needed you know not but is no object to you and of course your you felt i suppose it would be almost too know i could bear the idea she cried jubilee hearse call it how came you to give it such a name why you see it was entirely my idea and he had it the jubilee year he thought you know like to do something special that year by way of his loyalty ah he spared in of it out i do assure well as i was fiander it would have been a great pleasure to me to have given a token of respect and sympathy at the same time but since it to be i followed what i thought would be most in accordance wishes and i showed my respect for your by driving he flourished the handkerchief again and raised the boot button mrs face am of course grateful for any tribute of respect to my she said resumed mr burge thought look on it in that light should have thought it a privilege to drive you mrs fiander made some inarticulate rejoinder thought just call round and explain my motives he went on take the opportunity of offering in person my best condoliences you said rosalie may speak i think remarked andrew pompously the name of borough of branston there was i might say but one when the noos of his death came to town but one mournful murmur do assure mrs fiander looked up gratefully the young man certainly meant well and was gratifying she felt a little thrill of at the thought of the universal esteem and respect in which elias had been held but meeting the hard expressionless gaze tight little eyes the appreciative compliment died upon now resumed the visitor diving for his hat and carefully the handkerchief in its mrs fiander having spoken and for my fellow townsmen and having assured myself that you worse in health than might have been expected under these i will withdraw rose ducked his head extended his hand and solemnly up and down for about two minutes finally backing to the door he let himself out he almost fell over another caller who was at raising his hand to the knocker this was a dapper gentleman his own age with an alert and sprightly air and a good humoured featured face just standing within the half open parlour door caught sight new comer and wondered who he might be in a moment he had set at rest day he remarked advancing cheerily with must introduce myself i see not so well known to you are to me my name is i am one of mr clerks robinson and bradbury solicitors you i am i just called round make a few remarks with regard business matters in the hands of our firm you sit down said rosalie hastily taking possession of chair it should not if she could help it again that day she pointed out a small one but mr samuel cross noticing the intimation stepped quickly forward and opposite to the widow in the chair she had just chair rosalie contemplated him with knitted brows since mr that trusted friend had not thought fit to occupy his himself that afternoon she felt ill pleased at the intrusion presumptuous stranger a callow little shrimp of a man it was to be sure and how unlike his spare form and small narrow face which she to that of a the large bland personality of isaac matter of business she said drily am surprised that mr should send you on sunday this is quite an informal visit mrs fiander not at all official came of my own may say in my private capacity this here a six and eightpenny affair he he said rosalie even more drily than before seeing mrs fiander that you are left so peculiarly lonely i just thought to myself that it would be only kind to call passing and mention that your business matters mrs fiander are in satisfactory position i have frequently heard our firm remark seldom had to deal with affairs more satisfactory husband had a very clear head for business said mrs fiander found that is that alone rejoined the young man is if i may to express an opinion the very satisfactory manner in which disposed of his property on which i feel bound to congratulate you called round private as i say jist to let you know as all was you i had no doubt about it said rosalie surveying with increasing disfavour as he leered at her from the depth capacious chair he pursued with an ingratiating is apt to alarmed when legal matters is under discussion the very come so natural to us are apt to frighten them bless you say when mr robinson do talk about testamentary dispositions like it makes you feel quite nervous but is only the sound words as is strange the thing itself meaning the of the late lamented mr fiander is i do assure you what with the freehold property the farm and invested in such good and safe may be sure that good and safe mrs fiander for i may to tell you that the late lamented used to consult our firm with regard have pleasure in assuring you that very few ladies in so satisfactory a position as you do find yourself to day jist dropped in unofficial like to let you know this for as i myself it may be a satisfaction to pore mrs fiander to know her and to understand that desolate as she may be left some compensations and that moreover she has been left and independent the late lamented not having hampered her by whatever mr cross who had been leaning forward in his chair so that with its narrow jaws and its little twinkling eyes had been a below the level of the slightly disdainful countenance of now slowly straightened himself clapped an exultant hand knee and brought the jaws aforesaid together with a snap fiander could not help contrasting him once more with the friend by right be sitting opposite to her how far more welcome been the sight of the good tempered rubicund visage the form even the contented amicable taciturnity which mr maintained during the greater part of his visits would have more to her mind than this loquacity which somehow near familiarity still it was unreasonable to take to the poor young man merely because he looked like a weasel disposed to be a little over friendly no doubt his intention thanked him therefore with somewhat forced politeness but repress a little forward movement in her chair which a would have recognized as a token of dismissal mr cross was not of this calibre and prolonged his visit until his fairly wore out she rose at last glancing at the clock that she thought it was time to get ready for evening church will have the pleasure of escorting you announced samuel cheerfully mrs fiander sat down again second thoughts too tired she said i will not allow delay any longer mr will certainly be late as it is had no course but to withdraw then which he did unwillingly enough tenderly pressing the hand and assuring her that she might depend on him to look after her every way in his power was disconsolately polishing the hand which had received token of interest when the door creaked slowly open and gaunt elderly female clad in rusty black and wearing somewhat back of her head a flat black bonnet with the strings untied the room this was mrs greene a personage generally to be in this neighbourhood in households whose number had recently increased or diminished she was equally at home as she with babies and with corpses and she filled up the her appearance was so genteel and her manner her various duties so elegant that the once remarked that she was wonderfully refined for a char woman had stuck to her and she was commonly known as the among such of the as occasionally employed her capacity had come to littlecomb farm to poor elias fiander and remaining on as chief factotum and comforter for it was to that the poor young widow be to after less to turn her thoughts to for herself she slowly to the table and after heaving a deep sigh proceeded the cloth rosalie knew that she was burning to enter but was too much dispirited to encourage her and by after a preliminary cough mrs greene remarked in tone a lovely cap mum everybody was a that you did in your weeds ay that was what they said do was the very thing they said is a comfort too see how nice she do mourn for mr fiander they was passing the remark one to the other about it they was cried rosalie wrathfully but with a little quaver in would be very strange i think if i did not grieve for such husband i wish people would talk about me she ejaculated mrs greene dismally they will talk mum depend on it talk and perticlarly about a lord how they did go on about me when poor greene died leave so much as my alone whether i could afford it or whether be for ridden house and into put the children in an orphanage and get married to drive a body silly the way they did go on cried rosalie now faintly interested idea of a second marriage when your poor husband was only just dead that be the first thing talk on with a kind of perticlar if a woman be young and good in case mum i do assure ye they be all a out your second what they be a but as they all picks different men so very well agree greene ejaculated her mistress indignantly wheeling round in do you mean how dare you come and repeat such things positively indecent be the very remark as i did pass myself to the men yesterday mrs greene pausing to contemplate mrs fiander with her her hips very thing is most says i yourselves up to pry into the affairs your betters missus i a of nothing but her so far and when make her says i please herself and pick out him most suitable them was my words mum cried rosalie rising to her feet impetuously wonder you own them to me mrs greene i think that considering you are yourself you ought to know better than to accuse another woman faithlessness if you think i could ever ever forget my good you are much mistaken greene coughed drily behind her hand should i marry again any more than you cried rosalie with starting to her eyes mum the cases be very different nobody never axed was likely as they should considering i had six children and only labour to keep as for you mum nobody could think it strange if you was to get married everything your station in life continued mrs greene delicately blessed with no children and your and your oncommon be very strange if there was a many a coming you may depend upon it they will she cried with conviction how young you be mum and how lonesome like i should say your dooty to take a second listen to me mrs greene said rosalie very emphatically put an end to this foolish gossip at once you can tell you hear talking about the matter that i never intend to never you hear me mum returned mrs greene with every feature and line of expressing disbelief hear i better begin them two chaps know what called here to day i do wish you would talk such nonsense mrs greene cried pettishly though the colour rushed over her face and a showed itself for a moment in her heavy eyes away want to be worried any more remember what i have said nothing coming nothing landrail craking one cock crowing few things moving up and down all things drowsy north country song passed a very unquiet night and woke from a troubled after dawn the dead weight of grief ever present to her bereavement was now as she dimly felt supplemented by irritating something unpleasant as her returned to her she gradually recognised that this state was produced by several small causes the two visits which received yesterday and which she had supposed to proceed from goodwill had as she now acknowledged been prompted in by aspirations as unjustifiable as they were unseemly interview with mrs greene had disagreeably enlightened her point and had also made her aware of the kind of gossip to must expect to be subjected through that long lonely day isaac sharpe had not once put in an appearance he faithful friend the only real friend whom she had not thought fit to look in for so much as five cheer her in her desolation as she thought of these things hot afresh to her eyes oh how desolate she was no one for her and what was almost worse no one seemed to believe sincerity of her affliction she lay tossing uneasily on her pillow and as the light grew and the jubilant songs mingled with the distant cows a new sense of disquietude came to her proceeding from and very tangible cause it was broad of exceptional importance at the no human being to be afoot reaching up her hand to the old fashioned watch hung in the centre of the bed she took down heavy and pressed the spring ting ting ting ting ting sitting up she sent the two cases flying open and incredulously at the dial beneath ten minutes past less sprang out of bed and flung open her door susan what are you about is past five and how did you come to oversleep yourselves like that was a muffled murmur a thud upon the floor a pat pat of across the room above and a door overhead opened ye mum i calling i should think i was calling have you forgotten it is missus that i lord no was this day master was buried dear yes so was lump rose in throat but she steadied her voice and am not talking of that it is churning morning as you know you should have been up and about an hour ago make as much you can now and come down closed the door with just sufficient noise to indicate the her feelings and hastened across the room to the open window the curtains apart she looked out a glorious day a cloud upon the pearly blue expanse of sky the leaves in a fresh breeze laden with all the exquisite of morning the fragrance of dewy grasses of sun kissed trees awakened flowers the monthly rose tree climbing round window thrust its delicate clusters of bloom almost face but she pushed it impatiently aside her eyes cast glance on the homely scene beyond above the time worn roofs of buildings where the green of the moss and the mellow red and the tiles were alike transfigured by this mystic glow she could ricks shouldering each other their regular outlines defined it were with a pencil of fire the great meadow beyond which till it reached the church yard wall a quarter of a mile away into light ripples tawny and russet as the breeze swept over it these were sights to gladden a young a heart that the expression of eyes grew more and and displeased and a frown gathered on her brow fowl were flocking impatiently about the gate of the great barn yard on the further side from beneath the tiled roof of the line she could hear loud vociferations turning her eyes towards buildings which ran at right angles to them she could see doors were fast closed and could hear the rattling of chains of heavy hoofs within the church meadow ought to have been grass was over ripe as it was men and horses should have work since three no figures appeared even in of the barn and looking beyond to the barton proper see that it was empty no wonder that the lowing of the cows distant in her ears they were still in their pasture by poor creatures crowding round the gate no doubt as the doing close at hand all clamouring alike for the attention evidently withheld from them what was everyone about why had men come to their work as usual performed her toilet hastily and somewhat perfunctorily and when a sleepy looking red haired man came slouching up the lane which the farm he was surprised to see a figure in rustling print brimmed chip hat standing in the midst of a bevy of cocks and hens handfuls of grain with wide impetuous sweeps of a round arm the hurry sukey he inquired pleasantly the face which was flashed upon him was not the rosy and one of susan but belonged to no less a person than the hurry job she repeated severely should like to there is a little more hurry what has become of all the men anybody gone to fetch the cows what is everyone about i say tilted his hat a little sideways on his red locks the better his head and gazed at his mistress with a puzzled and expression must expect things to be a bit for a bit mum the loss had and us all so upset poor master we a got the to go about our work as had happened it to be looked for nay now mildly we did look to find yerself a about did sure it scarce seems if i may make so to say so it do job fixed an expostulatory glance on young face that was confronting seem scarce right mum hunt returned his mistress haughtily are not called upon remarks upon my actions but i will tell you so much it is my see that the work in this place is properly done and i intend that be properly done go and call the other men at once tell them are ever again so disgracefully late they shall all be fined quickly she added with an imperative tap of the foot then fetch the cows she turned to re enter the house she caught sight of susan who exchanging astonished and depreciatory grimaces with job greene in the background was raising hands and eyes to heaven get to work she cried sharply the cream susan and you get the churn ready well mrs greene what are you staring at you never seen me work before that the fact of my turning up need astonish you so much i suppose you can find something about the house give me that other skimmer jane dear yes mum i can find a plenty to do about this here house but a at you mum because it do really seem too flesh blood to be a on itself as you be a now mum dear yes but to be hoped as ye constitootion mrs fiander and clean the kitchen grate said rosalie beginning to skim rapidity and decision see that you blacklead it properly yes mum blacklead it returned the elder matron without attempting to move from the spot where she stood and fix her eyes mournfully on her blacklead it she repeated with a kind of groan after a pause during had meditatively polished first one skinny bare arm and then with a not over clean apron why in name you go then cried for she felt mrs sorrowfully disapproving at the back of her head be going mum i be going if i mid take the liberty of is your hat as a got on your head inquired rosalie reddening ominously mrs fiander returned the char woman with an insinuating smile you like me to run upstairs it now and fetch you down replied her mistress very shortly i had wished for it i sent for it you need not be so officious the strings would my way while i worked she added a little inconsequently she was lowering herself by making this explanation yet she could that even mrs greene and the two maids should think her wanting to memory greene withdrew murmuring under her breath that it was to be nobody would chance look in that morning which was not very likely the hands of the old fashioned clock in the just pointing to the quarter past six some minutes nothing was heard but the clinking of the the sides of the vats as the rich cream clotted and crinkled was removed therefrom the scene was a pretty one indeed such on such a morning must always hold a charm and of its own and now that the angular presence of mrs was removed there was absolutely no discordant element in harmony the dairy itself was a wide pleasant room its buff red flagged floor throwing out the exquisite tints of the vast cream each marked off by its own barrier of glancing tin and tone from the deep yellow of that portion destined for the to the warm white of the foaming pailfuls which job poured to time somewhat sulkily into the vat nearest the door then the green of the gently swaying boughs without seen through open door the brilliant patch of sunlight creeping over the the glint of blue sky between sunlit green and sunlit stone brave array of glittering cans on the topmost shelf added their of brightness the great earthenware crocks and pans some the of the cream itself some ruddy in tone some of a deep lent also valuable aid then there were tall white jars carefully packed baskets and smooth wooden vessels piled high little squares of filmy gauze hung out on lines in readiness golden rolls of butter which they were soon to enfold the the girls the mistress of littlecomb farm was no a girl in the necessary and very delightful touch interest susan and jane in cotton dresses and large aprons that the mere sight of them was sufficient to recall that the first day of the week were not without a certain rustic charm own as for rosalie standing in the foreground with her up on her white arms her print dress fitting so closely to form the hair hastily rolled up escaping into such and tendrils round brow and ear and shapely was what her admiring old elias had once called leading article the churn was fairly at work the skim milk duly meted out to and the long procession of dairy cows were sauntering back to under the guardianship of job and the three who had been busily milking rosalie removed her hat and sat down flush of annoyance still lingered on her face and while she ate glance wandered through the window to the premises without hear robert cross and james bundy leisurely leading out the horses them with many objurgations to stand while they were to the rattling creaking mower how slow they were have been in the field hours ago and yet they slouched about the beautiful golden morning were not already half over now they were here was james coming back for something forgotten rising hastily from her chair she leaned out of the tapping impatiently on the pane are you about bundy on earth you try and make a little more haste gasped bundy turning round a vacant weather beaten with the smallest fraction of a nose which it was possible face of man to possess say why you make more haste when you have lost so much be making so much haste as ever i can responded james be just a to fetch the ile can would be to get to work without the ile can did you think about the oil can while cross was harnessing is nearly eight have lost half your looked up at the sky then still in an aggrieved manner at was all so upset he was beginning when she interrupted let me hear another word about your being upset if i can my business you can attend to yours i should think is but for disgraceful laziness was upset asserted bundy with much dignity as for if it comes to that we can keep on a bit later must certainly work later this afternoon but how long will weather last think you besides you know as well as i do that much better for the horses to work in the early morning there now and try to make up for lost time returned to her breakfast and james rejoined his companion at accelerated pace but by and by her attention was caught sound of voices apparently in placid conversation back to again flew she the village carpenter who was supposed to the yard gate had just arrived and was leaning one of the posts while abel hunt brother a large pig food in either hand was leisurely talking to him will give them a few minutes said rosalie to herself all be too hard on them more she went back to the table finished her egg and drank cup of tea the trickle of talk meanwhile continuing back her chair she returned to the window impatiently had remained in the same attitude without even unfastening of tools abel had set down his pails and propped himself up other gate post the pigs were wildly protesting in the background recrossed the room hastily and went to the door you intend to gossip here all day she inquired with flashing eyes was jest a about the melancolly event explained will oblige me said rosalie keeping to your work abel pails across to the sties at once remember i will have no took up his pails and the carpenter unfastened his tools of both faces alike shocked wounded and astonished this goes on murmured rosalie to herself shall not only heart but go out of my mind oh elias you were clever as well seemed to go by clock work when you were why leave me days oh he do such a funny hat mid a brim all a strout his hair his glissenèn eyes down a coat broad skirts that do in the wind ov his walk round his knee william barnes the forenoon was passed in butter making and in the betook herself to the mead to superintend the operations of robert it was not until after tea that she had leisure to dress and make her way by the well known little footpath the cornfields and wound across the downs to isaac found that worthy standing contemplatively in the middle of his yard had been sheep shearing that day and the master had worked as any of the men now however the naked ungainly looking ewes to their pasture the newly taken fleeces lay neatly piled up corner of the barn and isaac was at liberty to straighten his relax his muscles and smoke the pipe of peace massive and imposing was this figure of his ever at its best smock frock and serviceable corduroys and leggings of weekday wear wideawake turned up at the back and projecting in front in shovel form was decidedly more becoming than the sunday beaver started as the yard gate creaked upon its hinges and robed figure passed through mrs fiander he cried hastening towards her this you to see ye is there anything i can do for could hardly have defined the motive which prompted her visit desolate heart felt the need of sympathy in this strange new life she yearned to find herself once more if but for a moment in the past mr sharpe she said with a little gasp anything you can do for me i only came because sharpe everything is going wrong sharpe took out his pipe and opened his eyes very wide he said me what be the matter the matter returned the widow in a shaking voice i get on without elias now my dear returned isaac blinking very hard is gave a little sob and the farmer stretching out a large patted her arm soothingly take on though he said now take on never did nobody no good so lonely went on the girl brokenly miss him at every turn be like to do that responded sharpe judicially like to do that is at sixes and sevens she pursued plaintively they can do just as they like it was eight before their mowing this morning i never ejaculated isaac what be the to very maids get up continued rosalie was and it was after five before anybody moved none of the near the place until six the cows were left in the pasture none beasts were fed commented the farmer heart alive i sich i speak to them cried rosalie her voice rising with of her wrongs turn round and tell me they are all upset to think of work they now in tones of deep disgust a and you know mr sharpe is the last thing elias would the work should be neglected and everything allowed to like this yet they seem to think me heartless for expecting go on as before and the worst of it all poor rosalie weep any of them believe that i am sorry and they think going to marry again and hateful impudent young men have already come to court me sobs well nigh choked her as she made this last announcement full of concern fell to patting her arm again now my dear well is very for sure there cry so well well to think have they well they mid waited a bit but a minute do mrs fiander and sit down dear heart alive heart alive poor elias be terrible upset if he were to see way like this half persuaded half propelled the still weeping widow across the into his kitchen where sitting down near the table and covering with her hands under the heavy crape veil she continued to her host was nearly distracted my dear take a sup this will do ye good threw back her veil and took the glass which he offered her it to her lips she found that the dark decoction which was excessively strong unusually acid and unspeakably nasty tears not prompted by sorrow this time started to her eyes as down the glass you mr sharpe she said am better now i think it it seems very strong that agreed the farmer with some pride wine bithey it she do make a quart every year wonderful good for the spasms sich like she do get taken that way sometimes in her soul she says a drop this do set her to rights ah what it be called scarce think made but the snags what grows in the snags a trifle but i do assure ye is that strong will sometimes lift out the bottle now mrs fiander best finish it is to let the good stuff go to waste as rosalie gratefully but firmly declined the worthy man thrifty conscience by draining the glass himself now mrs fiander he resumed as he set it down be that ye be so vexed the men so late but may advise be a bit stiff let fancy impose upon because ye be a woman assure you mr sharpe i showed them very plainly that i was morning i spoke as severely as i could my dear them chaps care for words more words bless you all got women folks their own be well used to is different us men when we we can dang here and there and use a bit language then see said isaac leaning forward confidentially as we be in earnest but be no manner good to do that my dear would come to and think a bit the better of for it nay nay he think the better of faint smile hovered round lips but isaac remained woman must show by her deeds that she be in earnest he went on pause is the only way my dear deeds and not words for he paused again shaking his head reflectively it was his thoughts had travelled back to that memorable box in which father had enshrined the riven locks that testified to his and the vigorous retaliation of his wife had certainly been a woman of action it my dear repeated sharpe emerging from his reverie forced to turn to deeds next time them chaps comes late jist you fine them says you work desarves short pay bear in mind you to the work shall be the wage i might try that agreed rosalie the worst of it is so much time and do their work so badly when they do come jist make example one your best plan worst them the sack and find the others settle lambs said the sheep farmer bringing out the you very much for your advice mr sharpe take it she paused a moment would you recommend me to regard to my other difficulty how am i to make people i mean to marry again a body really think they need be so be downright ondacent for to be a about have no business to think of it at all mr sharpe widow fiercely shall never never put anyone in my place very well said my dear returned isaac looking at her kindness and emotion is the proper spirit i myself as have heard me say was never one to set up for wedlock well a husband and a good you be in the right to that just as i be satisfied no wife at all heart alive when i were a young chap the maids did use to their eyes at me but i never took no notice and when i staid there was one very woman i do she were ah she come to house here time and again excuse or another and at last so soon as i did see her i to shut door in her face what i shall do cried rosalie laughing and clapping the very thing i shall do thank you for the hint mr that again you see will be deeds not words looked kindly at the bright face and sparkling eyes and be the way to take only wish i had thought of it on sunday she went on two and talked so long that i was wishing them anywhere i expected sunday mr sharpe she added in an altered voice while the from her face said isaac abashed and guilty i did thought you would have come if only in memory times to tell the trewth i could a bear to go nigh the place out the farmer been a to littlecomb after sunday for nigh upon five and twenty year i know could expect me mrs fiander to go there now as he be gone wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his smock frock and at this memory his widow forgave the gruffness of tone but not quite the slight to herself gazed at him for a moment in silence with a quivering lip and his eyes again and heaved a sigh do not think of me at all said rosalie at last my loneliness or what i feel when i sit there looking at empty chairs and thinking of how i used to sit between you and we used to be is it worse for me to see his empty place you might have if it did hurt might have come me a word of comfort i think you were very unkind mr sharpe now my dear stammered isaac almost purple in the face his usually keen eyes suffused with tears do really to the when you look at me so pitiful and say such things knows be main glad to comfort you but what can the likes of could let me feel that i had still a friend sobbed rosalie come and sit in your old chair and we could talk trew so we could agreed isaac in a choked voice i live so not let nothing hinder me come i i should thought of you yesterday but i could to think nothing but how war there i shall be very glad to see you said rosalie rising beginning to pull down her veil i am very grateful kindness perhaps she added hesitatingly might be able in one day during the week returned the farmer mrs fiander not before sunday i busy to be ye see and the big mead cut before sunday very well she responded a little stiffly and she went out of and across the yard without speaking again except to say good the gate downs were now all bathed with the light of the sinking sun and branches of the hedges which bordered the cornfields to gold while the banks beneath had begun already to assume tint that spoke of gathering that the morning light to a very sheet of silver but rosalie could only see the the world without through a mist of crape and tears have not a friend in the world she said to herself one even take the trouble to walk a quarter of a mile to see how getting on after following his advice he is only coming on a sort of duty not because he wants to well never mind i him and everyone that i can look after myself i want pity since nobody really cares she held up her head beneath its heavy veil and went on her way stately carriage and a firm step he hizzelf about any uptied calf out sich dreats his vist up sich a size william barnes the next morning when the men came slowly sauntering to their were surprised to see mrs fiander clad this time not in but in ceremonious black standing by her own door with a of countenance she held a note book in her hand and as she jotted down some memorandum therein when the last appeared upon the scene she summoned the entire band before her she said speaking calmly and very distinctly you seem no attention to what i say i must show you that i am not to with i shall fine every one of you this morning for being late shall continue to fine you each morning that you are late and i from your pay a certain amount for every hour that you in fact for the future your wage shall be in exact proportion work you do men stared gaped and looked sullenly first at one another and their mistress you understand she inquired sharply hunt his red bearded face even more glowing than usual answered tones for himself and comrades missus us say as we do then make it clear to you rang out the brisk young voice are paid for the work you do during certain hours and if you here punctually or if you waste any of those hours i shall your weekly wage the value of the lost pay you for work you do now responded job rolling his head from side to side a bullying air hold these here want no new rules do us mates that we came the answer in a chorus of growls you want them or not i mean to keep to them returned rosalie will do you can all go to work now turned and went into the house her heart was beating very fast was rather white about the lips but she had borne herself bravely no one would have guessed the difficulty she had found in to take this stand could hear the voices murmuring together discontentedly and by the sound of heavy slouching steps moving away in warned her that the group had dispersed being the morning for cheese making she presently went upstairs her imposing black robe for her working dress and chancing came downstairs to look out of the window she observed that job standing arms a kimbo by the pigsties in close conversation brother now job should at that moment have been far on his way pasture abel ought to have been feeding the pigs this was not words said rosalie to herself think i am must show them i am in earnest went across the yard note book in hand is now half past five she remarked job are two hours and late you abel an hour i have made a note of the time if i find that you continue to disobey me i shall not keep my service made an indescribable sound between a snort and a groan and away abel however continued to stare darkly at his mistress changing his position rosalie now thoroughly incensed was about to pour out upon him of her wrath she suddenly fact being upon the pigsties near which she stood were in a condition she said were these sties cleaned out not i am sure busy saturday returned abel in sepulchral tones were you more busy last saturday than on any other saturday shuffled from one foot to the other and repeated sulkily that been mortal busy must clean them as soon as ever you have fed the pigs said is enough to bring fever to the place to have them in is responded abel roughly not attempt to answer me back like that she cried must bad for the poor animals themselves get to work without a is the day growled the man if i clean saturday what you are about said his mistress sternly uplifting a finger will not put up with impertinence or disobedience is the day shouted abel and the shuffling movement became and rapid that he actually seemed to dance will never do said rosalie see i must make a change at once hunt i give you notice to leave on saturday week change be enough for me widow fiander retorted abel voice as though his mistress stood a hundred yards away from of barely two lips quivered is your own fault she cried passionately you behave in i must make an example of you unless you do as i tell you you danged if i do clean the pigs out afore saturday shrieked abel he threw his hat upon the ground waved his arms and stamped a maniac want no danged women folk to come a and here abel relieved his feelings by what isaac sharpe call bit language your pigs yourself widow fiander one change be enough for me me so much as ever ye like not clean them pigs out came a little more and so on da capo had such an experience fallen to lot before neither old grandfather nor her doting husband had ever given her a while they lived her subordinates had invariably obeyed her alacrity and treated her personally with respect the sound strident tones the sight of his inflamed face above all he used and the insolence of his manner positively frightened her turned pale making a valiant effort to stand threw out her hand as though to command silence but as to dance and rave sheer physical terror overcame her and turned and fled her heart thumping violently against her ribs very far off during these first days of to her eyes rushed upstairs to her room and flung herself across the bed face in the pillow in an agony of humiliation a fool i am what a miserable fool to be afraid of that how can i ever hope to rule these people if i show the at the outset now of course they will think that to bully me and i shall at once give in oh fool fool to to silly womanish fears at such a moment oh oh how shall i them in the face continued to roll her head on the pillow for some moments her now become burning and her heart still beat fast no longer but with anger by and by she sat up pushed back her hair out the folds of her dress all is never too late to mend she said to herself went downstairs and into the dairy directing her maids and setting about her own work with flushed cheeks and a in course of time her agitation subsided and after her she was quite herself again noon as she passed through the kitchen to the parlour she chanced through the open door and observed that the men had in the yard and were eagerly talking instead of making homewards or retiring to the barn to eat their dinners she pay no attention to them however and walked on to her own quarters she became aware that the whole body was advancing towards and a moment later susan thrust in her round face at the door mum the men be to speak a few words with well said rosalie will go out to them reaching the threshold of the outer door she paused looking round group and waiting for them to take the initiative job was the first to speak be come to tell mrs fiander as i wish to notice ye for these here changes to my and the mistress so please to suit yourself by that time mum spoke gruffly and eyed her impertinently but this time she did well job she said have no doubt i shall be able to do any difficulty was the next to advance but rosalie waved him aside it has already been settled that you are to leave she remarked can have nothing to say to me step back now who comes next bundy it seemed came next he approached a little hesitatingly hard at his mistress mum i wish to leave on saturday week right returned rosalie with great unconcern bundy stepped back and robert cross stepped forward sure mum it do go agen me terrible to make sich a break as but still ye see we nohow put up need not take the trouble to wish to leave on with the others i suppose will do said rosalie sam belbin you wish to leave too belbin made a step forward and glanced round appealingly this time his companions were looking very blank the sudden which they had expected to frighten their mistress into apparently failed their respective attitudes had changed she and unmoved and they were beginning to be seriously uneasy and regular pay were not to be picked up every day in that part world sam said rosalie kindly as though to help him out was the chief of the three chaps a good looking young about four and twenty with a dark good humoured countenance and jaunty air as he now advanced a smile flashed suddenly over his white teeth gleaming out pleasantly he said smiled too sam what have you got to say the usual thing i suppose at all mum to say as i got no fault at all mum come in better time to morrow morn to speak to me agen mum very good said rosalie in a different tone at this a lump came in her throat but she choked it down the others got anything to say she inquired if so they will make haste and say it my dinner will be getting cold men who had not hitherto spoken looked at each other uncertainly glances finally resting on the beaming countenance of sam belbin all had he not chosen the better part do agree with he said one under his breath and then another and by all remarked aloud somewhat falteringly that they they would

he was supposed to appear the maids betimes and the business of the day progressed with far greater usual dinner time she again observed a group of men in the yard smaller however than on the preceding day and talking with and hesitating tones susan came presently to announce that some of the men wished to speak to her went out and discovered a detachment of four awaiting her plaintive wobegone faces the others in a state of stammered james bundy be a and these here come to and to say as we hopes ye bear no malice overlook what has passed undertake to give this time is a pity you

him relentlessly mind what mr sharpe said i have quite made up my mind as i shall do was thoroughly in earnest and the men knew it they fell and their young mistress returned to the house carrying very high and setting her face sternly her work was over that afternoon she set out with a business on what seemed to be a tour of inspection first walking the rows of pigsties the condition of which had on the day rise to so much controversy all was now as it should be abel and one or two of the other subordinates having devoted to them at early dawn here were pigs of every age and degree the venerable matron to the spry young porker just beginning himself to the serious business of growing fat two in all and most of them doomed to destruction within a that was the part of the economy of farming which rosalie it was the blot on the otherwise poetical and but she had hitherto been taught to consider the presence pigs an absolute necessity was this really the case might with her wit devise some better expedient by means of obnoxious animals could be dispensed with and at the same time skim milk and whey avoided the yard she betook herself to the orchard where a few families were taking exercise their presence somewhat the picturesque appearance of the place which though the blossom had long since fallen had still a considerable share of its own the sunlight beating down now through the leafage brought out wonderful silvery lights from the and outlined the curiously gnarled branches it struck out path across the lush grass for rosalie to walk on and she down the glade with bent head and serious face when she reached the end to retrace her steps she saw known sturdy form approaching her and advanced to meet still with a certain queenly air and without quickening countenance on the contrary wore a perturbed and his brow was anxiously furrowed and he gazed hard at mrs as he hastened towards her a feared had a deal trouble here he began i followed your advice you see it did altogether answer said the farmer with a yes it answered very well i think the men know in two hunts come round to my place at dinner time they were in poor chaps but do them good all the same i think off if i was you mrs fiander job be a roughish sort chap he be a good cowman abel he be wonderful with the management not going to let them off said rosalie her face hardening she thought of maniacal dance and of the loud voice which her and of insolent manner when he had said to my but be a bit to find as good isaac objected not better yourself i doubt will be harder for you on strange men am not going to put strange men in their place i am not going any more men going to have women i can manage women my dear cried isaac opening his eyes very wide and speaking stricken tones do work but they can do work i have thought it all out mr and my mind is made up job and abel must go i shall put in place he have behaved well to conceded isaac unwillingly young i doubt if fit for watched him returned rosalie positively i think for it he has worked under job for some time and is a i think he will manage very well as to abel i shall put in his place for i mean to sell the pigs the pigs ejaculated this time year his absolutely tragic but rosalie merely nodded to become your skim milk he gasped the whey will be no skim milk said rosalie shall make blue as i used to make when i was with my grandfather some very fond of it that is made entirely of skim milk you know the whey there will not be much nourishment in it but i shall few sows still just to consume that and the butter milk they require much attention as they walk about here you see and there a lot of waste green stuff think find many folks here what cares for the blue said isaac still much dejected is all the they likes hereabouts the blue vinney has gone out fashion so they buy them here i can send them to dorchester said resolutely used to buy them up there faster than i them so you see there will be no waste mr sharpe there will work to do outside and therefore i shall not miss job or abel but we shall be very busy in the dairy i must have two or three to help me stared at her ruefully she looked brighter than she had done death but she also looked determined he shook his his mind was of the strictly conservative order and abolition of pigs from the premises of this large dairy to him an almost sacrilegious innovation moreover to sell july to make cheeses that nobody in that part of the world cared to replace two seasoned men who knew their their that dangerous commodity seemed to him utterly wild and pregnant with disaster mean to do it said rosalie defying the condemnation in his face this time next year you will congratulate me on my success hope so i am sure said isaac in a slightly offended tone to advise but it seems ye want no advice yes i do she cried softening in a moment value it of mr sharpe my one comfort in my difficulties is the i can talk them over with you i have laid my plan before you in the hope that you would approve my dear said isaac somewhat mollified approve since you ask my advice tell ye plain that i think will work ye be able to sell your pigs to begin with want a man more experience than sam to look after the cows such easy that it then as to the place i hold with the notion i think benefit ye my dear i trewly appeared to meditate it over mrs fiander he urged do nothing in a hurry be my advice you very much yes think it over come on sunday you mr sharpe agreed isaac doubtfully come on sunday i be you be thinking of taking my advice mrs fiander am grateful to you for giving it said rosalie with a sweet smile the farmer walked away thinking that on the whole women were unreasonable than he had hitherto supposed next day was closing day at no surprised when mrs fiander having as she averred some business in the town ordered the gig in the forenoon it was the first had used that vehicle since her death and she enough as she climbed into it clad in her deepest weeds steady old horse looked round when she gathered up the reins wondering at the elias had always been was with some difficulty induced to start be so wise as a christian that he be commented bundy as and its occupant disappeared was a and a so sensible as i mid do myself but have to get used change the same as the rest of us not like it so very well returned a woman a whip in her hand and she fancies to lay it on nigger was suffered to jog along the road at his own pace for sadness which had fallen upon rosalie had for a moment checked spirit and a new preoccupation was moreover now added to it elias approve of what she was about to do or would he agree no surely he would say that she knew best he was always anything she did he used to say that she was the best manager ever known and on the other hand used frequently to speak with good humoured derision it will be seen that mrs meditations over her advice had resulted as have been expected in the determination to adhere to her and she was now on her way to interview two personages operation would be necessary in carrying it out appearance in the shop of mr hardy the principal grocer of caused a certain amount of commotion everybody turned to look beautiful young widow who had indeed for many days past formed topic of conversation among the townsfolk and much aroused by her murmured request to see mr hardy in private mrs fiander step this way john open the hardy a tall good looking young man in a white linen jacket to obey his behest and was even good enough the visitor along the passage which led from the shop to sitting room it was empty at this hour mrs hardy occupied in household duties and mr john ushered rosalie much ceremony and invited her to be seated in the best armchair disappointment was perceptible in his ingenuous countenance when that the interview which had been so mysteriously asked for connected with cheese but his father listened to with grave attention exactly see how the plan would work he remarked shaking sell your cheeses very fairly well mrs fiander hardy was a discreet person and was determined not to as for the blue vinney be very glad to oblige you really see scarcely any demand for blue a few of the old folks ask for it now and then but we not to say a custom for and it would be worth to keep it am considered a particularly good hand at making blue vinney used to be quite celebrated for it when i lived fact i could easily sell my cheeses now at dorchester i thought i would give you the first offer as you have dealt with long warm in her excitement she threw back her veil john hardy at her flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes thought mrs fiander looked so handsome as in her weeds commented the senior would be a long way for you am sure put in the son quickly be sorry to think as mrs should need to take her cheeses to dorchester father elder mr hardy glanced from one to the other of the two young faces as rosalie bestowed a grateful smile upon his son an idea seemed him he said good naturedly are trying an experiment mrs fiander always a certain amount risk in but still venture nothing have they say willing to venture i shall be glad to help you all i can cheeses to me and do my best to sell i promise money down for he added cautiously as i do for but try sell for you and we can settle about am very much obliged said rosalie a little blankly however had not been accustomed to do business in this manner will use our utmost endeavours to push the that you may cried young john eagerly and she smiled upon him again that he somewhat lost his head and made several as to the excellence of blue vinney cheese for which father subsequently brought him to book not the way to get round a woman my lad he remarked f just think you be right down silly the notion her vinney cheese was richer to the palate than altogether good new milk and this but skim cheese skim instead it to the pigs and you go her all that rubbish no widow is is way to make up to her rosalie had driven across the market place and up a side the house of a certain auctioneer and to her great joy found him was a stout middle aged man with some pretensions to good looks to being a dandy he was attired in a sporting costume of cut and received his visitor with an air of jovial hospitality to see you sure mrs fiander i feel h onoured i your service for anything you may may command me had begun by expressing a desire to transact a little him and now proceeded to explain its nature wish to sell my pigs by auction she said have about sixty dispose of and i should like the sale to take place as early next week week ejaculated the auctioneer his face falling said rosalie with great decision you considered the question it would be difficult to sell a number of pigs at any season of the year but the height summer if i may advise you mrs fiander be in such a hurry and sell the pigs at a more convenient time killing and most people as go in for fatting pigs have got as many as by this time must be next week said the widow obstinately job and abel on the saturday and the stock must be got rid of before the began lose to a certainty said mr wilson running his his well oiled hair with all the regulations on the swine fever the selling of such a number of pigs would be any season as i say and you give me no to get out my sale must take place before saturday week insisted rosalie do the best you can for me mr wilson may rely on that mrs fiander but it really grieves me to you should lose so much paused thoughtfully biting the end of one finger and suffering meanwhile to travel slowly over the handsome face and of his client during this scrutiny he was not unobservant of materials of which her dress was composed and her of mournful prosperity tell you what do he said against my but i always like to oblige a such a lady mrs fiander drive round the country and see if i people to buy up those pigs by private contract i know jobber over shaftesbury side as might be glad to take a good many if he got them at a low price if i understand you mrs fiander price is not an object to you faltered rosalie course i should like as much money for them but the price is not so important as to get rid of as soon as possible so agreed the auctioneer cheerfully mrs fiander lose by it as i say but i will try and arrange matters for you way under the circumstances i grudge no time or in your service i am always thought to be a wife used to say that my consideration for ladies injured but as i used to tell her a man has a heart or else he if he has a he has more feelings than his neighbours to blame for it the business go my dear i say ask me to be hard on a woman had been whispered among the gossips of branston that during of the late mrs wilson her lord had been wont to correct with a boot jack but these rumours had not ears and even if they had she would probably have nevertheless she did not quite like the manner in which auctioneer leered at her nor his unnecessarily warm pressure hand on saying good bye drove homewards with a mixture of feelings the inauguration of plan seemed to involve a considerable amount of risk not to she felt conscious of the fact that she owed her very more to the persuasion of her beauty than to faith in as a woman of business yet there was after all thinking that she had carried her point he that will not love must my scholar and learn this of me there be in love as many as the corn has ears thou know besides all these how hard a woman is to please how cross how sullen and how she shifts and changes like the moon herrick was with some trepidation that rosalie awaited visit on following that long and eventful week the good fellow was so overcome when he found himself seated once more in chair with the vacant place opposite to him that she had to make a confession which would she knew distress and confession which would have to be made nevertheless own eyes filled as she saw isaac unaffectedly wiping away his his great red and yellow handkerchief and for some moments no spoken between them she filled his pipe and lit it for him but it to rest idly between his fingers and made no attempt to the tumbler of spirits and water which she placed at his elbow talk of him she murmured softly at last bending forward me about when you knew him first said sharpe with a sniff him all his life i may say were with him when he were i were at both his was the only one i was at straightened herself feeling as if a douche of cold water unexpectedly applied to her went on isaac shaking his head mournfully knowed his fust second missus was nice women both on the fust was near but as poor used to say a good fault ah good fault put his pipe between his lips and immediately took it out again second mrs fiander he went on a good delicate though but make allowances her though it did seem to me sometimes as it was a bit a man when his wife got the just at the busiest time of year he used to tell me often as it were no use to be a dairy you had a active wife fidgeted in her chair these little anecdotes of isaac seemed rather pointless under the present circumstances i can say is she remarked after a pause i always dear elias the most considerate of men ye did said isaac turning his moist eyes upon her a deal did that says he to me the first night i when you come home arter getting wed says he best the three was comfort in this thought and rosalie looked gratefully at whose eyes had again become suffused with tears as he touching tribute used to say she observed presently in a low voice i was good manager but i think it was on that account alone he fond of me he did use to say you was a wonderful manager said isaac the latter part of the sentence a time a that you had got no equal as a manager was evidently not to be the order of the day but here was an opportunity of introducing the little matter of weighed so heavily on conscience think she said diffidently would say i was wise in this new plan new plan inquired isaac pausing with his handkerchief halfway eyes and turning towards her sternly though the tears hung upon lashes the one i spoke to you doing away with the pigs she returned faintly there notion that i ye my advice agen said sharpe grimly hesitatingly thought it over as you told me to and i think i could manage differently i find i can sell the pigs and mr hardy has promised to try and dispose of my blue blew his nose returned his handkerchief to his pocket and glad to hear as ye can manage so well he said sarcastically want no advice plain and i never offer you wish ye good day mrs fiander go away like that cried she piteously with me such an old this moment a figure passed across the window and a loud knock at the house door rosalie rushed to the door of the parlour let any one in susan she cried engaged stay a minute mr want to tell want to explain out one hand in pleading she held open the parlour door an two with the other and presently the manly tones of mr cross through the chink am sorry to hear that mrs fiander is engaged will you kindly that i will call next sunday him susan said her mistress opening the door a little way under her him that i am always engaged on sunday was heard to impart this information and then the heard again a pity tell her if you please that i shall to have of finding her at home some afternoon during the week am always out in the afternoon said rosalie speaking this time that it was not necessary for susan to repeat her words said the young man addressing this time not the maid but eye of which he caught a glimpse through the door i my chance of finding you in the morning am too busy to see anyone in the morning retorted rosalie and the door with a finality which left mr cross no option but see i do take your advice sometimes said rosalie turning and speaking in a plaintive tone though a little smile her mouth back was towards her and he made no reply as she approached form however she saw his shoulders heave and presently to relief discovered that he was shaking with silent laughter my dear ye do things by say that for a got rid that there chap anyhow not ax again well well if ye manage as well in other ways say that ye fit to look arter yourself it was your advice you know mr sharpe she said demurely me the hint about shutting the door i did said isaac and being a good natured and his transitory sense of resentment was soon replaced by of the humorous side of the situation discomfiture of samuel cross gave a salutary lesson not only but to sundry other adventurous young men who had been a in their overtures to mrs fiander it was soon noised abroad young widow wished for the present to keep herself to herself as went and that it would in consequence be advisable to making advances to least until she had laid aside her crape some months therefore rosalie enjoyed comparative immunity from which had so much annoyed her while the new to work amazingly well both within and without littlecomb farm and abel departed in due course the pigs were to their owner sam was installed as chief cowman and sustained cheerfully without however appearing to be unduly elated strapping damsels were engaged as dairy maids with operation mrs fiander turned out weekly a score and more of cheeses which were stowed away in an upper room until in time they should become sufficiently people might use have earned their title of cheese process took a considerable time and meanwhile the profits of were a good deal lessened since rosalie had left off making cheeses for which she had been so particularly famed and she had invariably received regular payment still as she when the blue vinneys were disposed of she would receive in a lump sum and all would be the same in the end chief trouble at this time arose from the frequent calls of mr the auctioneer who though he could not be said to be attention to rosalie found nevertheless sundry excuses and conversing with her at all manner of he made as has been implied no direct advances and rosalie could not treat him so unceremoniously as she had treated mr for she felt in a manner indebted to him about the sale of pigs he had carried the matter through for her with to himself as he frequently assured her and he had all remuneration it was hard therefore for the young widow or avoid him and she was in consequence reluctantly obliged many hours of his society your own fair youth you care so little for it smiling towards heaven you would not stay the of time and change upon your happiest fancies i keep your golden hour and will restore it alice meynell september day rosalie betook herself to the little churchyard lay at rest three months had elapsed since he had been taken and she had not let a week pass without visiting and decorating she thought of him often and her affectionate regret was in diminished yet though she was now on her way to perform melancholy duty she advanced with a bright face and a step was young full of vigour and elasticity and on such a day exquisite golden day full of sunshine and yet with a of approaching autumn in the fibre of her with the very joy of life she knelt by her grave however her face became her movements slow taking a pair of garden shears from the she carried she clipped the short grass closer still laid gently down on the smooth surface placed the dead ones in and after lingering a moment bent forward and kissed the headstone she rose and turned to go away her face still shadowed by she suddenly perceived that she was not alone at a from her ensconced within the angle of the churchyard wall was sitting with an easel in front of him above the large board easel she caught sight of a brown velveteen coat and a flannel fastened with a brilliant tie also of a dark face framed long black hair and shaded by a soft felt hat of peculiar shape beneath its tilted brim however a pair of keen dark eyes with intense curiosity at the young woman and though he held in one hand and a brush in the other he was evidently in her than in his painting vexed that her recent display of feeling had been observed stranger walked quickly down the little path colouring high the while and assuming that stately carriage which to her in such emergencies gentleman turned slowly on his camp stool his eyes twinkling and moustache twitching and watched her till she was out of sight was clad in her morning print and wore her wide brimmed so that her attire gave no indication of her station in life tall figure disappeared the man rose stepped past his a canvas whereon already appeared in bold firm lines a the antiquated church made his way up the path and grass to elias grave us see he murmured kiss spoke volumes it must be at the very least yet when she came swinging down path she certainly looked heart whole here we brand funny fiander sixty two must have been or perhaps her girl looked young all romance has come to nothing i wish she had stayed a few would give something to make a sketch of her went back to his work whistling and thinking over and figure regretfully and with an admiration that was for he had a cheery rotund little wife at home in london a dozen children to provide for so that he was not given was perhaps because his admiration was so innocent and his laudable that a few days later his wish to transfer canvas was granted in a most unexpected way had been unusually hot and the artist having finished his sketch porch was proceeding by a short cut through littlecomb farm to beyond in search of cooler air when on crossing a cornfield further end of which the reapers were busily at work he upon a figure lying in the shade of a of sheaves first glance announced her identity the second assured him that fast asleep she had removed her hat and her clasped her head the upward curve of the beautiful arms fascinating to the eye the oval face with its the slightly loosened masses of dark hair were thrown relief by the golden background the absolute abandonment of form was so perfect in its grace that he paused trembling delight and hardly daring to breathe lest he should rosalie overcome with the heat and tired out after a hard slept peacefully on while he swung his satchel round opened and began with swift deft fingers to make a rapid sketch of her few light pencil strokes suggested the exquisite lines of the and he had already begun to dash on the colour when with a and flapping of wings a blackbird flew out of the and rosalie stirred and opened her eyes eyes always took people by surprise and the artist who before noticed their colour suffered his to rest upon while they were still hazy with sleep but when consciousness he observed a sudden wonder and indignation them he threw out his hand hastily moment if you just as you are for one moment under the influence of her recent heavy slumber and taken aback peremptory tone rosalie obeyed are you doing she inquired suspiciously but without changing you see he returned am making a picture of you warm tide of colour spread over the upturned face should do that without asking my leave man must take his chances where he finds them said the artist often get such a chance as this i am a poor man and let an opportunity slip had a shrewd sallow face and kind merry eyes and as he spoke in his work and smiled down at her want to be disobliging said rosalie like it fell asleep by should have thrown myself down like i had thought anyone was likely to see me the better commented he could have put yourself a position if you had tried to it has evidently come naturally it is simply perfect paused to squeeze out a little colour from one of the tiny tubes open box and again smiled encouragingly down at his model will you oblige me by closing your eyes again no screw like that let the lids drop very good is a pity the does not often see blue eyes with such but the length of the lashes makes amends and i want a wave of colour swept over face the stranger marked and worked on it nearly done she inquired presently said you would only moment find it will take several moments but i am sure you would not the time if you knew what a wonderful piece of good fortune this me can it be good fortune for you frown please let the lids lie loosely i will tell you why this meeting a piece of good fortune do you know what it is bread and butter make butter three times a week returned rosalie somewhat amused i make bread too sometimes i have got to make bread and butter every day of my life not myself but for my wife and six small children and i have nothing it with but this you may open your eyes for a moment if you otherwise opened her eyes and saw that he was bending towards her out a paint brush go to sleep again he went on what i make and butter with and it is always an easy task because a great many other chaps who want to make bread and butter in kind of way and we can never be quite sure which among the lot will find the best market for his wares but i shall have in disposing of you i am i consider luck you mean that you will sell that little picture of me this one but a big one which i shall make from it it will go exhibition and people will come and look at it as the subject new and very pretty i shall ask a big price for it and there lots of bread and butter for a long time to come would anybody care to buy a picture of a woman whom they know asleep in a cornfield cried rosalie incredulously raising her drooped lids certainly they will responded the artist confidently a lovely thing when it is done i shall come here to morrow and careful study of this stook against which you are lying and of and i shall look about for a few good types of harvesters to the middle distance he was speaking more to himself than to her rosalie listened with deep interest and watched him sharply half closed lids suddenly she saw him laugh if i come across a very attractive specimen of a rustic i him just behind the stook here peering through the sheaves at you bending forward as if he were going cried rosalie starting violently and opening her eyes wide i have it i be in the picture at all if you of that kind in i chose a particularly nice young man inquired the painter laughing softly to himself if i the young man am sure i know what you mean protested she her cheeks and her lips quivering is no young man you mean to tell me my dear child that with that face you till now without anyone courting i suppose they would of course they court me rosalie hastened to admit i all and they are all very ugly she added eagerly dreadful in a picture you are frowning again come let us talk of something keep still please so you make butter three times a week you are a daughter i suppose was a granddaughter she returned father was that accounts for your educated way of speaking father died when i was quite a baby but my grandfather sent me you live with your mother i suppose i live alone here this farm belongs to me could not help peeping out beneath her lashes to judge of the her words and was gratified when the busy brush paused and the glanced down at her in astonishment live alone here but this is a big manage it i do it is hard work but i contrive to do it i am though will be remedied in time said the artist encouragingly man will come along and perhaps he added with that queer his find him so ugly as the rest know who i am or you would speak like that said dignity adding with a softer inflexion of her voice has gone i am a widow unclasping the hands beneath her head she thrust forward the with the shining wedding ring and concern now replaced the careless gaiety of the beg your pardon he said earnestly did not know you look could not i am very sorry for my foolish talk was married four years said rosalie softly something gentle about the man invited confidence poor elias has only three months she paused abruptly astonished at the of blank bewilderment on the face name was he queried beg your pardon for seem idle curiosity was it his grave that i saw the other day said rosalie sighing and blushing thought i aged sixty two quoted the artist to himself and he raised his his mouth for a moment to conceal its tell tale quivering he the elastic gait on the morning when he had first seen her once more the blooming face and admirably proportioned him then shaking his head slowly went on with his work i shall call this picture sleeping beauty he a pause with apparent irrelevance know the story but i think it would be a good name she was a princess to sleep in a palace in the wood and i am just my asleep in a cornfield are mere details said he main points of the story are she woke up all right you know you will wake up some day too beauty put such meaning into the words and smiled down at her so oddly felt confused and uncomfortable it was not that her pride at the liberty he had taken in applying such a term to her was so evidently impersonal that it could not offend her and his allusion to his wife and children had had a but the look and tone when he made this strange her with vague disquietude both betrayed a secret with something like compassion would wake up some day but she did not want to wake up she was quite least as could be in her bereaved asked nothing more from life would be certainly more unpleasant than the reverse to discover had surprises in store for her but why need she trouble a prophecy so idly uttered and by an absolute stranger she did trouble herself not only throughout the the time that the artist was completing his sketch but will wake up some day my beauty oh no no let her sleep on placid contented existence were indeed sleep let her dream away in peace until that time of awakening which would re unite her then proud celinda hope no to be or since by thy scorn thou dost the wealth my love and thy disdain too late shall that none are fair but who are kind thomas stanley the artist had gone away after lingering some days longer his studies for the projected picture the tenor of flowed on as calmly as even she could desire she made her butter had her cheeses conveyed to mr establishment superintended the harvesting of her potatoes and mangels her winter store of oil cake and fattened sundry turkeys and the christmas market on a afternoon rosalie fiander might have been slowly across the downs in the neighbourhood of isaac she carried a large basket and every now and then paused to the store of scarlet berries or shining evergreen which she from thicket and hedgerow for christmas decoration at once she was surprised by hearing a step on the path behind a voice calling her name and turning descried the tall ungainly person of andrew burge it wanted yet a few days of christmas that gentleman who was social turn of mind had evidently begun to celebrate the festival gazing at him was somewhat dismayed on perceiving

manner increased her discomposure all at once she saw that a mistletoe was tucked into the band of mr head gear at the moment she made this discovery he lurched forward so as her progress and bent his

the ground by the catastrophe and the peculiar appearance presented flushed and dazed countenance as he stared contemplating probably a thousand stars isaac seized the the legs and began to drag it across the floor bumping its in his exertions his own countenance was indeed purple in hue as by the time he reached the door which thrown open as he neared it revealing sam the alarmed countenances of the maids peered over his shoulder a few manly forms were huddled together in the passage mr extremely audible tones had attracted many eager listeners so exciting had taken place at littlecomb

scattered senses summons you mr sharpe he cried liberties of the is not to be interfered with i leave this spot looking round loftily but unsteadily contumely who had subsequently seen sam and robert conducting the suitor high road would have endorsed the truth of this remark though mr according to his custom had merely used the first long word to him without any regard to its appropriateness to the house isaac went to the foot of the stairs and name in a mildly jubilant roar down mrs fiander come down my dear he be gone and trouble you no more answer for came tripping downstairs smiling in

calling and calling and he follows me about and pays is very tiresome he returned the farmer with a clouded brow and he for you to be notice on nohow give the sack if you you see i like to be rude and he was kind about the pigs i wish some one would drop him a hint that he is wasting his time about me broke off suddenly for at that moment the interested and of sam belbin appeared in the doorway and

he eleven weeks and strange to say when he and my mother did wed did have eleven children routed by this incontrovertible testimony mrs belbin her own quarters leaving the other two ragged heads bobbing high enjoyment of the delectable piece of gossip the morrow the entire village knew that farmer sharpe had littlecomb with his arm round widow waist that he to her in the tenderest terms had avowed his intention each and every one of her suitors and had bought himself new and beautifully embroidered smock frock for the express courting her in it disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprising what they look on shakespeare isaac sharpe did not consider himself bound to assist rosalie the advances of mr wilson the auctioneer the wish she that someone would be kind enough to a hint to upon other attentive and willing ears belbin had laid her words to heart and only waited for of proving his good will by ridding her of a frequent visitor chance came at last and he was quick to take advantage of it was cheese day and rosalie and her maids had prepared such a their work was not as usual finished before dinnertime and still elbow deep in curds when mr wilson chanced to look in was standing in the outer room swilling out the great cheese had held that morning a hundred and eighty gallons of skim milk obliging fellow was sam always ready to lend a hand here an odd job there and so good tempered with it all his often see his smiling mouth open and ready to agree with he thought her likely to make long before she had spoken and liked contradiction as little as any of her sex her head man more rapidly in her favour was anything but gratified when mr wilson appeared on the the milk house and after a brief greeting bent her head over and went on with her work busy mrs fiander remarked the visitor pleasantly you ladies put us to shame sometimes we men are idle creatures with you made no answer and sam banged about the vat with his stiff energetically that he seemed bent on giving the lie to words am really quite curious to see how you set about your cheese making the latter in mellifluous tones i be in your way mrs if i was to step in and watch you am afraid you would find it very amusing responded course if you like but it will really be for you we are all in such a mess here a din you do make with that tub who had tilted up the tub the better apparently to scrub now let it go suddenly sending a great portion of its across the floor in mr direction be all the same he remarked philosophically were just a swill out this here place with that he upset a little more of the steaming water upon seized a stiff broom and began to brush the soapy liquid door might have waited a moment commented his mistress but she a sweet smile for she saw with the corner of her eye how wilson had skipped out of the way anxious to protect his and immaculate leggings really cannot invite you in now turning to the visitor regretfully excuse the but as she spoke she smiled again on sam related the anecdote with much gusto to isaac sharpe on the but he did not seem to appreciate it as much as she had expected there wilson arter you too i suppose i would to say to him if i was you he steady enough to make and sich like ah his poor wife praise him but she suffered poor soul mr sharpe i am sure you need warn me you know what are besides i hate the man i would see him at all if he been rather obliging in a business way but was of sam to get rid of him like that agreed the farmer dubiously go for to let too much on hisself my dear else be like to repent it never do to let these young fellows get sot up keep in mrs fiander let get presumptious sure he would never be that she rejoined warmly sam humblest creature in the world he goes about his work be so said isaac incredulously know him best i suppose jist thought speak my mind out about him frowned a little and said no more but her faith in sam was and as time went on she grew to rely more and more on and obliging young fellow gossiping anent the alleged courting of mrs fiander by farmer not confined to littlecomb village but soon spread to the town of branston with the immediate result of stirring of the young men belonging to that place who after of samuel cross had deemed it prudent to relax for a their attentions to the fascinating widow so long as she had plunged in grief these wooers of hers had been content to time but when it became known that there was actually an in the field and one moreover to whom the lady had tokens of confidence and good will they resolved with to bestir themselves lest the prize of which each thought deserving might be secured by another many days of the new year had passed rosalie found besieged samuel cross actually forced his way past susan into the parlour while rosalie was at tea mr wilson wait for her as she was emerging from church on christmas day his proposal in due form as he escorted her homewards john the widow into the back parlour behind the shop ostensibly the sale of the blue vinneys in reality to lay his hand at her feet said to one and all and was astonished at the outburst which her answer provoked and at the keen sense of ill which every one of her suitors appeared to be labouring was samuel cross who first alluded in hearing to belief that farmer sharpe was paying his court to her and somewhat taken aback by the unfeigned merriment which the may laugh mrs fiander he said recovering himself after people are not blind and deaf and though they may to a certain extent by a lady gentlemen of my profession find to put two and two together when a lady tells you she engaged on a sunday and shuts the door in the face of a comes to make civil inquiries one does need to be extra guess that there must be some reason for it and when the out to be another gentleman and when that gentleman takes to assault another gentleman as was also desirous of paying in the same quarter that mrs fiander is what one may primâ facie evidence the display of mr learning had a sobering effect on mrs or whether she was suddenly struck by some serious thought certain that she ceased laughing at this juncture and even after the rejected suitor had departed wilson was harder to get rid of he was so confident in the his claim so pertinacious in reminding rosalie of her him with regard to the sales of the piece of perseveringly alluded to as delicate persuaded of his own superiority to any of her other lovers that lost patience and petulantly declared that if there were man in the world she would not consent to marry him auctioneer grew purple in the face and suddenly changed his note there was another man in the world he repeated sneeringly there is another man ha it is very hard to guess who well differ if you like such a rough common old chap better than doing a large and honourable business i make you a present mrs fiander smock frock and all ha ha soon have the again when master here and all my labour and loss of time been thrown away not that i grudge the sacrifice cried mr in a melting tone far be it from me to grudge the ladies have always found an easy prey in me and when of the far greater sacrifice which a young and lovely woman to make upon the altar of sacrifice which she too am rejooced to silence mr wilson thumped his breast and cast a last languishing look young widow who appeared however to be absorbed in her talked on in spite of his last assertion until they reached where waking as if from a dream she extended her hand to him bye she said is no use in talking about it any more mr my mind is made up auctioneer extended his hand dramatically in the direction of pigsties mrs fiander he cried the inspector of nuisances premises you will only have yourself to thank retorted rosalie with some acerbity it might be difficult to send for him to day i should be glad if the is now occupying my premises would take himself off went into the house with a flushed face but seemed more annoyed during the remainder of the day was however with unmixed vexation that she perused on the her rejection of young john hardy a document signed by which ran thus mrs fiander madam re blue vinney cheeses regret to inform you that we no longer allow our premises to be used as a storehouse for unsaleable articles in the three months during which in order oblige you we have placed our establishment at your disposal have only found one purchaser for a small portion of the goods question as you will see per statement copied from our books enclosed herewith under these circumstances we are returning you to day as many of the cheeses as the cart can convey and we shall be obliged by your removing the remainder at earliest convenience we are madam yours obediently son enclosed testified to the purchase by one margaret ¾ lb blue vinney cse at 5¾ d 4 d which sum had been mrs account gave a little gasp and tears of vexation sprang to her eyes just want to spite me she said course the cheeses fit for use have even tried to dispose of them simply pretended to sell them so as to entrap me and now they them back on my hands before i have time to think what to them that odious john hardy mean spirited is all as she thus cogitated there was a rattling of wheels without cart drew up with a flourish at the door cried susan thrusting in her head smith be ever so many cheeses as he says hardys are sending back and and eightpence to pay and he says will you please men to unload them at once sam said her mistress in a strangled voice him to come with two or three of the others and to take the cheeses the cheese room be full i doubt not room for them there we was you know till christmas over a bit to send the last load to town them up in the dairy then for the present well why she cried irritably as the girl remained staring at her men get to work at once while i find my purse she came down from her room purse in hand she observed through window the blank faces of sam and his underlings as tossed the cheeses to them from the cart grinning the while at some excellent joke she stamped her foot and caught with a little angry sob she had been so proud in despatching load after load of these fine round cheeses she had herself on the wisdom and cleverness of this expedient now to have them ignominiously thrown back at her without disposed of be turned into a laughing stock for her own well as for the whole town of branston to be actually made to pay ill success of her experiment rosalie was as a rule open handed enough but the disbursal of this and eightpence caused her a pang of almost physical anguish an hour later when the carrier had departed and the men returned work she entered the dairy and stood gazing with clasped a melancholy countenance at the heaps of despised blue vinneys piled up on every side her presently came sam belbin his arms dangling limply by his sides expression duly composed to sympathetic gloom sam exclaimed rosalie in a heartbroken tone pointing the nearest yellow mound would take on sure mum responded sam with a ghastly smile now i would take on was very ill done mr do say but that never do care for cheese to poor is all bacon bacon he to fill your stummicks that there cheese i a heard myself a bit bacon as stand to ye hot or cold ejaculated rosalie with a note of even deeper woe then to the cheeses again she groaned sam was it worth rid of the this heart alive mum responded belbin plucking up his courage more cheerfully hardy the only grocer in branston be a many more as be proud glad to sell them cheeses no why the story must be all over the town by one at them in branston everyone will know that mr hardy packed to me no if i sell them at all i must send them away perhaps and that be a good notion mum commented belbin better price for them there i lard at dorchester the cheeses do go off like smoke is always a sale for them there to be sure said rosalie less lugubriously our own horses and carts take them there in less than no time sam more and more confidently have just fell it be a to take up to night and i be will just exercise the horses nicely to get and make carry them cheeses to will be the as do them good and cost ye nothing he sam you are a good comforter cried his mistress brightening the influence of his cheerfulness is a blessing i am sure have someone about one who does croak turned to him as she spoke with one of her radiant smile which very quickly vanished for face wore a most my dear he cried casting an ardent look upon her be to hear ye say so ax better nor to be about ye always comfort do for ye so well as i could is a thing with modest candour a had in my mind for some time did like to speak afore i was sure as relish the notion now as a hinted so had averted her face for a moment but as he advanced towards extended arm she flashed round upon him a glance which him remained staring at her with goggling eyes and a dropping jaw awful pause which succeeded heaved a sigh of relief however when she at last broke silence spoke calmly and her words seemed innocuous enough that your coat hanging up behind the door mum responded sam no longer the lover but the very and get it then your cap i think is on the table fumbled in her pocket for a moment and presently drew forth from which she counted out the sum of fourteen shillings had a steely glitter in them as she fixed them on sam are your wages she said them and walk out of pleaded sam piteously out of this house repeated rosalie pointing mercilessly to never let me see your face again out of my sight she as he still hesitated inarticulate protests died upon his lips and he turned and rosalie looking after him with gleaming eyes until his figure to sight follow a shadow it still flies you seem to fly it it will pursue so court a mistress she denies you let her alone she will court you say are not women truly then styled but the shadows of us men ben jonson who by resolves and vows does for days that yet belong to fate does like an unthrift mortgage his before it falls into his hand abraham cowley sharpe receiving no answer to his knock walked straight into the room was dark save for the smouldering glow of the fire it was some time before he discovered figure huddled up chair what be to do he inquired stooping over her mr sharpe returned she with a strangled sob have had such have been so insulted oh how shall i ever forget it what can done to bring about such a thing cried the farmer much alarmed is it my dear it and have some light to see ourselves by that he seized the poker and stirred the logs on the hearth flared up with a brightness almost painful to aching eyes saw the traces of tears upon her flushed face and his heard ye was in trouble again he said i thought cheeses as been a making of ever since midsummer is back hands they tell me said rosalie faintly are piles and piles of them in and mr hardy wrote a most ill natured letter about them in the place will think me a fool but it is that i mind shall sell those cheeses somewhere i suppose and i know mr only sent them back out of spite because i would marry put in isaac interested hardy axed ye did he and have course not she returned petulantly mrs f said isaac leaning forward in his chair and mid done worse nor take him is in my mind on emphatically soon or late have to take a second but me what was it as upset ye so much to day am almost ashamed to say it sam know sam that common i made cowman out of pure kindness and because i thought lout has actually dared to make love to me now commented isaac nodding you not amazed did you ever hear of such impudence he dared me and he seemed to think that i his mistress encouraged him he said something about my dropping a hint i soon let him see what i thought of him i packed him off on ye said isaac my beg fiander i of course she put in quickly mind your saying is a very different matter as i was a pursued the farmer ignoring these niceties altogether so very much surprised a heard some about you and sam this very day a heard to say the truth that were the reason why i looked in thought it best not to wait till sunday not one but i thought it only kind to let ye know what folks in be sharpe her eyes positively you mean to tell me know me so little as to gossip about me and that low fellow my dear cried isaac catching the infection of her excitement no knowing what folks do be ready to believe thing why bithey did actually tell me is common talk village as you and me be a to make a match of it who had been leaning forward in her chair suddenly sank back drew a long breath and then said in a very small voice isaac i believe it will have to come to that even sam belbin withering under his scornful gaze at her with such blank dismay as that now perceptible on face covered her own with both hands but presently dropped points to it she said firmly see yourself go on as they are i find i manage the her voice broke but she pursued after a minute the i am competent to undertake has not succeeded elias would grieved to see everything going wrong like this he who was such man of so regular and particular groaned isaac it very near break his heart must be a master here went on rosalie you were forced just now that i ought to marry again agreed isaac unwillingly it be a very good thing broke off gazing at her with an expression almost akin to terror you suppose for a moment she cried with spirit i would to put a stranger in my dear place could been his friend so long bear to see one of the jumpers master here i wonder at you isaac sharpe now protested the farmer did say i wished no such thing fiander i said was my opinion as be forced to take and you might do worse nor think john hardy is he a counter jumper interrupted rosalie vehemently others besides he returned sharpe weakly would you choose then cried she to drink and my hard earned money andrew burge perhaps whom out of this house with your own hands or that little ferret know how to manage a dairy farm would he to see him strutting about and giving orders here i tell you is isaac sharpe if you have no respect for dear memory be glad that i have says i have respect for memory thundered isaac goaded into a fury known a deal longer nor you have fiander and no one in this world as thought more on him i says a knowed i were never man i believe added isaac with an emphatic thump table believe as if were alive expect it of me dead you see returned rosalie with a sudden pathetic dead and that is why everything is going wrong i think of making a change myself if i did feel it was the to do you loved elias you knew his ways you would carry on just as he used to would be like putting a stranger in i would do it if i could help it she added sobbing should both try to do our duty by elias visibly moved rolled his eyes towards her and heaved a course if you put it that way he began and then his him and be became once more mute would be such a bad thing for you mr sharpe went on is a very fine farm and a good business it would for you to work the two farms together have quite this is a very comfortable house agreed isaac is a good house but i have no need for content the one where i were born but that do at all cried rosalie with sudden animation have to live object of my marrying you would be that live here a lived in my own house ever i were born said the when a man weds he takes his wife to live him when the wife has got the best house of the two retorted mrs man live in two houses asserted isaac adding after a pause would ye have me do with mine then could put your head man to live in it returned she of course or you could let it to somebody would in that way by one entrenchments were being carried no resource to him but to capitulate or to take flight he chose the is not a thing as a body can make up his mind to in a hurry must think it over mrs fiander before she could make the sharp retort which had risen to her had darted to the door it closed behind him rosalie sprang to her feet and began to about the room what had she done she had actually in so made an offer of marriage to isaac she was not of being accepted there was the rub elias was an old man yet wooed her in her homeless penniless condition with a of ardour in her widowhood she had been courted doubtless on account of her wealth as of her beauty but certainly with of eagerness and now when she had turned with to this old friend and practically laid herself her and good fortune at his feet he had promised unwillingly to over it was not to be would send him to the right his return let his decision be what it might but then came remembrance of the failures and humiliations which had unassisted enterprises the importunities of of all the confident leer on sam face what a miserable fate was hers she dared not so much as servant but he must needs try to take advantage of her lamp was lit and tea set forth but rosalie left it untasted upon she was still pacing restlessly about the room when isaac this time without any preliminary knock closed the door behind him and advanced towards the young woman wearing a benign if somewhat sheepish smile be come to tell you he said come round to the notion paused beaming down at her with the air of a man who was making pleasant announcement and rosalie who was gifted with genuine sense of humour could not for the life of her repeated isaac valiantly a comed round to the notion a bit shy materimony by reason the cat and dog life mother and father did lead but i as no need to about you made different my dear and been a to more he went on cheerfully i was a myself is same as if i was to go and put myself in the so to speak by and of ye to have me then ye well cast up at me some day if i was satisfied but when a young woman comes and axes a man as a favour her it be a different story it stopped laughing and glanced at him indignantly the way in which you look at it mr sharpe she said we had better give up the idea how dare you she burst dare you tell me to my face that i asked you as a favour am not the kind of person to pray and beseech you you know as well do that other people are ready to fall on their knees if i but hold finger a good few of them are agreed isaac dispassionately ye ye see well and at the first go off when i was took so to speak i thought i did want you not as objections to you he added handsomely because i on changing my state but now as a thought it over my dear remained silent her eyes downcast her hands nervously unclasping each other he went on do my dooty by and my dooty by you been a good wife to he and be the same to me no doubt paused passing his hand meditatively over his grizzled locks comforting himself with the reflection that in this case there would be no need to supply himself with such a box as that dolefully shown to him by his father want to do my duty by elias said the poor young widow at last in voice i want you to sacrifice yourself since you is a sacrifice if you hate me so much marry me isaac passionately my dear who ever said i hated far from it i do like much liked from the first knowed i liked more about a sacrifice it no sacrifice to speak on i upset to see how bad you was a on be a comfort as i can look arter you and look arter the place you and me the best friends and go on the best we are man and wife i say no fairer than that stretched out his large brown palm and rosalie laid her cold it and the compact was concluded by a silent hand shake isaac who was a practical man pointed out to rosalie that her growing cold and remarked placidly that he would smoke a bit of by the fire while she partook of it she approached the table and began tremulously to fill her cup he a chair and sat down glanced round at him and started the new era had already begun was sitting in chair the prince blooming woods at twilight dim the throstle

from the woods which spoke of and the birds were making mysterious rustlings in the boughs preparing to go to roost young man paused every now and then to draw a long breath and round him with evident delight is good he said to himself once is place of magic then a sudden change came over his face and he added is better than is home was a pleasant looking young fellow with a handsome intelligent a tall well knit figure he had grey eyes very alert and keen expression and when he smiled his face lit up in an unexpected way his complexion was browner than might have been in connection with his hair which was not very dark and he had wideawake air as of one who had seen many men and things had almost reached the crest of the hill when his glance over the curving bank at the turn of the road rested figure amid the tangle of sunlit green and gold which would be rosalie fiander for some three it having been agreed between her and isaac that their not take place till her widowhood was on her

idly then with some interest the figure toiling up the hill feeling somewhat embarrassed when she its nearer approach that she was herself the object of a scrutiny the grey eyes which looked at her so intently from the brown face had a very peculiar mixture of expressions there in them and that she was there more a wonder an almost incredulous delight thus might look upon the face of a very dear friend whom he had not expected almost might he meet the sweetheart from whom he had been years he approached the bank he slackened his pace and presently came to immediately beneath pinnacle of moss

hastened along the crest of the bank came to the gig descended rapidly gathered up the reins into the vehicle that the stranger though he had begun to walk slowly on to watch her and being besides annoyed and confused at temporary embarrassment she jerked the reins somewhat sharply up nigger with the whip the astonished animal unaccustomed treatment started off at a brisk pace and the gig rattled down incline with a speed which would have filled its late owner disaster which he would certainly have prophesied was not long legs were not quite on a par with his mettle stumbling over a loose stone he was unable to and dropped fairly and squarely on both knees was up in an instant but rosalie jumping out of the cart to his head uttered a cry of anguish through the white dust which testified to misfortune she saw blood trickling moment later rapid footsteps were heard descending the hill and came to her assistance forward he carefully examined knees and then turned the curious expression which had so puzzled and annoyed completely vanished and given place to one of respectful concern be frightened he said is not skin there will be any marks has never been down before said she tearfully nigger fellow i should have driven you so fast down the hill legs should be attended to at once said the stranger practically you far to go miles to branston darted a keen glance at her he echoed am going there myself to morrow or rather going to a place about a mile this side of it i too stop a little this side of the town said rosalie nigger will never get so far what am i to do i must get night is a village a mile or so from here observed the young man your best plan would be to leave the horse at the inn there probably lend you another to take you home if you will get trap i will lead the horse slowly back no i will walk cried rosalie can lead him myself she like to take you out of your you bicycle i suppose you are going to dorchester can go to dorchester any time returned he is merely a fancy that takes me there a wish to see the old place again away from it for ten years but i am really on my way to visit if you know branston i dare say you have met him he lives village at a place called the down farm isaac sharpe ejaculated rosalie i do know him i door to him broke off not deeming it necessary to disclose on so short her peculiar relations with the person in question cried the young man gaily is strange our meeting like this am richard marshall his nephew you live next door to him you say added with a puzzled look you must am mrs fiander returned she remember elias fiander farm course i do and i used to know his wife you have been so long away that a great many changes have i was elias third wife cried he said rosalie blushing she knew not why dear husband july look of blank dismay which had overspread the young face to an expression of relief but he made no reply took hold of the nearest rein turned nigger round and began him slowly up the hill again can really manage quite well she said somewhat stiffly must see you out of your difficulties returned the other with and he too began to retrace his steps pausing a moment crest of the hill to repossess himself of his bicycle which he propped against the bank will ride on to the village he said make arrangements your horse there and getting a fresh one it will save time is none to spare if you want to get home before dusk raised his cap mounted and disappeared before rosalie had time she was glad enough of richard helpful company presently arrived at the black horse inn where in spite of poetical effusion which hung beneath the sign and which the merits of the establishment there was some difficulty accommodation and attention for poor nigger and even finding a substitute in fact the only animal available proved to huge rawboned three year old who was with great difficulty enter the shafts of the gig and who when harnessed tilted up in such a peculiar manner that rosalie shrank back in alarm does look safe she faltered quite sure that boy capable of driving him i have been shaken by the fright i suppose i feel quite unnerved will drive you said richard with decision waving aside the lad been appointed charioteer and who now began to assert his to perform the task guess i can manage most things in of horseflesh and in any case i intended to go to my morrow no i could rosalie was beginning when he eagerly will be easier i assure you my bag is here strapped on to i meant to take my uncle by does know i am you can send back the horse to if you took the lad would be difficult for him to return to night my bicycle can until i send for it or fetch it perhaps i had better get in first fiander to keep this wild animal quiet while you get up the reins it hold on by his head till the lady mounts that machine of mine in a dry place will you now then mrs give me your hand whoa boy steady there we go laid the whip lightly on the back and they were off had had time to protest or to demur long legs of the three year old covered the ground in a and with that tall masterful figure by her side she could feel indeed the sensation of swinging along through the brisk air enough though she felt a little uncomfortable at the thought astonishment which her arrival in such company would produce at home she was moreover not quite certain if she relished being taken possession of by the new comer rosalie was used and act for herself and it was quite a new experience to her her will gainsaid and her objections overborne even in her but after all the man was nephew and no one fault with her for accepting his assistance in a few would be his he would then allow her wishes to have she smiled to herself as she glanced up at would he she told him the relationship which he would shortly bear to her be her nephew how ridiculous it seemed he must be some than she was there were firm lines in that brown face and looked capable and strong as if they had accomplished plenty they reached yellowham hill once more and began to descend at pace richard broke silence have seen and done a good many things in the course of my travels have never come across so beautiful a spot as this and none of have been so curious as the one which introduced me to you said rosalie drily cannot see that there was anything extraordinary in it even if nigger had not had this accident have been certain to meet while you are staying at mr wonder said the young man speaking half to himself and half wonder if i should have preferred to meet you first in your a cornfield but the corn of course will not be ripe to come no on the whole i am content i said to myself when climbing the hill is magic in this place and i felt it know what you mean said rosalie can it matter first meets a new acquaintance and why should it be in a cornfield saw you first in a cornfield said he surely you were not in england last harvest time she cried you talking about you have only just said that you would like have met me first in a cornfield which is never seen me before have seen you before he murmured in a low voice nonsense she cried sharply must have dreamt it did you he owned glancing at her and once curious look of wondering joy stole over his face drew a little away from him in a displeasure which he was observe will explain some day he said looking down at her with a disarmed her and then having reached the bottom of the hill to the horse and they sped along once more at an and by he began to talk about his uncle speaking of him with affection that the heart of the future mrs sharpe warmed to him grateful regard for isaac had increased during their four indeed it could not have been otherwise he was so placid good natured and obliging moreover he took a lot of trouble hands for he had assumed the management of the farm their engagement no one could cavil at this arrangement it that the man who was so shortly to be master should at once the control of affairs even the gossips of the neighbourhood no ill natured comments one and all indeed agreeing that it behaviour on the part of the widow fiander to postpone the after the year was out rosalie listened well pleased while richard spoke of to him and his mother of the high esteem in which he and of his desire to spend a few weeks in his company before into the world afresh i ought to tell him that i am going to marry his uncle and then she dismissed the notion let isaac make himself she felt rather shy about possibly might not like the idea began to question him instead anent his past achievements prospects and heard with astonishment and concern that the had not only failed to make his fortune in the distant lands he but had come back in some ways poorer than he had set out in some things though he said reckon i am richer on are you poorer and how are you richer queried rosalie am poorer in pocket my uncle sent me out with a nice little sum me in life ah as i tell you a first rate old chap have done more for me if i had been his son well ago but i have come back richer all the in experience one thing i have seen a lot and learnt a lot i educated there in more ways than one dear old dorset holds a very fine the map of england yet is but a tiny corner of the world she listened there came to rosalie a sudden inexplicable envy never been out of her native had never wanted to its borders but for a moment the thought struck her that it a fine and desirable thing to see the world wonder she said tartly for her irritation at this on its unsuspicious wonder mr marshall you to come back to dorset since you have such a poor opinion of it did you settle out there where he inquired with a smile have tried to settle in a places i was in a newspaper office in new was while i that i did most in the way of educating then i went francisco and then to texas been pretty well over the states fact and been to mexico and brazil and canada i might well in several places if i could have made up my mind to stick job in i could something was drawing me all me back to me home so that at last i felt come back what will you do now she inquired with curiosity he cried drawing a deep breath must work on a farm the farm work is in my blood i believe i want the smell of turned earth i want my arms to be tired heaving the sheaves waggons i want to lead out the horses early in the morning into want oh many things considered him wonderingly these things were done around day as a matter of course but how curiously the man spoke of them unaccountable was that longing of which he spoke she had never the least like him and now that the conversation had from herself she felt a real pleasure and interest in listening talk as they drove onward through the gathering twilight she too moved to talk and was charmed by his quick understanding and her own wits were quick enough but she had fallen into of keeping her opinions on abstract subjects to herself was all that the people with whom she associated were capable and indeed they had not much to say on any matter at this young bright personality was something so absolutely new his point of view so original and vigorous and his sympathy that rosalie enjoyed her adventure as she had never in her life before her eyes shone her cheeks flushed laugh rang out she felt that she too was young hearted and that life and youth and gay companionship made a combination they drew near their destination a sudden silence fell between them presently richard broke it speaking in a soft and altered tone familiar the country grows even in the dark i recognise a every turn is not that your house yonder where the lights said rosalie with a little unconscious sigh cornfield where i saw you lies just to the right of it wish you would not talk in riddles said rosalie breathing through the dusk he could see the wrathful fire in her eyes not be angry he said quickly meant to tell you another i had come to know you better but after all why should i not now i saw a picture of you in london i stayed a day or two my way through from had some business to do for a new i went to the academy and there in the very first room saw your picture picture ejaculated she must have been the one that said he would paint it was yourself and you were lying in a cornfield under of wheat and the corner of your house could just be seen in and some of the men were reaping a little way you asleep heart was thumping in a most unusual way and her breath pantingly that she did not trust herself to speak was a big picture he said of sunshine and when i saw great field stretching away and the men working and old house in the distance and the girl sleeping so so glowing and yet so peaceful and homelike that my heart went it dorset i said and i believe i know i felt i could cry after all those years of wandering to find when myself all alone in a great strange city that piece of at tell you it made one feel queer remained silent angry with herself for the agitation which possession of her you see i was not quite so far wrong in saying that to a very strange one the first instant my eyes fell upon you you felt she must say something but her voice sounded husky and itself when she spoke certainly was odd that we should come across each other it would of course have been quite natural if you me when you came to your thought you would have been more interested in my story he after a pause am very much interested i think it a very funny story he repeated and then relapsed into silence which until they turned in at gate a thousand thorns and briers and i have in my poor breast yet can see that salve which my passion any rest herrick my boy i be main glad you be come back there no home be there isaac sharpe repeated these words for the twentieth time since arrival he beamed affectionately upon him through the of the bowl of punch specially brewed in his honour and then back in his chair sighed and shook his head be wonderful like your mother richard he said and sighed again groaned and took another sip of punch blinking the while the strength of the decoction and partly because he was overcome sitting opposite to him stretched out his legs luxuriously warmth of the crackling wood fire and removing his pipe from gazed contentedly round the familiar kitchen which was now best in the homely radiance is good to come back to the dear old place and to find the same as ever you seem to have grown a day older is changed i tell you how delightful that is had been tormenting myself during the journey with fancying i things thank heaven they are not glanced brightly at the broad rubicund face opposite to him and glass from the table health uncle may you live a thousand years and may you be at the end of them half emptied his glass and set it down with a cheery laugh drank slowly from his peering meanwhile at his nephew over you my lad he said replacing it on the table at last to you richard is kindly meant but changes he paused and richard is what must be in this here world colour always sufficiently ruddy was now so much heightened face assumed so curiously solemn an expression that richard his pipe half way to his lips and stared at him with amazement alarm the matter he said anxiously you feeling well looking first rate felt better in my life rejoined his uncle in sepulchral tones all right you quite frightened me what do you mean about changes took a gulp from his tumbler and fixed his round eyes dismally young man may be sich things as changes for the better he remarked his deepest bass believe in cried richard gaily tell me turn methody or salvationist or anything of that kind i like you i want you to be any better heart alive what notions the chap take in his head farmer relaxing into a smile now i never thought on but be a change in this here house for all that i be a isaac leaned forward with a hand on and fixed his eyes earnestly almost tragically on his a richard for to change my state slowly resumed an upright position drawing in his breath nostrils be a richard he continued observing the blank be a to get married me exclaimed richard taken aback for a moment then rising chair he stepped up to his uncle and slapped him heartily on done he cried done i give you joy upon my did think you had so much go in a splendid old chap said isaac without much enthusiasm glad it should i be against it returned richard hilariously surprised because i did think that was in your line but all in haste and repent at leisure the saying is the reverse you have taken your time about marrying so will be all the better for you hope so sure said the bridegroom elect dolefully adding still laughing resumed his seat thought best tell once as there was to be a change well a change for the better as you say cried the other be two to welcome me when i pay the down farm a visit one i shall find a jolly old aunt as well as a jolly old uncle took his pipe out of his mouth with a perturbed expression so very old he remarked course not neither are you for that matter may she be like yourself richard thank glad as you approve my matrimony the best thing going said richard still gaily an undercurrent of something curiously like tenderness is lessened by half and every joy is doubled always a face at the fireside always a kind true hand in to point out where the man has been at fault interrupted his uncle with a groan be enough to ready to comfort you when you are in trouble went on the without heeding him to advise you when you are in best of companions the most faithful of friends of a wife farmer was gazing across at him with bewilderment mixed with delight said richard well said ye be wonderful quick if the way ye feel about

so soon do you mean cried richard almost violently are about returned isaac raising his voice to a kind of mild roar been to me been a about mrs widow i be a to get married to she exclaimed his nephew in the same loud fierce tone bellowed farmer sharpe i been a ye this more did i say i were a to change my state and did a house of her own and wanted me to live over there her but your brains was wool lay a you your own young woman cried isaac with a roar stretching forward a long arm that he might give his nephew dig on the nearest available portion of his person laughed too spasmodically and with a wry face a sly dog uncle isaac he said a cunning got your wits about you if mine have gone astray yes very good taste picked out the greatest beauty your young woman eh put in isaac with a chuckle and my young woman of course agreed richard laughing again odd contortion of the face i have found her yet day is fixed for the end said his have to look out for your missus afore that time doubt as

so much as to farm work again and live on the old a wool it your thoughts off to the new missus not that to be expected returned his nephew idly his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands he gazing thoughtfully into the fire have got over my surprise at your piece of news yet he said a pause thought you so determined a bachelor i thought myself put in isaac with a nod what seen of mrs fiander i should never that she would be the wife you would choose when you did make mind to take one so inquired isaac somewhat roughly so years younger than you i should think nine corrected his uncle succinctly she is so full of life and spirit and dash i how you came to think of her was a pause during which isaac meditatively smoked and rubbed he said at last did exactly think of it myself i could someways find it in my heart to say no say what cried the young man dropping his hands and whisking his chair gazed at him mildly and continued to polish his corduroys say no he repeated slightly uplifting his voice and speaking and distinctly say i could find it my she axed me asked you do you mean to say that the proposal came from her uncle nodded war very likely it come me he i told her at the time i never was a silence ensued during which richard vainly endeavoured to readjust at length he said faintly what did she say to that said returned farmer sharpe stolidly it would be a for is a fine farm says she a good business easy work the two farms together says she gazed at his uncle with starting eyes and a dropping jaw why in the name of fortune he ejaculated could marrying why you knowed work the farm right ye see things was round and she knowed i understood the work ah i told her the time that she ought to look out for a younger man but she says want no counter jumpers says the branston folks there were a good few after her but she did fancy none them thought some was arter the money and none them knowed dairy fact struck in richard rising from his chair and beginning to about the room has proved herself to be a most you make away with her allow the business so agreed his uncle sucking vigorously at his pipe continued to walk about the room and presently paused hearth she make an offer to elias fiander too he inquired sharply removed his pipe and stared up at him the idea was to him for the first time never telled me so he said were made up in a hurry to had no notion sich a thing when he started off he went arter a turnip hoer arter her death they up poor old chap and mrs nowhere remarked richard sardonically i think pursued the farmer averting his eyes from his and gazing stolidly at the think as axed her now i can mind he told me so at the time a wife says he her such a good hand at the dairy work make sure her he says told him i suppose that she was a good hand at dairy work marshall i understand the matter now she is as a practical woman is agreed farmer sharpe warmly be a wonderful the time said that ah i reckon i can say murmured something inarticulate and returned to his chair lighting his pipe and beginning to smoke without further remark opposite side of the hearth isaac ruminated contentedly to notice his preoccupation and tumblers and emptied in almost unbroken silence richard sought his room that familiar little attic had been his in first act after a cursory glance and approval was to set down his candle on the little and to draw carefully from his pocket a large envelope he took out a print evidently cut from some illustrated paper of of the year holding it close to the light at it intently underneath were the words sleeping beauty by the name the picture represented a cornfield large of sheaves to the front beneath which lay figure of a girl asleep even in this rough reproduction likeness to rosalie was discernible and fancy rest indeed as he gazed he contemplated not only the glowing finished work of art which had haunted him persistently since first beheld it but the vision of that exquisite face lithe graceful form which had suddenly appeared to him against of bloom and sunlit green he seemed to hear again the voice which had thrilled him as it prattled at his side he see the large eyes lifted a little shyly to his and then because of his too evident admiration had deemed these things the outward indication of absolute his young imagination fired by the unexpected meeting and further stimulated by his chance remarks a marvellous romance before isaac had pronounced the name of future bride now the golden glow had vanished all was flat and grey and what was worse he knew his ideal to have young bloom and beauty and fascination meant was a calculating mercenary woman devoid even of not content with her phrase the she considered best likely to protect her interests she offered herself to him haggled over the prospective bargain with him the gains which must accrue to both when she more than a child she had angled for old elias fiander well homeless and penniless then and might from her extreme youth to know no better but now in the ripeness of her womanhood wealth liberty all that she could desire at her command she sell herself again pah such a nature must positively an impetuous movement he held the paper over the candle but snatched it away again extinguishing the flame with his thumb and rubbing the burnt edge ruefully at least is a thing of beauty he said destroy it hastily restoring the print to its wrapper and thrusting it pocket again he muttered wish i had never seen her butter rolls cream why bowls william barnes come come away or let me go must i here stay troth lady no herrick was somewhat disappointed at his lack of enthusiasm over which had at first seemed to take his fancy so much talk as about future and his own desire that he should pass of his days on the down farm he could extract nothing from man but vague expressions of gratitude and a doubtful promise the matter over up yonder to remarked isaac after breakfast a little matter there as i must see to ye mid as well step me richard was thinking of taking a stroll round this place rejoined richard all your hurry ye may as well wait till i am ready to ye not be above two or three minutes at littlecomb and mid walk round together besides be to pay to mrs fiander ye arter her from her to be your aunt be sure i must keep on good terms with my aunt must i she make me welcome when i come to see you fear make welcome enough she civil and respectful to i in time ah sure that she be pleased at my calling so early dear heart alive you know that woman richard soon arter four in the morning and she has her maids afoot aye and the men knows if they comes late get fined ah be a wonderful manager what in the name of wonder said richard to himself as the portly white figure across the yard and over the the name of wonder can she want with you farmer protest most people would have considered at which they betook themselves to call at littlecomb farm early one the dew lay thick and sparkling upon the of the downs and the air was still sharp and keen a lark over their heads its jubilant notes piercing an odd sense of pain what was this heaviness which had come and which even the brisk walk through the exhilarating air and familiar scents and sounds and sights could not they had entered demesne these wide fields were hers were her cattle grazing by the river and here peeping trees and compassed about by a goodly array of stacks was her its bodyguard of farm buildings who had not spoken much throughout the walk became as he crossed the well kept yard and even lagged behind when approached the open milkhouse door through this open door of female voices could be heard raised one in voluble excuse whose tone richard recognised with a little shiver anguish in vituperation but isaac sharpe boldly the building and beckoned to him to follow the matter here he inquired good humouredly mrs f brought my nevvy to see ye find us rather in a mess afraid returned still with a distinct note of sharpness in it i am very has come i want to thank him for his kindness to me yesterday over his uncle richard descried the mistress of the over the large cheese vat already alluded to one white arm almost to the shoulder vigorously kneading and stirring a huge curds her buff print dress appeared to imprison the sunshine and movement alike showed off her supple figure to the very lovers thought the young man would have been unable to resist of putting an arm about that inviting waist for the arm of the future husband had surely a right to be there isaac sharpe stood bluff and square in the doorway his hands in his hat on his head excuse my shaking hands said rosalie looking up with eyes the angry light still lingered and a puckered brow upset and i leave the curds for a minute indeed as it is the whole of this batch will be good for nothing hitherto imperceptible dimple peeped out near her lips when red ripe lips such a bewitching dimple isaac however thrust his hands a little deeper into his pockets and with increased concern wrong morning i happened to be late said rosalie uplifting her voice for the benefit of the culprit jane who had suddenly tears a fact which was betrayed by her heaving shoulders as with her back to the visitors happened to be a little late repeated rosalie severely one of the jane sniffed start me and when i came down what do you think i actually careless girl pouring the rennet in out of the bottle tch tch commented the farmer clicking his were but a few spoonfuls left explained jane could you possibly tell how many were left retorted her mistress increased acerbity know how particular i always am to out drop for drop spoonful too much may make all at this time of year i call it downright you to run the risk of spoiling the whole vat ful there are and fifty gallons of milk in this should make nearly of cheese and just because you are so idle and may all go to waste turned her pretty tear bedabbled face over her shoulder and incoherently protested that she always did her best with a gasp and a moan she darted past the group in the ran round the house looked after her with a disgusted air and then his to mrs fiander whose beautiful round arm was still embedded and whose face a little paler than its wont continued to be ire what could this trifling mistake matter after all to such a a woman who would soon be richer still besides blooded and self interested she was evidently miserly she was distinctly bad tempered his imagination already warped revulsion of feeling consequent on his disclosures was take alarm at every trivial detail pallor and drawn look on her due in reality to a sleepless night from an unaccountable perturbation of to an acute and unreasonable disappointment over money loss the eyes which had gazed on rosalie yesterday were now busily tracing lines of fancied meanness face those frowning brows surely revealed the shrew the spoke of parsimony when that lovely colour faded and cut features had become coarsened by age and self imposed toil would remain none of that beauty of soul which he had thought there well remarked isaac placidly accidents will happen would advise to be cast down by these here curds be a all right i know how is young folks a body stand over them all the time why when we be a i go in for a bit o dinner for fear them poor ewes pieces when i come back jerked the mass of curds up with additional impetuosity but reply nevvy pursued isaac like to drop in pay to my dear inquire how you was a arter yesterday he nudged richard as a tacit reproach for his muteness hope said the young man formally you are none the worse shock mrs fiander blue eyes shot up an inquiring glance and the industrious arm a moment what was the meaning of this altered tone and why was now bent on her fraught with such cold disapproval they had old friends and she had looked forward more than she knew to meeting you she returned in a tone almost as frigid as own nerves are not easily upset believed the statement to be true yet the equilibrium of her at that moment if she had but realised it very seriously disturbed sent for nigger mrs f inquired isaac sent james bundy to look after him he may not be fit to move for or two he were a good beast remarked the farmer is a pity ye did slip was fast down hill my nevvy here tell me what never been used to ye should have druv my dear thought of the cause of her unusual haste on the previous day her anxiety to escape from the too evident admiration of the which were now bent on her with so different an expression confused her the contrast stung her she answered sharply assumed indifference cannot crawl down every slope to suit the convenience of a worn worn out though returned her future husband who things literally i should say last a good few though he be past work used gentle how far go both with man beast soft far in a day the goes fair is trew bent her head over the vat in silence her face averted so visitors could see only the outline of her cheek the of ear and neck and soft muttered richard to himself and soft enough at but her heart is as the nether millstone uncle gazed reproachfully at him he was proud of his travelled learned nephew and had eagerly looked forward to the impression sure to produce on f who had also been highly educated considered an authority on matters appertaining to he showing off at all he was standing there mum chance as stupid other body might be he gave him another admonitory nudge my nevvy did quite take me by surprise last night to see at all to tell the trewth i had no kind where he mid be he had long were it a wrote me last richard inquired isaac driving home the his elbow and again frowning and winking know answered his nephew in muffled tones long time but you see you never wrote to me he added with a laugh be different my boy returned the farmer seriously why i did write richard i never was a man lard here he relaxed and uttered a jolly laugh is as much as do to put my name to a receipt then bithey do it for i and jist stick my mark under it nay richard i never was one i was continued to roll his shoulders and to chuckle meditatively but his eyes were meanwhile fixed appealingly upon the face who remained obstinately dumb their hostess came to his assistance suppose now that you are here remain some time mr she asked without looking round her voice in nearly as muffled as the young own as she bent over depends mrs fiander of course i want to see as much as i can uncle but restless by nature i never stay very long place now cried isaac in loud remonstrance ye be at be ye did we arguefy enough about it last night no so i tell a comed home and now ye may bide lard i did think ye could be sich a voolish chap what ye to go the world when ye have a good berth offered ye them been your friends ready anxious to keep ye mrs f will tell the same as i do my dear quite understand what it is all about said rosalie pausing labours however and straightening herself is this way explained the farmer richard come he says to me says he been a longing for years years back to the wold place now says he feel as if i settle to naught but the old work farm work he says then here house be empty afore very long moreover says i need to have somebody responsible to look after this place for to reason mrs f as i be in two places at one time endorsed this statement with an inarticulate murmur and then says i you want to come back to the wold place up the farm work why not live here and work for i not indeed said rosalie what i say said the farmer indignantly not first quite took the notion but arter a bit he did seem to now i want to know pursued isaac extending an relish it richard you should be disappointed in i should give said richard hesitatingly nonsense let know fast enough if ye have i brought up he much same as a i i should find i could settle then be more if i had given in to the plan why should settle what i want to know ax that f ax why he should settle travelled enough indeed said rosalie should think you ought to be glad of quiet mr marshall said cried isaac be a fool if he lets my repeated rosalie gazing in surprise from the heated countenance of the elder man to the inscrutable one of i think mr marshall would be very unwise if he did it it seems to me entirely to his advantage of course said richard with a momentary gleam in his steel course my personal advantage should outweigh every it is obvious nothing like a clear head a

every bank prick long green to hear the cuckoo cries elinor sweetman to gather flowers sappho went and homeward she did bring within her lawny continent the treasure of the spring herrick marshall drove the plough slowly up the brown slope half the summit halted and having established his horses at angle sat down with his back against a tall mossy by a little copse to eat his breakfast had already partaken of a shortly after dawn but two exercise in the brisk morning air had whetted his and he now fell to work on his bread and bacon with the and relish great field all glittering green save for the brown strip to recent labours stretched away for many goodly acres on slope beneath he could see the roofs of littlecomb farm and but the sight of the amber and ruddy outlines awakened now no feeling of repulsion during the past weeks he had out of his whilom fancy for the fascinating and he had even taken himself to task somewhat severely for on that unconscious young woman was it her fault after all her outer parts belied her real self why had he been angry because she had failed to correspond to the which he had formed on slight and inadequate premises she very beautiful creature and no doubt good enough in her way if common place and had a sharp eye for the main chance she would better wife to a practical farmer he would in all probability well enough with her when she became his aunt but meanwhile life full of congenial work and ever growing interest to admit of time in improving his acquaintance with the future mrs sharpe had thrown himself into his new pursuits with characteristic energy found them daily more and more engrossing he possessed a gift to be met with in the cultivator of the love of nature own sympathy with her moods not from the practical but poetical standpoint clouds and sunlight frosts and dew meant him than to his brother toiler the very odour of the damp earth of the bursting buds in copse and hedgerow of the beneath his feet intoxicated him the homely thud of hoofs as they trod the furrow the ripping up of the green sod drove the plough through it the mere consciousness of his own life and manhood dominating this solitude filled him with a kind is what i want he had said to himself over and that morning is what i have always wanted had finished his breakfast now but he permitted himself the luxury for a few moments longer he threw himself back on the bank resting on his clasped hands and his eyes gazing up up interlacing boughs of the trees outlined now with shifting silver morning light through the ethereal leafage still half unfolded the heights of delicate blue beyond he had fancied that there much breeze this morning yet as he lay thus quiet he could hear rustling in the undergrowth and the occasional crackling squirrel perhaps but when was a wood known to be besides the incidental noises attending the passage of running creaking and swaying of boughs of leaves had not such places a mysterious movement of their own was there not always a stir a whisper in produced by no ostensible cause upwards his head still pillowed on his hands richard on some half forgotten page of thoreau which seemed to this fancy of his when suddenly a figure appeared on of the bank close to him and without warning sprang down rosalie fiander with the skirt of her print gown gathered up so form a receptacle for the mass of primroses which she had and the fragrance of which was now wafted to fiander with minute dewdrops clinging to her dark hair morning roses on her cheeks and the morning light shining in vision of grace and beauty more captivating even than the rosalie of the cornfield or the stately heroine of sat up the colour rushing over his sunburnt face he himself of hat and coat his waistcoat hung loosely open shirt was unfastened at the throat for a moment rosalie did him then as he slowly rose to his feet she too blushed beg your pardon i did not know anyone was here i had a half hour before breakfast and ran out to pick some primroses this is you know she added hastily am not trespassing unless when a short cut home across your field richard with his bare brown arms and ruffled head was not alarming she scarcely recognised in him the trim severe young had called on her ceremoniously a few weeks before still less personage who had driven her home from dorchester who such strange things and looked at her so was just like anybody else after all being blithe of heart spring morning she smiled on him pleasantly and lowering of her gown displayed the primroses they not lovely i like them better than any other fact love them almost the first thing that i can remember is holding on finger while she took me up to a bank of primroses when i grew old enough to pick them for myself oh each spring of finding the first primrose curiously enough the gay tone and easy manner had the effect richard with wrath the very grace of her attitude like candour of her eyes were to him obnoxious the more so could not repress a momentary thrill of admiration he knew how were worth he knew the sordid nature beneath this are fine things he said with assumed carelessness have picked some before the nineteenth then you would have had sale for them i want to sell them cried she her white teeth flashing she laughed and the dimples coming and going picked them shall fill every vase in the house primroses should never those you see in the streets look so miserable all with their dear little faces crushed and faded and even gone it seems a sin to sell primroses particularly as i suppose they fetch a big price in had gathered up a bunch in one hand and now raised it to her are like satin she said the gesture and the smile which accompanied it provoked endurance are pretty little yellow things he said not worth of practical people there are other yellow things of of beautiful fresh butter for instance round cheeses beauty of these is that they can be exchanged finer yellow coin mrs fiander that is the thing really worth thinking about you so fond of money she asked innocently and once more she dew drenched flowers caressingly against her cheek how could so guileless how had she the face to turn the tables on him thus all how dared she be so beautiful he had almost succeeded his transitory hallucination he wanted to ignore here she was tantalising him afresh we not all fond of money he said with a forced laugh fond of money i queried she and the blue eyes glanced up with of course you are all fond of it i say we men toil we sell our brains for sell our strength and power and years of our lives for it and you paused rosalie surprised at his vehemence but still half amused lightly what do we do take care of it when got it and do when we have always he added and this time there was no mistaking insolence of his tone a woman sells herself has got it and sometimes mistrusting her own powers she invites other people to take care of it for her was a dead silence for a moment richard fixing his upon her face saw the colour ebb from it leaving the very his shot had struck was glad of it do you mean said rosalie at last lifting her eyes which she lowered and looking at him steadily think you must know what i mean he returned with a smile in its contemptuousness should you attack me she inquired without flinching though eyes looked pathetic in their surprise and pain i attacking you i am merely stating facts when a penniless marries a prosperous old man one is bound to conclude that his the chief attraction and when that same girl finding herself a later rich and free offers herself for the second time to a years older than herself cried rosalie turning upon him fiercely while returned impetuously to her face dare you say such thing to me it not true he inquired have the statement on most dropped her flower laden skirt a yellow shower falling at and buried her face in her hands she groaned told you that how could he beautiful shoulders heaved tears trickled through her fingers steeled his heart against her let her her cry selfish tears could not expiate the things that she had done and subterfuges were natural weapons but they should her she should be made to realise her own vileness you deny it he said sternly dropped her hands and raised her head her lip was but her eyes shone through the tears deny nothing she said and without another word walked away down the slope and across the field passing through a gate at end stood looking after her until she was out of sight then his to the heap of primroses lying at his tumbled heap and dewy and as they had fallen from her gown he stooped and began to gather them together but threw back again the flowers he had picked up should i do with them he murmured half aloud he passed his hand across his brow and looked round him with stare have i done he said colin the grass was grey and wet the which i heard her velvet footfall come but heaven where yet no pallid crescent rode flowered in fire behind the bloomless plum there stirred no wing nor wind the wood was dumb only blown roses shook their leaves on stems more tender than an soft leaves soft hued and curled like and each dim tree shed sweetness over me from honey dews that breathless boughs let in the orchard by the sea elinor sweetman sich very good company to night richard remarked mr laying down his knife and fork and gazing critically at i say as ye be you have opened your we sat down except just to put a bit into it now and again too often neither ye nothing to speak on ye a word to throw to a dog amiss returned richard rousing himself with a startled the brown study into which he had fallen suppose i am tired added as an afterthought very like ye be agreed the farmer commiseratingly on what a used to how soon he gets knocked up you be town and that and when you come back to it tries you a bit to start is just the other way used to the country ye see and when i do have to go dorchester or weymouth or any big place like i mortal tired them streets now and in at heart alive it makes me so weary as i could very down in the middle of as for in trains do make me so stiff i can scarce lay legs to the ground do from but i dare say you found it a hardish bit up the big field yonder nephew made no response and isaac bawled out the question afresh young man who had been absently balancing a fork on his fore finger and replied hastily that he had found it at all perhaps rather hard but very pleasant and he liked the work took a farewell pull at his pint mug set it down and pushed away up to the fire lad he said smoke your pipe quick and fit for but bed no returned richard hastily as he rose could not go to is not much past eight i think sit down by go out for a stroll to stretch my legs your legs commented his uncle indignantly them enough to day already a worked hard enough men remedy so good as a hair of the dog that bit you you know brisk turn will take the stiffness off and it is a how restless these young chaps do be ejaculated isaac as his chair across the tiled floor to the hearth body mid be glad enough to set down for a bit engage find enough to turn out to morrow morn richard had proceeded a little way he paused and drew a then wheeling round swiftly began to retrace his steps to a stand still for the second time his hands clenched fixed finally crying aloud will do must do it once more and pursued his former course sun had set some time before but the heavens were still luminous rosy glow which lingered at the horizon merging into soft primrose in its turn melted into an exquisite ethereal green against background the hills and woods stood out darkly purple while copses scattered here and there upon the downs and the hedge further end appeared to be almost black little parties of sheep scurried out of way a bell tinkling here among them birds flew almost into his face as he passed the trees before alluded to when he forced his way through the hedge tendril of honeysuckle wet with the heavy dew flapped face every now and then a rabbit crossed his path its noticeable in the dusk save for the flash of its little there must have been thyme growing on or about those downs fragrance was strong in the air richard did not however pause is even doubtful if he noticed it yet when by and fields he skirted a bank overgrown with primroses perfume for a moment turned him almost faint was the house at quiet at this hour nothing seemed to no one was about appeared in answer to a somewhat tremulous knock and informed her mistress was in the garden soon call her she added no he returned quickly will go to only want to see a moment knew she might refuse to obey the summons it was best to come without warning to the left explained susan path leads you up to her directions and passing through the little wicket found himself in the walled enclosure which had once been house garden for littlecomb had been the dower house of a along the straight prim paths stately ladies had loved to pace the lavender hedge which was pride had been the pride a titled dame before her it was more of a pleasant wilderness garden now having been neglected by elias and his predecessors on but rosalie was endeavouring to reclaim it and already had with the work richard walking slowly onward down the dim alleys and peered into various overgrown bowers length amid a mass of distant greenery he descried a moving figure quickening his pace advanced towards it the afterglow had faded and the moon had not yet risen here beneath these and amid this dense growth everything looked shadowy and unreal would scarcely have distinguished which was path and which border had he not been guided towards the spot where she stood double line of white pinks now a blossom laden apple bough barred now he passed beneath an arch of monthly roses brushing moisture from leaf and bloom as he went at once voice called through the dusk that you susan come here for a moment i want you to hold made no reply but hastened on the shadowy figure turned saw the pale silhouette of her face she was standing beneath a laden with white blossoms which from their size and perfume to be lilac she had drawn down a branch and was endeavouring one of the clustering blooms is it she said quickly is i he returned loosed the branch which flew rustling up to join its fellows a step forward he could see her face more clearly now the gleam white teeth between her parted lips he even fancied that he an angry sparkle in her eyes do you come here she said at least i supposed came replied richard in an unsteady voice beg your pardon most sincerely for my conduct to you to day was inexcusable she said after a pause it seemed to him that breathing with a just and natural anger do not attempt to excuse it he murmured cannot even understand it she pursued had i done to you do my private concerns affect you was a long silence and then richard said almost in a whisper can make no think i must have been mad when i came i if i could kill myself for my brutality to you all shame of it has been eating into my feel branded disgraced cannot rest until you tell me you have forgiven me was silence again broken only by the faint warbling of a to his mate in the warm dusk ask a great deal said rosalie at last scarcely know how i you saw the dark figure sway a little but he spoke quietly can only say that i would give my life to recall those insulting mine she repeated count for little that you should me you should judge me so harshly said nothing the thrush sang on the liquid notes rising and almost unendurable sweetness entreat you he pleaded once more entreat you to stretched out her hand in silence and he took it without a word cold very cold and it trembled drew it away almost as soon as his fingers had closed upon it and and went away his footsteps falling with unaccustomed the little path and presently the gate swung to behind him was sitting by the dying fire a foot resting on either hob by a haze of tobacco smoke when his nephew entered towards richard with an aggrieved expression as he crossed them there legs yourn should be pretty well stretched by now was whether you were back at all to night where been all this while hesitated and then throwing back his head been to see mrs fiander to littlecomb at this time night what ever took there to tell you the truth i went to make an apology to mrs fiander came across the top field to day when i was ploughing and i which hurt her fact i offended her very much felt i could not rest to night without begging her pardon said the farmer and then paused eyes and mouth round concern he continued presently glad as very glad as ye richard that well done of but what did you go for to offend her for leaned forward anxious wrinkles still furrowing his brow up his mouth as though he was going to whistle by and by he did actually whistle under his breath and without any tune richard meanwhile stood looking down into the fire as had not heard the question hinted his uncle at last i beg your pardon i think sure how i came to so i was out of temper i suppose commented the farmer i can say truly as she and me had a word not since i knowed her nay not so much as one word did get on wonderful well in time and now i do as we gets on better than ever you ought to said richard a trifle irritably then he added in tone believe anyone could quarrel with you ye see explained isaac waving his pipe impressively i was a quarrelsome i never should ax to she oncommon fond mrs f this richard made no rejoinder stretching out his foot he pushed together and then stood looking down at them again sorry richard as ye should hurt her feelings went on after ruminating for some time in evident distress of mind be very sorry for that but ye could do no more nor nay could do more nor that glad ye did richard am i said richard huskily adding with the same irritation had previously displayed that it makes much difference one the other is a bad thing went on the farmer to hurt a the beginning of acquaintance it makes a bad start ye see it up notions as maybe never thought on if they was in the beginning now my poor grandmother did have sich tender there was no in her and my heard tell the tale many did always set it down to his not been careful to keep side her when they was a this way ye see father was a bit of a buck in his day up to the time had his banns put up my mother he liked to have his fling walk one sunday one maid and the next maybe another and the third maybe go a and poor mother her best bonnet on all the time a out for anxious and she got that upset in her and that nervous that she was the better for it all her life after ah my father say often when scratched his face for him his hat into the wash tub is my own fault he say use to consider her as a young and her agen me now shook his head slowly over this affecting reminiscence his pipe to its favourite corner richard said nothing for but presently turned towards his uncle with a smile you be afraid uncle isaac mrs temper is perfect sure i was entirely in fault to day and i will promise not to do anything which might disturb your peace of mind he spoke with assumed lightness there was an earnest look in some friendship is feigning most loving mere folly then heigh ho the holly this life is most jolly shakespeare sunday came round isaac sharpe surprised his nephew by inviting accompany him on his usual visit to littlecomb think you want me said richard colouring and hesitating only be in the way two are company and three are none now is a silly notion that more the merrier i say i have particular reasons for wanting you to come to day mrs f have met since that night as ye have ye said richard i noticed you hung behind when i was to her arter was ashamed her about it said richard but that will never do if ye go on a back and a her way things will get and a tween ye now my advice and come along i quite quiet and off so easy as ye could wish just drop in same as myself i to be friends i refuse if you put it like that said marshall and sallied forth together spite of mr prognostication there was decidedly a about the young meeting rosalie greeted stiffly and invited him with formal politeness to take a seat is a fine day began isaac as he installed himself in backed elbow chair which had now become his by consecrated right responded hastily that it was a very fine day remarked the farmer with a covert note of warning in his voice nevvy was a as we come along that it was a wonderful fine the time richard it happened to be the time of year when fine days were not uncommon alleged observation would not have testified to any on part but as a matter of fact it was nevertheless the young man did not repudiate it he said with his eyes on the floor to be sure find it oncommon warm in church mrs f pursued mr after a short silence i did agreed she was longing for someone to open the door f say cried isaac turning to his nephew with an which was intended to stimulate him to further efforts f say richard as she found it oncommon warm eyes travelled slowly from the carpet to his face they rested for the life of him he could not muster courage them to the blooming face on the other side he commented faintly she said isaac emphatically ax here he jerked significantly in direction say as she as somebody open the my dear indeed said rosalie tell about that richard went on isaac and boot came slowly sliding across the floor till it foot which it proceeded to kick in an admonitory fashion ax her about known she was the door opened it fast enough for mrs f would richard responded marshall with his eyes still glued on his you can jist talk about that hinted the latter as he proceeded in his pocket for his pipe dead silence ensued isaac looked from one to the other and stood upon his brow his strenuous efforts had but the desired consummation seemed just as far off as ever you got your tobacco box uncle isaac inquired the dutiful me give you a light said rosalie they were again what was the good of their talking to him them to talk to each other said isaac after sucking for a moment at his applied the match a flash of inspiration had come my boy ye have been round this here farm since ye have said richard i know it well of old but been improvement since ye been a better take him round mrs f and show him been done the last few years he be oncommon fond just suit it richard stammered confusedly that he should like it of all things you be a wonderful one for fresh air yourself mrs f went on take out and show everything a had risen willingly enough for she had found the exceedingly uncomfortable but she now paused hesitatingly you coming mr sharpe my dear stay where i be is very comfortable here corner and i so young as i was ye see nay you folks can go out and freshen yourselves up a bit and and the wold man will bide at home and smoke his pipe ready for tea when you come back nodded at them both with an air of finality and twisted round so as to present to their gaze a large and inflexible back then we had better start if we are to be back by tea time a little sharply and richard took up his hat and followed in silence whole place was wrapped in sabbath stillness milking was over and line of red and dappled cows was vanishing down the lane by one or two of the dairy with white their sunday clothes save for the calves which thrust moist noses through the bars of their enclosure and the lazily as they lay sunning themselves in the angle of the barn barton was absolutely deserted drained the big mead four years ago said rosalie threw acre into it is beautiful pasture now would you like to hurriedly expressed a desire to that effect and the two in silence along a narrow farm track to the rear of the house led to the field in question they walked with the breadth of between them and in unbroken silence their eyes by common accord straight in front and both secretly rebelling against which isaac had deemed so happily devised at length they a gate set in the hedge and turned to look over it a great stretched away before their gaze meeting the sky line on where it sloped upwards and melting on the other into the lighter delicate green of springing corn beyond were the woods which as the low line of hills behind them were covered by a gentle haze leaned his elbows on the topmost rail of the gate and his cleared as his eyes roamed over the landscape county of dorset has given birth to more than one great writer origin whose early nurture amid field and heath and woodland an intimate and loving sympathy with nature to which each has given exquisite expression richard marshall born of the peasant stock brought up amid the same pastoral surroundings a somewhat kindred spirit though he was denied this gift yet the inglorious rustic milton was not always mute he so much and meditated so much and above all felt so deeply times something of what he thought and felt struggled to his lips vent in words inadequate indeed but suggestive beautiful it all is he said turning to rosalie with a rapture in his eyes seems to fill one like music i suppose you have seen far finer sights during your travels she speaking naturally for the first time as she too the gate things oh yes perhaps but this homely beauty touches me as sight could do something about a great sketch of green like affects me curiously i love these wide fields i remember your saying so said rosalie the ice was broken she could talk to him freely even taking courage to broach a had much occupied her thoughts lately told me you know you were at the sight of the cornfield my picture did not turn towards her and continued to scan the mead but over face she saw the colour rush quickly yes he said course i remember telling you about it wanted to ask you the picture a very large one and was painted very large indeed and beautifully painted there was an in front of it because people pressed round it so i was told the picture of the year it cried rosalie and at the note of delight in her voice and looked at her with a smile her cheeks were pink her eyes shining she cried with a sigh of longing would give anything to see it have a little print of it here returned he impulsively cut of a paper it will give you some idea of it though of course poor one another moment he partly withdrew from its enclosure the print holding the envelope firmly in his own hand however so charred margin was hidden he said pointing with his disengaged hand is there in the corner and here are your men and here piled up sheaves are you but of course the figure in the far more like you see said rosalie it must be a nice picture and you say beautifully done is beautifully done it is so real so vivid that i felt as if walk into the picture these sheaves stand out so that one it easy to pass behind them glanced up as he said these words and was surprised to see almost to the temples his own heart gave a sudden throb was that she had divined the audacious thought which had so to him as he recalled that picture and which since his he had resolutely striven to banish a matter of fact there did happen to be a certain similarity thought of his and that which had caused rosalie to change colour there had flashed across her mind the remembrance of the words if i come across a very attractive specimen of i may place him just behind the stook is the name underneath i suppose she said hastily is called i cannot see from here is called sleeping beauty returned richard was dumb for a moment hot waves of colour rushing over brow what was it the man had said last year will wake up my beauty words of ill omen they had often tantalised her but now as they recurred to her her heart seemed still ashamed of her burning face on which the young now fixed and of the agitation which she could not master bent forward confusedly is the name of the painter let me look richard could divine her intention she had snatched the print hand its black and jagged edges immediately catching her eye she said in an altered it is burnt was now turn to look confused began to burn it of my intention wanted to burn it said rosalie you were so angry why were you so angry with me was it because what your you know he did not mean to do me harm said rosalie tremulously think can have made you understand properly everything wrong i was so much bothered i found i could not myself and he had been my poor was beginning i knew i could trust him not to do anything elias would liked it is so difficult to explain do not try to explain said richard very gently you should misjudge me as you do cried she and then tears do not misjudge you now said richard in a low voice i assure you i understand you have been quite along big tearful blue eyes looked at him over the crumpled handkerchief you said i sold myself she gasped should that i loved my husband am sure you did said richard gravely and tenderly indeed i did i loved him from the first he was like a father yes said richard and he looked at her with an odd mixture and compassion was just as kind and dotingly fond of me as my own dear granfer be sure said richard no wonder you loved him in his tone caused rosalie to pull down her handkerchief and a keen glance at him do you look at me like that she said passionately i looking at you in any particular way returned he averting quickly you were you were looking at me as if you were sorry for me you be sorry for me you not telling me he said quietly much you felt the your good old husband know it was not that she retorted looked at me as if i child who had no if i did not know what i was saying i said richard beg your pardon that what you really think of me pursued she her eyes full fire though the tears were still standing on her cheeks insist on your answering me gaze had been fixed on the little print which she was holding rosalie marking this had felt an increase of indignation did to share the opinion which the artist had so rousing himself however he turned towards her and met do think he said you know very little of life perhaps it the better for you the fruit of the tree of knowledge is sometimes it is poisonous was about to make a very angry rejoinder when the sound of to them made them both suddenly start on looking round they loving couple such as are so frequently to be met with in on sunday afternoons sauntering down the lane hastily restored her handkerchief to her pocket and again the gate endeavouring to assume a careless attitude but she much annoyed for the young man who was so gallantly escorting befringed and beribboned lady was no other than sam belbin at time she would have been somewhat amused on discovering how lowly admirer had consoled himself he was working at branston now his companion was evidently a townswoman but that he should come just then in the midst of her tears and wrath with richard such close proximity was most vexatious stared hard as he approached taking in as rosalie felt though not again look towards him every compromising detail of when they had passed on he made some facetious remark to on whose arm he was hanging to which she responded by little incident impressed rosalie disagreeably she turned to holding out the little print which had been the cause of agitation had better finish burning this she said i had returned he with unexpected docility looked so placid and cheery when they entered and greeted so bright a smile that rosalie was conscious of a sudden rush up to him she placed her hand upon his shoulder a caress its recipient mightily for he was not accustomed from her rosalie kept her hand there however at richard the while as though to say are wrong me so ignorant see how i love and appreciate this good man richard smiled back kindly as if replying see it indeed and glad that you are content said isaac squinting down sideways at hand f did you take all over the place took mr marshall to see the big mead returned she a sure he thought that improved well and then you took see the root crop we did go there we did like to go too far as you by yourself i were all right here isaac slowly lifted the shoulder on hand still lingered and again glanced down at it as hint she withdrew it he gently rubbed the place where it took down to the carnfield though he continued thought them oats was a on wonderful they had not been to the cornfield it appeared nor yet to see nor round by the vegetable garden nor through the orchard had just been to the big mead and back commented mr sharpe gazing at them in amazement must oncommon slow stood for some time looking at the view said richard somewhat confounded at the view eh echoed his uncle any view on from the mead if gone a bit further up the lane the corner had a beautiful view branston but if yourselves all right wheeled round in his chair as he made this last remark and one to the other of the young folks both faces were and somewhat paler than usual after a scrutiny as crestfallen as they long as you yourselves he repeated slowly long a made want to be friends ye see and richard glanced at each other he read in her face a kind mingled with fear and dropped his eyes quickly lest betray the anguish and longing with which his heart was full want to be friends ye see repeated the farmer anxiously me and you mrs f as friendly as can be you and me much the a son to me then you and mrs f why should be her to whom the question was directed remained dumb friends they ever be friends however made a step forward and extended her hand should we not indeed she said tell you the truth isaac done nothing but quarrel since we first met each other which silly and unreasonable of us now for your sake i am to quarrel any more and for your sake i think he too should to keep the peace said cried isaac heartily said mrs f now richard boy your hand just catch hold mrs f it shake it well here he thumped the arm of his be the best friends from this day be we three friends all jist as me and poor and mrs f heart alive yes we was friends best friends was three then and we be three now us mrs f we three mind a old song as your poor dear mother used to sing richard shall we three meet agen in starm in zunshine ar in rain yes she used to sing it poor soul well now we be three agen us three good friends so if mix the glass mrs drink to the bond good fellowship of course said rosalie indistinctly forgot all about isaac so sorry see to it at once ran out of the room glad to make her escape and richard sat the hearth they were to be friends as his uncle and elias and once been friends he had felt her hand twitch in his as isaac to her the proposition was doubtless as distasteful as to him impossible what was his uncle thinking of there were some flesh and flesh and not brook and bond was one of them but he would be patient for a he would choke down his rebellious sense of injury his secret heaven was secure neither the guileless isaac nor rosalie the faintest idea of the miserable passion which he was striving to conquer what was it she had said they were to for his sake his uncle to whom he kind faithful generous old benefactor well he night in the seclusion of his attic room he once more drew picture on beauty he said on in peace i shall not try you sleep soundly do not even dream after a last silent look he held it steadily in the flame of watching its destruction unflinchingly until the last dropped from his fingers and times he saith must man aye forego and why is life a nobler thing through pain and times sweet apple hangs so low shall i not strongly grasp and count it gain elinor sweetman some time after apparently successful peace making relations between the parties concerned remained unbroken was frequently sent on messages to littlecomb acquitting these occasions in a strictly business like manner and when his uncle thither he made such strenuous efforts to appear ease and to entertain its hostess that isaac was delighted chap talk he would say sometimes under his breath with nod and wink me he talk like prent i is very much as my nevvy know indeed in his desire to avoid those terrible long had so much discomposed him during his first visits to littlecomb upon wild flights of fancy related at length his and delivered his opinion upon men and things with a frequently surprised himself the fact was that he was afraid were he to come to a halt when those blue eyes were fixed could he ever take up the thread of his discourse again even as the mere consciousness of that intent gaze made him but recovering himself he would go on with a rush knowing was making many wild statements but persevering nevertheless he to do all the talking if talking there must be for rosalie silent and his uncle was at no time garrulous the harmony of these relations was rudely broken by an warm afternoon early in june farmer sharpe chanced to be his own gate gazing abstractedly up and down the lane presently an undersized narrow chested figure making its way towards him as it drew near recognised mr samuel cross remarked isaac nodding sideways in his direction him to pass on very fine evening mr sharpe returned samuel pausing and the gatepost with the evident intention of entering very for a quiet walk much in my line returned isaac not without after the men and round the fields and downs to look after the sheep but for a for in my line at all in other line though said samuel and he shot a at the older man out of his little red rimmed eyes met strolling up towards littlecomb just now like ye did agreed sharpe do often go up there chap exclaimed cross rest of us often contrive business agree so well with pleasure paused to snigger and isaac turned his mild grey eyes him samuel cross he remarked suppose as you do slight stress laid upon the personal pronoun appeared to irritate gentleman and he replied with a certain acerbity is as a rule much pleasure to be found in doing mr sharpe among lawyers said isaac nodding placidly been told others besides lawyers though cried samuel are honest he he a very confiding man mr uncle is everyone in your situation that would care such a handsome young man his business manager where a woman was concerned he he your nephew no doubt will do a little too thoroughly nevvy returned isaac loftily be trusted to do his dooty is more nor can be said for many folks as be all for noses where they wanted always sallow complexion assumed an even more jaundiced he retorted people do no business on england they at least suppose mr richard marshall has brought foreign notions back with him was seen two or three weeks ago doing business with mrs as per usual they were close together over just as if he and she were company and he was business details that she was actually crying mr sharpe ejaculated isaac in a kind of roar and nonsense had she to cry for should i know because prices had gone down i suppose since to you they talk nothing but business when they are together drop that cried the farmer losing patience at last be at cross your hints rejoined samuel thrusting his thumbs into his the remark as was passed by the young man that saw them lane will perhaps throw some light on the subject says he he says the widow fiander be a on the new she is off the old so if i do drop a hint mr assumed a virtuous air and struck an appropriate in the way of kindness take my advice and look like sir we lawyers see a deal of the world a deal of the the world and we know that worthy folks are often caught napping you be caught a good look out or your bride snapped up from under your very nose tell you what it is cross cried isaac who had from one foot to the other during the latter part of the and was purple in the face with suppressed ire of advice maybe take a bit from me jist you keep that yourn quiet what do ye mean ye little treecherous spy your nose into other business and to make them as good as father and son i know my nevvy a than you know him my nevvy a snapper so i tell you jist take yourself off out of this and come here more tales else maybe find this here stick mine your shoulders i so strong as i were but i could make to hit a crack or now ye know had started back as words and gestures grew threatening and it better to beat a retreat turning however at a safe bestow a withering valedictory smile upon his adversary and to he was sorry for him since his rejection by rosalie he had been burning with her and desirous of an opportunity of venting it a with sam belbin had resulted in the imparting to him coloured version of the scene which he had witnessed and richard in the lane the desired opportunity seemed to and samuel had hastened to take advantage of it with as seen indifferent success as he now hastened away as rapidly short legs would carry him he encountered the very person he had anxious to traduce richard nodded and would have passed on cross who was still suffering from a redundancy of spite opportunity favourable for venting it are back already he remarked wonder you did contrive a bit longer over your business you would been your uncle seems quite content with your doings as i told has a confiding nature do you mean said richard speaking in a low even voice but ominous flash of the eyes you know what i mean well enough you sly young dog if you the fascinating young lovely dainty mrs f she about though she contrives to look so demure come expression of face need turn rusty over no tales bless you but others besides me that has remarks about the widow new business manager ha may carry on though as far as i am i know too much about the lady to envy you she has played a double now as for the old man find out nothing as a blind as a bat mr cross thrust his tongue into his cheek and made a of countenance calculated to convey an impression of his artfulness and of his contempt for the old sightedness own vision perhaps might with advantage have been a little clearer man of quicker perceptions would have realised that silence was more fraught with danger to him than a torrent words he was therefore considerably surprised when brought down his vigorous right hand upon the cheek at distended by malevolent tongue and before he had spring backwards the other palm inflicted similar chastisement on clerk gasped spluttered and finally uttered a you made me nearly bite my tongue off you right if i had cried richard little reptile if much as say another word of this kind half kill you had seized samuel by the shoulders and was now shaking him and forwards you take back every word of your vile slanders gasped cross in an agony of terror you give me your word to keep that foul tongue of yours quiet lord yes richard marshall for sake let me go half killed me as it is released him with a parting admonition to look out and on his way with a staggering gait and stuffing handkerchief into his mouth still in a white heat of passion was striding along at rate when he suddenly observed the large white clad person uncle standing contemplatively some twenty yards away from the the encounter his good humoured face wore a pleasant and done lad he remarked as soon as richard came within hearing did give it in style i never did see nothing more neat i think richard as mr cross have the toothache i he will only wish i had made every bone in his body ache cried richard fuming as he said something as richard said ceasing his placid chuckles and looking intently at his nephew returned richard annoyed me very much point of fact insulted me now commented isaac was strange i did think to your face richard he was a to me jist now did say some very things agen that was behind ye see i did think the chap would acshally go for to to your face did he say of me said richard breathlessly he did say things about you and mrs f ah the could so much as leave mrs f name out and he were to scarce believe how oncivil he were up and told out as if i did look out be up mrs f your leave or your leave but i give it i can tell says i nevvy a snapper says i my very words little treecherous spy i says your nose into other business i know my nevvy i says my nevvy a snapper isaac paused to chuckle jubilantly and turning slapped his on the back do you think of that for an answer eh that it was an excellent one said richard beginning to stride so rapidly that his uncle could scarcely keep pace with him i told him too pursued the latter if he came agen with tales lay my stick about his shoulders glad you said that exclaimed the young man without turning glad you told him they were lying tales they are the stick isaac reminded him with modest triumph reckon it in rather neat about the stick says i quite as i were but i could make shift to hit a crack or two yet wish i had thrashed him within an inch of his life came the thrown over shoulder richard how you do lay them long legs yourn to the ground isaac pausing to wipe his brow fair out breath bide a bit let me blow there be in sich a lad reckon them there little taps as ye gave cross keep for some time he be gone way anyhow and it do good to run me off my legs came slowly back his face was fixed and stern but he spoke i blame myself to a certain extent for what has happened have guessed that in a gossiping little place like this talk if i went so often to littlecomb i must keep away the present now let yourself get so upset what signifies a bit chatter you need to take no notice of it at all i will take notice of it cried richard choose should take liberties with my name and what is hers need not assure you uncle isaac that i have never said one word fiander that anyone need find fault with be sure agreed isaac course not he came to a sudden pause and cast a sidelong look at his nephew scratching his was one cross was a seed you both a over a gate and mrs f that was very likely i think was as say aught as make mrs f cry drew a quick breath and his hands involuntarily did cry one day he said was the first sunday you took me she i had a bad opinion of her she cried and said i was unjust be the day you went to see the big mead said farmer had made friends then ye have made her richard have course not be so fanciful ye did really have a bad opinion of her from it be a very dear very dear woman is very likely have a bad opinion of mrs f well ye be real trew and ye need to take no notice of idle talk let there be between ye on that account however remained fixed in his determination to avoid the future and in spite of his protests adhered to on the following sunday he was somewhat discomposed to eyes straying towards him once or twice as he knelt on side of the church and it seemed to him that they wore pleading expression purpose however remained unshaken and immediately after the he went out without saying anything to his uncle and could not when the hour came for their weekly pilgrimage to littlecomb waiting some time and vainly bellowing his name the farmer to go without him was in a very taciturn mode at the evening meal and his that mrs f had inquired why he had not come and she saw nothing of him nowadays did not render him more conversation after supper too instead of smoking quietly he in his chair for a few minutes and then rising hastily pacing about the room seem mortal onaisy this evening remarked the farmer after had continued some time down and light up like christian pushed forward a chair invitingly with his foot and richard took drew his pipe from his pocket how hot and stuffy it was in this kitchen where in spite of weather a fire was blazing the windows had not been opened he felt sure the odour of their recent repast still lingered in mingled with the fumes of the particularly rank pipe which his then enjoying he thought of the cool twilight without of the the fresh breeze blowing across them of the path beside the led to littlecomb of the garden garden where the singing and where the roses and syringa were in full bloom ah picture to himself the syringa with its white blossoms shining lamps amid the dusky boughs the garden still and sweet she was wandering at this hour up man said isaac pointing to pipe nephew obeyed but held it absently between his fingers poked the blazing logs with his foot and bent forward hands to the glow his big red face looked unnaturally large surrounding haze of smoke richard half rose from his chair sank back again outside came the tantalising thought again few paces away were the downs and the lonely path through and then the garden farmer was slowly nodding in the comfortable radiance pipe had gone out the garden the garden he rose from his chair strode across the room flung open and was gone before his uncle had time to do more than turn away the moor is dark beneath the moon rapid clouds have drunk the last pale beam of even away the gathering winds will call the darkness soon and profoundest midnight shroud the serene lights of heaven pause not the time is past every voice cries away shelley outside richard flew along as though pursued by a thousand demons were the downs with their delicious tart he raced without pausing to inhale it now to swing over the hedge and the ground that still lay between him and the garden the her his heart was thumping loudly against his ribs a sound as of sea was in his ears on on there were the lights under the dark was the gate set in the high wall shook beneath his violent hand as he flung it open he stood still hardly breathing in his suspense was she there all was for the rustling of the boughs and the faint warbling of than one was celebrating evensong to night what if not be there he walked on slowly and unsteadily now there was a movement amid the greenery close at hand out of arbour set amid the shrubs a figure came gliding forth to she paused two paces away from him and her hands fell by her sides is you she said almost in a whisper it is i stood facing each other in unbroken silence for a full minute she asked still in that breathless whisper did you come i could not keep away turned and began slowly to pace down the path between the roses of perfume were wafted to their nostrils from the syringa blossom yonder stood the bush just as he had pictured to himself suddenly flashed across richard as he walked beside her shrubs were sometimes called orange trees mock mock orange blossom must not pursue that thought further kept away for four days he said suddenly tried to keep day a long pause she faltered was wondering why you did not come made no answer and they walked in silence till the end of the reached and then she said still falteringly think you ought to have come now know i ought not turned and began to retrace their steps but when about mid way garden she came to a standstill and looked him full in the face now she said you must not stay here any longer in the dim light he could see that she was pale and that her but he gazed at her as though without realising the sense of you not leave me she entreated i ask you stood looking at her stupidly for a moment or two longer then of her request seemed to reach his understanding will go he said hoarsely you will give me those flowers in foolish you are she cried yes take them and sake go thrust them towards him and he took them from her cluster moist and sweet instead of fulfilling his promise however a step closer to her you put them in my coat he asked his eyes in his haggard to burn said rosalie drawing back movement and the icy tone that accompanied it recalled him he too drew back hesitated and then throwing the the ground with a passionate gesture departed back again gate across the yard under the lea of the hedge over the downs was home there was the warm light of the fire by which his now the door was open and he stood once more in his presence now richard would be forced to look him in the face a moment he stood with the door handle in his hand and then as man turned to smile inquiringly upon him he suddenly wheeled he cried as he mounted the stairs stared at the closed door for some moments as though expecting open again then slowly turning back to the fire listened the room overhead hasty steps were walking up and down be gone to fetch summat very like remarked the farmer as his pipe to his mouth but after smoking and listening a and marking that the pacing to and fro continued he jerked his thumb upwards nodded and said back then after pausing a moment to ruminate over he made up his mind to the inevitable tapped his pipe hob extinguished the lamp and went upstairs to bed long after he was sunk in dreamless slumbers those hasty have been heard in the adjoining room pacing up and down up like the restless tread of a caged beast was not the only one who spent an unquiet night rosalie too find no rest for her aching heart after some hours of she rose dressed in the dim grey light that was just the world and seated herself by the open window she here without risk of being disturbed for the sun would not an hour and more and even the earliest of her men would not some time after dawn her chin resting on her hand she hearkened vaguely to of sounds which betokened the awakening of nature the crowed long before she had left her uneasy pillow the young been chirping while she had clothed her weary frame but now note was sounding faintly from a neighbouring copse and were chattering in their nests on the ivied wall the was being gradually withdrawn from the face of the earth but familiar objects were only half revealed and the most well known strange and unreal look first sunbeam had not yet struck across the sky when rosalie had been absently fixed upon the irregular line of hedge the approach to the barton saw a dark object moving slowly and presently into the open space before her gate there stepped of a man she knew what man it was even before he had vaulted gate and taken up his stand beneath her window she would worlds to close this window and hasten out of sight but a to be laid upon her and she could neither move nor speak downward with dilated frightened eyes are there said richard looking up with a face as drawn and her own god i wanted to see you before i go i wanted good bye power of speech returned to her and she leaned forth a faint cry you are going i am going is it not the only thing i can do do you think i to sit at his table and take his pay and know that i am a him in my heart did not speak but richard gazing upwards saw the clasp of tighten as they rested on the sill till the nails and white went on passionately word he says to me stabs me every look at his honest unsuspicious face i you must know feel not quite a brute yet and later when you are his think it would be possible for me to go on living within a see you every keep up the farce of friendship what think i am made of face was set like marble only the eyes moved after a long whispered come back knows he answered with a harsh laugh time quite i can no longer feel put her hand before her eyes and then let it drop richard saw anguish in them and his face changed he threw up suddenly with a kind of a sob will not you tell me to stay a moment longer the agonised eyes looked down into his and he saw her waver but it was only for a moment her lips moved first without emitting any sound but presently mastering herself firmly i tell you to is right for you to go bye said richard hoarsely bye faltered rosalie and then there came a great sob turned as if to leave her but wheeling round looked back i to have nothing am i to be sent away without so much as a the hand had vanished from the window and for a moment he stood holding would she come down to she meet him at the door within all was silent will not come he said to himself and once more went on his way blindly forward with his head sunk upon his breast he looked back again he might have seen her creep to the window by it straining her eyes through streaming tears rosalie poor beauty did she wake at last only to look upon form of her prince in the day isaac sharpe came to littlecomb in great perturbation he found rosalie lying on the couch in the parlour the drawn had a headache she said heart alive said isaac sitting down a hand on either knee seem to be wrong this day my nevvy gone himself echoed rosalie faintly turning her face to the wall took himself off this morning a word to anyone and here bit of a note for to explain i much of a hand but bithey did read it for me and he does seem no excuse at all except that he were restless he says told me he were a rover and could settle down and now fit have come on him and he felt he must be off and me very handsome and he tells me he know where he to yet but when he does write and let me know where his luggage and all all repeated rosalie looking at the kind troubled old a bewildered stare that was all of course and she had known she had with her own eyes watched departing it had disappeared from sight she had known quite well that never return she had even told him to go agreed with him that the right and honourable thing to only thing to do the morning she had been telling herself so over and over again none the less the words fell like a knell upon her heart do look bad to be am sorry your head be so bad lard what a world this be that upset i know whether head or my heels quaver in his voice smote rosalie she must make an effort her selfish grief above all to conquer that mad spirit which every now and then rose rampant within her this had need of her sympathy should she not give it all the that there was so large an element of remorse mingled with she sat up and looked affectionately towards him very very sorry for you she said was so sudden ye see pursued isaac dolefully never so said a word to so much as hinted as he war satisfied seen that the restless fit were a on if i had a sammy restless he were that restless last night he were a dog at a fair as had lost his master nor a reasonable human being was up and down and in and out the whole blessed evening ah i upset i be oncommon fond richard ye see always the time he were a little i was oncommon fond his him she were the only woman i ever could put up excepted isaac ducked his head towards her with a melancholy attempt heart sank lower still she turned away he might not see her face at an earlier period she might have by the knowledge that she was one of the few women in the isaac sharpe could up of the kind were approach to ardour and indicated as she knew a of solid attachment but the passionate tones of rung too recently in her look in his eyes was too fresh memory ah what had she not seen in those eyes went on her unconscious future husband be like him and me was the best of not all me like this be terrible ill convenient just is the of year pair hands is wanted did very near the work two men and he must go trapesing hisself giving me no time at all to find somebody to take was a distinct sense of injury in his tone now am sure he never thought of that cried rosalie quickly how could isaac find it in his heart to think of in the face of the overwhelming fact that richard was gone sure he did agreed isaac is a very bad job a very indeed but i suppose there nothing to be done agreed with a sigh it was too true there was nothing to est à ce au feu le vent il éteint le petit mais it allume le grand days passed and richard made no sign rosalie went like the ghost of herself it was known that she was a very severe attack of neuralgia which oddly enough had her on the very day of richard sudden departure guileless people believed in the mrs fiander so very bad and a body could make believe to be so pale among whom was mrs belbin folded their arms and assumed air was likely enough averred this matron for folks pale as had reason to mrs conscience was very she she was a terrible one for on of them on and then a them off no reason sam could say if he a sam did know more than like to talk about others again were of opinion that mrs just wasting away for love of mr nephew and that man had gone of his own accord and had not been dismissed by was very likely said these sages that richard marshall had his own way to make in the world and who was known to have from his uncle would wish to have any unpleasantness in response to the suggestion that the young man would so very bad for hisself if he and widow fiander made a match they returned conclusively that it was quite unpossible for him fiander to make a match of it since her banns were to be given immediately with farmer sharpe somebody had up and axed mrs when the wedding was to be and she had answered that the day yet fixed but that the wedding was to take place as agreed at of july heard none of these rumours but he too wandered about with lengthy and gloomy face day however rosalie looking out from the darkened room where sitting saw him hastening towards her house with every appearance waving a piece of paper in his hand a moment she stood on the threshold have heard from richard cried eagerly have had a letter my dear i have had no letter panted isaac as soon as he enough had a graft have had what inquired rosalie have had a graft my dear a tele one of them nasty wrappers as seems to bring bad news hope it has brought bad news this time said she tremulously went into the house together i hope not said the farmer doubtfully does say much much one way or other out the paper he handed it to her upside down reversed it and read the brief message luggage as soon as possible lime street station liverpool to for then he must intend to go to america again flushed and his jaw dropped mrs f i do call that a to conclusions he quite testily for him have no earthly reason sich a thing is it likely my nevvy go off to only just a comed back did he say he was a to be back to the old know interrupted rosalie quickly for all that sure to return to america now he told me he landed at liverpool and upon it he intends to start from there again yes yes sure of it he did not rest you see until he had put the the country between us and now he means to go further he is at the other side of the world he will be contented spoke with irrepressible bitterness but isaac did not notice it your opinion mrs f he said best lose no time out my little plan i got a plan ye see he added modest triumph it comed to me all of a sudden him mrs f what would be the use of writing said rosalie cannot to come back against his will we force him but i think is only some notion the in his head he seemed quite settled till last week and maybe fit will wore off a bit by now gone all the way ye ought to let off a bit steam maybe wrote him a letter and just axed him straight out he might change we can send a letter with his be too late so he has left the country and he leave the country ye see we can but try can try said rosalie pressing her hand to her head bewildered air i were mrs f if ye jist set down and drop a line for to say if your head a you too was looking at her pleadingly misunderstanding the expression of never mind about my head only only thinking the letter go to day ye see richard did ax most perticlar for his traps to be sent once replied the farmer his eyes round with anxiety if send the letter at the same time we mid miss him used always to write to him for you she said rosalie at the last straw it would have more effect if now my dear if ye be so i take it very kind do it it take bithey very near three days to write a very much obliged to my dear he repeated persuasively adjured she had no resource but to comply and with a beating throbbing brain she set about her preparations going to the window drew up the blind a little way and then collecting pen ink sat down opposite isaac at the table when she had proceedings isaac might have been observed to gather concentrating as it were all his forces in preparation to of composition dipped her pen in the ink rosalie looked inquiringly at him do you wish me to begin she said do start off dear nevvy responded isaac in tone as though he were speaking from beneath a blanket resulted from the mighty constraint he was putting my dear nephew wrote rosalie and then she raised her eyes again farmer cleared his throat drew a long breath and continued slowly with apparently immense difficulty your uncle isaac do say repeated rosalie when she had written the last word crimson in the face was absorbed in the mental struggle perceived with a start that her pen had stopped moving got say well your uncle isaac do say as i hope your mind i better put he hopes said the secretary farmer came out of his brown study and looked up at her inquiringly he you of course if i say uncle isaac i ought to go on same way says if i say it will look as if i were if it were i who wished he would change his mind and wish it asked isaac sharply but bent her head over the paper and answered hurriedly oh of course of course but it would not do for me to tell would be too much of a liberty no my dear richard would think it such but there i with so much must cut in again mrs f hard work letters and if ye go for to speak to i in be all mixed up let me tell my own way knows my ways and understand fast enough now see your uncle isaac wishes for to say as i hope change and come back mrs f is a this for i and she to say is uncle isaac as wants back make it ye see he continued dropping the high unnatural tone essential to dictation and adopting a confidential go for to make no mistakes have wrote that make me write that mr want him to unkind clicked his tongue in desperation mercy he ejaculated here letter never get wrote my dear jist put down what i tell flurry me do get flurried i for the life me think jist that down and go on ye see find come right reluctantly set down the required sentence and found at that isaac had already inflated himself in preparation for effort mrs f wish to come back too as is but she more not to say so fixed his eyes sternly upon her as he enunciated this statement sheer desperation rosalie set it down ye have nothing to complain of i think he we can get on next deep reflection the following words came forth t is most onconvenient for to be a me at such i wish most to come back to week a to cut the church meadow and every hand be wanted feel a bit hurt in my isaac paused to brush his across his eyes and continued hurt in my as you have a left your old uncle like that war well him he muttered parenthetically i say as it were richard wiped his eyes again sniffed drew an immense breath and started like that i do think ye mid said a word but i will not no more but jist ax ye to come straight back all will and forgot now i think mrs f we mid finish ye mid my name and put my mark to it heaved a deep sigh of relief wiped his brow and sat gazing at her appended his signature to the page be my name be it he inquired do look very pretty wrote nice and small i can see as this my name i s a you put a twice mrs f it should be written twice said the farmer gazing at the page doubtfully now put it be a matter taste i suppose well now mark ground his pen slowly into the paper horizontally and remained gazing at it with a certain modest pride shut up now and write his name outside obeyed and held out the document towards isaac but as he to take it she drew it back a deep flush overspreading her face a hesitation however she again tendered it to him it she said with a note of sharpness in her voice have struck a more acute observer than isaac but he duly without noticing that anything was amiss to herself she sat for a moment or two in deep thought her upon her hands then suddenly rising rushed out into the yard sharpe she called the broad back was already vanishing down the lane her voice failed to reach him as he did not turn his head stood looking after him without making further attempts his attention and then slowly returned to the house why call him back after need was there for her thus to could she help writing the letter exactly as he wished and were the qualms of conscience which the remembrance of in it evoked it was his letter not hers it was he who on stating that she wished richard to had him to do so if richard did come back she could not for it if he did come back supporting her throbbing head with her hands she tried to herself but the turmoil in heart and brain for a time forbade train of ideas during the long blank days which had departure and often in the course of the weary this thought had constantly recurred to her with a never he has gone he will never come back now if he did come he came back even for a little while might just see him again if it were only to be once or twice mere suggestion she was conscious of a lifting of the load which crushing her if he were made to know through no fault of hers against her will that she did wish him to who had go forth without a word to stay he even guessed that to see it would be sweet to think he knew that he judge her less harshly that he would realise how hard her struggle raised her head her lips parted in a smile her eyes dreamily the strip of sunlit green outside her window there he had stood he had turned away so mournfully and now he was to come back to come back would he not read between the lines of the not the very words have for him a deeper their guileless originator guessed he not come flying side in a few little more than a few hours perhaps be with her and then gave a sudden gasp and flung herself forward across the table in a moment the web of self deception with which she had to cloak the situation was torn to shreds and she saw a crisis was impending it was folly to pretend that it her unawares it was worse than folly to endeavour to shift to poor unsuspicious isaac if richard returned would have to be gone through again it would be even before for she would have lured him back after he had broken if thus sorely tempted and wrongfully encouraged he were to words which she had seen so often trembling on his lips could she make could she look him in the face and did she mean to do did she mean to keep troth as an honest woman should or did she mean to cast aside good and all truth and honour and self respect and jilt the had been her faithful friend want to do right said rosalie with another gasping sigh told a lie in my life i tell one now i act if he comes back it will only be on false pretences he must allowed to come back lay still for a moment her arms extended a kind of tremor now and then over her frame presently she said again half aloud be deceitful i break my word but oh how hard it is right god help me straightened herself all at once and pushed back the hair from then drawing the blotter towards her wrote a hasty line on of not come back i implore you r f it envelope and directed it to richard with little convulsive sobs she went upstairs bathed her swollen eyes and put on her hat was no one about the down farm when she approached it but she almost fell over a strapped portmanteau that had just inside the doorway as she recovered herself bithey the kitchen door thought you was the carrier she remarked did say as he for him to fetch that there box richard is to liverpool to day mr sharpe in asked rosalie falteringly somehow the sight of made her turn suddenly faint he but him back every minute he be time now and he said he just catch the carrier i had a to get all packed and ready but is done now was all packed the straps fastened the lock made secure too late after all the important postscript which was to letter could not as she intended be slipped among her heart gave a sudden throb that was not altogether of pain had honestly tried but fate willed otherwise think wait she stammered scarcely knowing what she said shall see mr sharpe to morrow and i should only be in your way say you are busy not that busy now just a a parcel of a coat would go in the box nohow and to pack it in paper but is that heavy it do slip out at so soon as i get other wrapped up me help you said rosalie hands are better than two had never seen richard wear this coat yet the mere sight of consciousness that it was his caused a recurrence of that of faintness want a little bit more string bithey she said with the quaver voice which had been noticeable before think a little bit on the dresser shelf returned the and dropping her end of the parcel she went across the kitchen was chance she was white to the very lips but she flinch with cold trembling fingers she hid away the note in pocket of the coat he would be sure to find it there discovered nothing and presently the packet being secured betook herself homewards done it she said pausing when she reached the solitude of god i done it it will be all right now it was not surprising that in the midst of her self having so successfully barred herself out of eden she should once into tears had we never loved sae kindly had we never loved sae blindly never met or never parted we had been broken hearted burns cutting and making of hay had been proceeding briskly church meadow the last swathes had fallen and every available hands had been called upon to assist in the work for prophets had foretold gloomily that the actual be expected to last evening on the second day farmer sharpe stood alone in the the field mopped for the hundredth time his perspiring brow a contemplative look round was past seven the men had gone home some time before but remained to take a final survey of the scene of their labours think so very like to rain remarked isaac looking up sky where indeed no trace of a cloud was to be seen hold will keep up for a bit yet mrs f by now i should begin to find it a bit damp in the dew be falling very fast well go home to my supper passed through the gate at the further end of the field and more than half the distance which separated him from his the sound of heavy but rapid steps behind him made him halt and hunt who had evidently been hastening in pursuit of him paused too great red face wearing an appearance of unusual excitement and blue eyes positively goggling in his head owing to the of work and the need for accomplishing it in a given time persuaded rosalie to consent to his engaging this unwelcome her forces and she had agreed with a meekness that her spiritless condition job it was who had been in foretelling a coming storm partly in order to render the more valuable and partly because of a natural pleasure disaster to mrs crops said isaac gazing at him in astonishment seen what be on yonder sir was counter query be a on where inquired the farmer there returned hunt with a significant jerk of the thumb in of the church meadow at all a on there returned his be just come from empty mr sharpe returned job half closing one eye and assuming knowing look it empty jist you step back and see you was to step up to the dell very advise to go maybe see summat as surprise jist you i mr show where to look and i astonished surveyed him for half a minute or so without speaking and jerked his thumb forwards away he said briefly i mind if i do come but expect to see at all grinned derisively for all rejoinder and led the way as requested with exaggerated caution and turning his malevolent red over his shoulder every now and then to make sure that isaac the latter shambled along at his usual pace and with imperturbable face they drew near the dell a small cup shaped pit surrounded by the upper end of the field the sound of voices was voices a and a however so low when isaac and his companion were close to the brink they no words step mr sharpe sir whispered job excitedly down through the bushes bide here till ye come back paused for a moment or two staring at him with and then went forward presently his tall form the bushes and he looked down into the pit beneath a long and steady gaze he returned to job took him by and propelled him to a safe distance from the tantalising spot when finally released examined him with great curiosity but face though a little redder than usual in consequence his recent exertions was stolid as ever he said in answer to the inquiring gaze sir did see who was there course i did mrs fiander was there where i left her and my there he comed home i see as i axed him said job much disappointed know you were job i been of all this week come seems a bit queer as he should be in mrs

questions or about i known take his fists to a man once as he thought is the way young chaps nodded fixed his eyes impressively on hunt as though to make the meaning of his words had penetrated to that somewhat dull consciousness and finally rolled homewards to placid as ever had not proceeded very far before he paused however shook his head finally stood stock still hands said farmer sharpe reflectively hands now becomes necessary to ascertain what passed before isaac sharpe down through the willow bushes descried richard marshall in proximity to mrs fiander certainly was farther from thoughts when she had in that sheltered spot from the glare of the afternoon sun expectation of the advent of this companion she had in fact that he was by this time out of the country and had indeed up her mind to erase his image definitely from her memory as she frequently told herself she must think only who had always been her friend who was so soon to be her husband must face the thought though she from it oh that this sweet cup of forbidden never been held to her lips she had dashed it from her but of it remained and had taken all the savour out of her life been to her a poisonous cup containing as it did wine from the the tree of knowledge you know very little of life richard to her once alas alas she knew now more than enough elias she groaned to herself sometimes did if you had lived i should have known should have nothing i might have gone down to my grave without knowing was any other love besides that which i gave you an antidote to the rebellious longing of which she was too rosalie had recourse to the panacea she had hitherto in times of affliction hard work since the writing of to richard and the subsequent battle with herself she her old energetic habits once more she rose with the dawn she passed hours in toil no less arduous than that allotted to she avoided solitude as much as possible and strove by in her power to tire herself out tired was she indeed on this particular afternoon that the friendly shade of the grassy nook already referred to herself to be incapable of further effort even when heat had somewhat abated and the retreating voices and heavy her labourers as they trooped homewards warned her that it was she sat on her hands clasping her knees her eyes gazing the ground too weary even to think footstep sounded in the neighbourhood of her retreat but she did her eyes it was some straggler probably hastening to rejoin she could hear the bushes rustling as though brushed by form and kept very still she wanted nobody to speak to her even to look at her but now the step faltered pause and then rapid feet began to descend towards where she sat her eyes first in surprise and a little irritation then wonder what was it that richard saw in them a moment he was bending over her and both her hands were clasped it that particular moment that job hunt chose to pursue or did the acknowledged lovers remain thus longer knew rosalie could never afterwards tell nor could richard as if they were in a dream time place circumstances were a vague undefined intangible bliss of both and in the minds of both lurked the same dread of awakening was rosalie who was first recalled to life her eyes which had on face dropped gradually to his hands gazed idly at those hands then at her own which he was holding then the took shape in her were her hands rosalie that were lying in clasp and they had no right to snatched them away instantly and the charm was broken have come back she cried did you come back came said he i received your letter face was white with anguish his on the contrary flushed eager did you not find the note which i put in your pocket she murmured at him with frightened eyes thought you would be sure to the other was not really mine i had to write what know he answered blithely could see it plainly enough it that which brought me home it was your own precious little line which laid bare your heart to me i had already i found it but we touched at queenstown and i landed there the first boat home i have travelled night and day since was shaking like a reed in the wind begged you not to come whispered begged me not to come sweet and so i guessed i secret my dear love and i felt my own power no she gasped must not speak to me like this listen you know quite well that i cannot listen i belong man richard bent nearer still his face alight with the same triumph that was almost fierce belong to me he said and his words were perhaps the because spoken so low have belonged to me from even from the moment when i saw you in the picture i said no pleaded rosalie in tones as passionate as his but not say it not put it into words hand flew out involuntarily as though to stop his mouth he caught kissed it though it fluttered in his grasp should i not say should i not be brave enough to put the thought which has been in both our minds so often when i picture i fancied myself standing beside you bending over hush hush had withdrawn her hand and was covering her face said to myself he persevered his words coming brokenly because quick breathing said to myself that woman lives she my will search for her until i find her and then when thought you were free i was not free she interrupted dropping her hands and looking eyes fierce and wild like those of a hunted animal am not neither are you free you are bound to him as much as i stares you in the is too late to talk of duty i ought never to have seen you do there is anything which you can tell me that i have not a hundred times he is my he has been my than a father to yes he is the kindest the hearted the most guileless of men it would never enter innocent mind to suspect me of trying to supplant him in i do i am a traitor a ungrateful dishonourable there are no words strong enough or black enough to as i am i know it and i agree to it but i love you rosalie and not give you up of his words were scarcely audible as they came in gusts from lips the veins on his forehead stood out there was the bitter contempt with which he stigmatised his own conduct there was even less possibility of misapprehending his of purpose mean to have you he went on mean to let everything was so much taken aback at the suddenness of the onslaught at the quickness with which he had forestalled all she to urge that she stood before him for a moment absolutely mute moreover with the growing consciousness of her own weakness at his confident assumption of mastery over her he with his eyes fixed upon her face read it like a book own suddenly changed is useless to struggle love he said speaking very gently have both done our have tried to do right has been too strong for us we must just make up our minds to go with the be happy was as has been seen very impressionable very very womanly but for all that there was at her core kernel of strength which is to be found in the hearts of most instinctive sense of rectitude the love of duty for even when the accomplishment of it involves great sacrifice richard full in the face now she said will not take any happiness that has to be bought wrong i made my own choice and fixed my lot in life before i and now i will abide by it very severity of the struggle gave her courage and richard swayed as he was had in him a certain element of responded to the effort she was making was silent and rosalie quick to perceive her advantage went ask you to leave me richard i want you to go now it is quite you have a kind of power over me and that if for a moment but she steadied you go on urging me me you will very likely make me give in in the end but i because you love me not to do this we could not be really we came together through being dishonourable and ungrateful it to do right at all costs as for me i mean to keep my word uncle i will try my best to make him a good wife and to have you thought returned he with a bitterness which he could you thought at all of what is to become of me the is absurd he went on with increasing irritation you a moment that my uncle could suffer a tithe of what i shall suffer know very well he is not capable of it he broke off know what you mean said rosalie colouring faintly would thought of marrying me if i had not first suggested it but i it and he is very fond of me now echoed the young man scornfully as fond as it is in his nature to be he has been faithful to me i will be faithful to him i will do nothing that could pain him some day you too will feel glad that you have not benefactor what do you want me to do said richard still half sullenly she saw by his face that her words had struck home want you to go away quite away as you fast as anything happens to make us change our minds the words in her pleading eyes there was that same piteous weakness which had before touched richard and which now roused most generous instincts will do what you wish he said are a good woman rosalie go night now glanced at him quickly opened her mouth as if to speak and away without carrying out her intention they parted without another word or a clasp of the hands up the bank and disappeared from view and rosalie where he had left her picture music score from surprise symphony richard emerged from the shadowy hollow where he had left standing as if turned to stone he found all the land about with the rosy glow of sunset the long of newly over which he stepped were touched here and there by arrows and the twigs of the hedge towards which he made his way as by fire saw none of these things however but when climbing the low bank through a gap in the hedge he descended into the road he recalled to actualities by the unexpected appearance of figure which seemed to be mounting guard over his bicycle richard started back farmer sharpe rose from his seat on the bank square and determined before him the ruddy light playing upon face and shaggy hair and glorifying his white smock one still rested on the saddle of the bicycle which it almost as richard remained dumbly gazing at him his fingers began an impatient tune on its smooth surface young man gazed desperately first at him and then at the bicycle with an insane desire to possess himself of it and ride away speed but whether because his courage failed him or and more manly feelings gained the ascendency over this he did not put the design into execution gazing steadily at his nephew for what seemed an interminable time removed his hand from the bicycle and pointed in the direction little dell seed there richard he remarked in a sepulchral tone there with mrs f braced himself and looked him full in the face but made said the farmer seed ye both and been a waiting ye richard silence richard indeed felt that it would be useless to either explanation or apology hand crept back to the saddle and resumed its he planted his legs a little more widely apart continuing to stare unwinkingly in his face the tension had become almost unbearable he spoke again thought i wait for here he said thought ye have summat to say to me young man bit his lip and clenched his hands he could scarcely expectant look in those eyes am i to say uncle isaac can i say going away combined effect of sunshine and emotion had already intensified usually healthy colour but this announcement caused it to a positively alarming extent for a moment he seemed in suffocation he raised his hand mechanically to the loose collar smock and clutched at it his eyes seemed ready to start from and though he opened his mouth and rolled his head from side as though about to fulminate against his nephew no words came cried richard much be so angry be so much upset i tell you going away at night sharpe sank down on the bank sliding his legs out before as a pair of compasses his head continued to roll threateningly his eyes to gaze fiercely at richard but it was some time before find voice go to night he said at last in husky suffocating tones no train to night from branston i know but i mean to ride to wimborne and catch train there this catching of the night train at wimborne seemed to be point of depravity isaac positively the fierceness went out of his eyes and to they filled with tears more can i do he faltered torn with remorse and grief as he him did think it of if anybody had told me ye to do such a thing i would believed to go off to as has been a father to not so much as a word paused choked with emotion and fell to wiping his eyes and head disconsolately while richard slowly straightening himself looking down at him job hunt did call me and did out as you was f in hand both hands in both hands he added let on to take no notice i did send job about and i did say to myself wait says i nevvy me all about it jist now and i did go and sit me down here not interfere wait i says will out it act straight i says tell me spoke almost appealingly face which had turned from red was now white again wanted to spare you uncle he murmured at last falteringly groaned and shook his head then drawing a long breath anxiously at his nephew he whispered pleadingly was you a to mrs f when you was a of her hands groaned the other impatiently are some things that about i should have held her scarcely knew that holding them what does it matter now we have said good bye other for ever we have made up our minds never to see each jaw dropped he brought down his fist heavily on the bank he muttered under his breath danged i get not a word know enough said richard fiercely content with what i will never darken your doors again brought down his fist once more on the bank and then himself on to his feet ye have naught to say to i summat to say to you speaking very slowly a to let go that is my way to be speak my mind this night and speak my mind to mrs f where be mrs f along of i richard and find her had squeezed through the gap in the hedge while still speaking had no choice but to follow him a few strides brought them dell and looking down they descried rosalie standing in the as that in which richard had left her fiander called isaac bending over the brink oblige stepping up here the sides be a bit steep and i so young very well go down but i be obliged if you step up summat to say to you and my nevvy here had started violently at the sound of his voice and now summons in silence but she trembled so much and the wet grass so slippery that she stumbled often and it was some time completed the ascent meanwhile both men stood watching her and in silence once or twice she had raised her the great white figure which awaited her on the brink and to her that face was grave and stern like the face of she did not dare once glance at richard but she felt looking at him that their secret was discovered farmer backed a little away from the edge of the dell when forth and stood looking from one to the other then he spoke and with some hesitation fiander as i was a to richard jist now is best to is best to speak out even when it be hard out i get no satisfaction from did acshally to my face as he had made up his mind to go straight off word to i he comes a word and he goes a word mrs f i did see you together jist now and i did think as you summat to tell me was a long pause isaac looked once more from graceful figure to the other culprit who stood with bent head storm of reproach and vituperation the very first pursued isaac still in that solemn and tone did tell my mind plain mrs fiander i did tell out did i as i had never fixed my thoughts was you as was set on i know interrupted rosalie know it too well do not throw my face now it in your face mrs f a throwing what in your face i do say is i did do my best for you go for to for blame i do not deserve raised their heads and looked at him astonished at the change for now the old man seemed to speak more in sorrow than in anger did do my best for i did think and act as kind could and you did never once think of i i did he went on more emphatically left ye both i i never comed in your way but ye mid a thought penitent heads drooped again what need had they to be reminded he had been how unsuspicious how chivalrous in thought went on isaac did leave ye to did ax ye to do you mind how often i axed ye to be friends indeed only too true they had taken a base advantage of they had profited of the opportunities he had given them be more and more unfaithful to him in their hearts thought you be different to what you do be he continued severity cross did tell i as you snap f richard what did i say says i nevvy a snapper ye mind i said the same thing to you well i thought maybe you summat not a word is fair to reproach me like this i kept away as long as i could you know that i do know it know it very well you would come when i did ax that sunday you would come along me nay but you went out by yourself that night and when back ye would so much as sit down and smoke a pipe like christian and next day you must get up and go off were light and what did i do did i do richard you gone off and left me so much as a line i did up hopes of yet i went and wrote a letter and told back and all be forgive and forgot there now and what do to that face was working with emotion his voice tremulous for all never in his life probably had isaac sharpe put so together and every one of them came from his heart to the it seemed as though all their struggles had been futile desires vain their great sacrifice useless for all their days be branded with infamy they had indeed stopped short of of faith to which both had been so strongly tempted but they violated trust even now said at the very last when you were off no explanation i did give one more take it in name do you want to say cried richard goaded you want me to tell you to your face that i love you are going to marry now returned his uncle in an expostulatory tone would far as that i onreasonable all i did ever think for you and mrs f to see if ye could take to each other my notion ye might gived each other a fair young couple stared at him blankly hardly believing their ears cried out with a gasp do you you understand wanted us to love each other interrupted the farmer in a tone that was at once dignified did expect so much straight no no ye mid jist tried to fancy one another ye mid had consideration for me i think ye knowed both on ye would come easy to i and as you did tell me plain the very first night you come home as you was on the look a wife why not mrs f so well as another was turn to gasp now and her face bloomed like a rose evening light but neither she nor richard spoke both were brought down from their heights of heroics that it was should feel somewhat dizzy and confused a man my word said isaac if ye have made up your mind your on i mrs f a deep keep my dear but if richard do so well as me be a convenient ye see it seem a bit queer to change my my time life and to leave the old home where i was born and bred richard he has a very good notion and he be carry on the work in the old way and to take advice from i ah the notion did come to i soon arter he comed here thinks i i wonder if richard be a deal more suitable and more satisfactory to all parties isaac was interrupted by a sudden burst of laughter from which was indeed the outlet of such an of emotions that they had nearly found vent in tears sense of relief the unhoped for joy stirred his very but on the other hand the humour of the situation struck almost equal force after the overwhelming remorse the of shame which but a few moments ago had tortured them to their contemplated sacrifice had very nearly set at naught good dearest wish uncle uncle he cried as soon as the first ecstatic outburst had subsided did you not speak before would been very for me to speak returned still with great dignity knowed my dooty to mrs f and a to say as mid hurt her but i did bring ye together richard and i did try to give ye so many hints could ye mind how often i did say what a dear woman mrs f were what a good wife she make ah many a time i did and ye i used to tell it was bad to hurt a and take a bit pains to be friendly and pleasant her i for some return from richard and i were and expect at least as ye would tell me straight whether you could the notion or whether ye could was the least ye mid do i were that anxious and that see as matter he continued with gathering wrath for now dimpling all over with smiles and hilarity seemed rather than diminish have a straight answer or other will ye give up this here stupid notion going out country richard and bide here and see if you and mrs f up between ye and you mrs f my dear will jist think here matter and see if richard would do as well as me suddenly ceased laughing and stepped to side you rosalie he said very gently and tenderly you try me a little without waiting for an answer he took her hands and laid about his own neck and stooped and kissed her heart alive exclaimed isaac clapping his hands were a bad beginning richard i will say you very slack do make a start he paused to laugh long and loud he cried richard ye do things by halves well f my dear he added more anxiously seeing that rosalie did ye say suppose returned rosalie faintly with her face half hidden shoulder suppose have to try now my dear cried isaac much relieved find ye re pent it and not lose nothing by it neither he added as be jist the same as a son to have all a got to leave when i be gone i want for to seem unkind it be a very great comfort to me if ye could make up your i think murmured rosalie i can make up my mind to it then cried isaac chuckling and rubbing his hands ends well we may say well as ends well best friends as ever but i do think as richard be as a husband my dear ye mid as well see mrs f home now i think go back to my bit supper will be by now i reckon a nod and a broad smile he left them and pursued his homeward way ever and anon to look backwards at the two lithe young moved slowly along above the dark irregular line of very close together outlined against the lambent evening sky after one of these backward glances he began to
