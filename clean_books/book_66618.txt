greg was sure the kids had no right in control of a planet after all what had learned about life still what had he learned transcriber s note this etext was produced imagination stories of science and october extensive research did not uncover any evidence the u s copyright on this publication was renewed old ship wheezed and clattered into the landing slot greg expert pilot but skill was no substitute for outdated equipment unstrapped the safety webbing and eased himself out of the cabin with its worn and scarred electronic gadgetry with he opened the airlock rusting metal screamed as the back into the hull greg found himself panting from the effort in the heavier atmosphere of the earth m an old man he thought bitterly old at forty as antiquated ship and as much in need of repair but no one can do either of us i gave them the stars and in twenty years they they ve made me a museum piece these pampered of the new generation walked down the ramp he hadn t been home for seven years but still surprised that no flight inspector met him with the of check out sheets the landing fields in the colonies more efficiently supervised saw a light in the field control building and walked toward it field sprawling for miles across the california desert was empty mocking moment to the magnificent dream the new generation behind him greg saw the long rows of landing slots shafts raised against the night sky only four ships rested slots his and three other rusting cargo carriers in front unlighted terminal building the passenger liners stood untended hulks that would never lift again fifteen years ago recently as ten years ago the california field had hummed greg could remember the tide of humanity the up trucks gliding like curious ants among the freighters blast of lift tubes the parade of ships trailing flame sky the dream was gone the terminal windows were filmed with dust grew in the cracking asphalt of the field pushed open the door of the control building one man sat feet propped on a desk once the room had required a once the traffic control panel filling a wall nearly of a mile long had been a maze of dancing colored lights board was dead the enamel was peeling the exposed metal was rust attendant took greg s manifest without interest you re our in two years captain he glanced at the sheet i see you re in from mars i m carrying five tons of redearth in the old days such a have cleared three million after transportation costs a industry had been built on the martian antibiotical spore no market i m afraid captain the attendant flipped the sell it at auction i have to raise enough cash to you won t get a buyer i ve got to get some new equipment for my ship you d have done better in the colonies mars has excellent we understand at sky high prices sure the earth isn t building flight equipment any more what s the point kids don t want it the attendant shrugged his shoulders t the first one captain greg who s come home for nothing won t be the last check with me tomorrow i ll see what i out if i can t dispose of my cargo we waive all field charges in cases of destitution you can dump and the kids will stake you to a cargo of iron ore it s triple premium on venus we re told turned on his heel and walked stiffly out of the building word burned in his mind destitution it was like a kick in he thought in a fury of blind anger i gave them the stars make me a charity case this new generation children who build a colonial bubble or pioneer a star route soft minded muscled idiots field attendant hadn t even recognized greg s name the past was alive again like an angry nightmare and the headlines the bands and the screaming mobs the scientists the generals handclasps and just one more sir for the tv cameras a a joint session of the congress of the united states to greg u s rocket forces greg makes mars l a greg first spaceman in n y parade and i say my constituents the name greg shall be forever writ large in of a grateful people greg lands first martian cargo for the discovery of redearth the eternal gratitude of the greg takes nobel prize a small token of of american industry greg joins import firm gratitude of the united patriotic mothers of america on mars colonies on the moons of jupiter venus dream of yesterday and the dream was gone the rocket dead the machines were crumbling into rust and captain a destitute tramp waiting for a handout from a generation which had forgotten him crossed the field toward the clutter of buildings beyond port city raised in less than a year on the the first minor miracle of the new frontier the endless traffic the noisy honky tonks the nervous neon shimmering night the brassy bands and the fancy women all of it was gone sand had drifted across the streets the highpoled still burning cast a blue halo in the empty dirty windows s shoulders sagged as he walked toward the central square city he had to see the monument again he had to drain the from his homecoming in the martian colony they had told would be like this he hadn t believed them how could a legend in a generation a block away he saw the metal statue turned a sickly blue by street light the high shaft of a primitive rocket ship nose foregear lifted proudly toward the stars in the foreground towering giant of a spaceman his legs spread wide to embrace sphere of the earth sky frontier the sculptor had named sat wearily on the granite base of the monument he could read too clearly the lettering on the plaque commemorating the flight earth to mars made by captain victor greg of the u s fleet launched from this site on the first day of june ground his fists against his eyes yet still the through his brain his attitude of dejection was an point to the confident metal monster rising above him years and a new generation made the difference yet there striking similarity between the statue and the man for greg for the original model greg was still a powerful muscular man face was still clean cut and unlined only the torment in his the dream he had lost but nothing is lost it is just different looked up a serious faced boy of twelve stood close to him shadow of the statue one of the new children greg felt a crawl up his spine fear and loathing he hated them they his world they had made him a nonentity yet when the closer and greg saw how frail and small he was the fear you live around here kid greg asked out in the colonies they new children read minds which really wasn t much other abilities but greg refused to believe it not minds the boy corrected him we know your feelings which much the same thing no i don t live in port city i chicago after you landed i thought you might need me chicago fifteen hundred miles the instantaneous living matter greg s mind boggled at the familiar fact he hate and the fear again these were not the natural children but monstrosities spawned by an unknown universe and eating heart of human culture greg stood up his arms stiff and his when i need the help of a kid he growled i ll know it to cash in my chips it s wrong to think that way captain greg no pint sized child s going to tell me i wanted to make things easier for you you should have stayed in it was a mistake to come home now you re trying to drive us off the earth we want to save you the discomfort of homecoming we can t turn clock neither can you strode down the deserted street through the small drifts of sand recognized the corner where there used to be a bar he flung door and entered the long dark room the stale air smelled of neglect his boots echoed hollowly on the oak floor he fumbled match and in the pale yellow light he saw the bottles crowding snatched a fifth of bourbon and ripped off the cap he gulped thirstily and the hot fire burned warm in his veins after drink he felt the strong self confidence of his manhood again leaned his elbow against the bar and glanced toward the street eyed kid was out there somewhere waiting like a nightmare he had already done his magic and transported himself back didn t matter the kid wasn t human greg took another pull bottle and he saw it all very clearly in the beginning men about life forms on other worlds before greg s to mars the sunday supplements had been filled with a of lurid speculations yet the spacemen had found virgin worlds which became the colonies of man the greg understood it now they had looked for intelligent life forms but there had been something out there something as a virus epidemic and as deadly it had invaded and captured the minds of the children killed the bottle by that time he was very impressed with of his own reasoning small inconsistencies kept his mind and it seemed strange that no one had ever thought of but all that was of no consequence heard footsteps outside his body tensed was it the kid he would know what greg was thinking he would know how was to the real truth and the new children no invaders remember that would not let him survive they were puny physically greg had no reason to be afraid of them how was he to fight an enemy who could instantly disappear thousands or millions of miles away shuffling steps came closer a stooped white haired man and unpressed tweeds stepped through the door greg seized s shoulder the man gave a bleat of animal terror who the hell are you greg demanded dr vayle adrian vayle the astrophysicist greg remembered the name from the ponderous had studied in the flight school old man straightened his shoulders with a semblance of pride me what are you doing in port city this is where i live i couldn t stand it in the city any longer didn t want to emigrate to the colonies the children don t object bring us supplies holly and i are quite comfortable dr his fingers over greg s uniform you re a pilot i haven t met years usually the children send them back to the colonies as they land where do you live dr vayle the best hotel in town i ll show you he bent closer and whispered and i ll let you see what we re working on but i have to have first vayle groped in the dark for a bottle he drank eagerly wiping his lips on his sleeve and the astrophysicist went outside greg looked along street for the twelve year old but the boy was nowhere perhaps he had returned to chicago yet if he had come to back to the colonies would he have given up so easily blue intersection lights swam in a comfortable haze spinning looked at them directly occasionally the drifts of sand seemed like water and greg became unsure of his footing he knew he but alcohol had never interfered with his reasoning back bar he had made a tremendous discovery he mustn t let it slip the children were alien invaders that was it in the morning be able to decide what he was to do with the information old man took him to a pseudo spanish structure across the from the field the biltmore hacienda at one time and costliest hotel in port city now the neon signs were out streetfront shops were closed and only a pale light glowed the ornate iron gate he followed vayle up the three tile steps greg looked back field he saw his ship standing in its landing slot someone to unload his useless cargo of redearth the field displaying an unusual conscientiousness greg thought he hadn action in less than a week abruptly greg knew the real significance of such prompt service fit with the discovery he had made in the bar the only trouble was mind was too hazy for him to grasp the connection clearly it to him later he was sure of that followed vayle through the dusty thick carpeted lobby vayle a disorderly room adjoining the cavernous hall of the dining room the tables were covered with dust and the band instruments on the bandstand the astrophysicist swept a litter of pages from his bed and sat down he fished a bottle of under the bed and took a long drink for my nerves he apologized saw a score of empty bottles in the debris on the floor vayle had been treating his nerves for a long time up one of the manuscript pages it was a part of a book the patter of phrases was familiar but the whole context without beginning or end my new text vayle explained when it s finished the kids to publish it that s why they let me stay here so i in peace he pulled at the bottle again they re still heart an adult can twist them around his finger if he goes at you mean the book s just a blind scientist eyed greg carefully you re too old you can t be one he rolled back the mattress and took out a thin file of paper it tenderly in his hand i m analyzing the cause sir i to demonstrate how the children have made us believe they to defy the laws of physics when i publish this the be over handed over the file reluctantly greg turned back the cover shock sobered him vayle was an established authority vayle was scientist vayle was a man greg had learned to respect book vayle showed him contained nothing but blank pages you re interested in our project throaty silky voice came from the open door greg whirled he tall thin woman heavily painted she was wearing a bangled which hung loose from her shoulders her beauty had faded her face was a lined marble mask her yellow hair was gray fifteen years ago greg could have found her in any port city honky tonk her thin hips swaying with jargon of the music and invitation in her eyes this is holly wilson vayle said my secretary greg thought so that s what they were calling it now s profession had gone by many names the pickings on earth become mighty thin if she were satisfied to saddle herself white haired professor of astrophysics greg introduced himself contemptuously you re just in from the colonies captain she asked yes staying long that depends i have a cargo to auction and the kids will take care of that but you ll stay through tonight let s see if we can find you a room thought he knew what she had in mind but as soon as they of earshot of the scientist s bedroom she said come outside i have to talk to you went into the tiled patio of the hotel the kidney shaped pool and its basin was criss crossed with gaping cracks many of shrubs had died untended but the palms still flourished laced skeletal fingers across the face of the full moon desert wind washed through the trees the ghost whisper of that had died in port city don t say anything to dr vayle about his book holly wilson s surprisingly sincere play along with him please let him go he s found the great secret what is it alcoholism or madness a little of both no one s really sane any more i came home the last time seven years ago it wasn t this bad then s happened most of the adults have emigrated to the colonies there are only derelicts left like adrian vayle and myself sober greg remembered the discovery he had stumbled on in and the logic still held up they ve taken over the earth men out the children you talk as if tell me everything about it from the beginning the kids are different that s all there is to it they read minds move themselves anywhere they please simply by thinking about it knows what else they ll learn to whip up after they get the hang are all the children like this no the others emigrated with their parents dr vayle says there five million that s approximately the total population of now they ve shoved the rest of us out by force who wants to hang around like a pet ape to amuse his own brats dr was too old to go i i couldn t get a medical clearance i don t think the colonies are aware that the emigration was so large why should they be we ve half a dozen worlds out there they us all so the kids have taken over everything what they wanted yes for a while we thought it was temporary dr didn t begin drinking until we knew the change was permanent oldest kids are nineteen now they re beginning to marry and children have the same abilities or witchcraft call it what as old as nineteen then the change dates from from your first flight captain greg i sometimes look at that in the square and laugh till it hurts a brave new frontier but that wasn t all you gave us you believe i m responsible for greg gestured toward the slow the patio for this who else captain it s the kids who should build you a monument them the earth the first time greg saw the monstrosity hidden by his dream made the pioneer flight and he had created this new generation relationship was plain if he could unravel it and find the but he knew that now an invasion an invisible virus life taken over their minds how when he knew that how could he how could he turn back the clock and restore the earth to man walked slowly to the end of the patio where he could see field across the highway in the slot they were still redearth of mars out of the hull of his ship he smiled grimly ago the redearth had been priceless that one import alone the conquest of space commercially possible redearth had city and the colonies redearth had created the import companies so tremendously profitable light burned for a moment above greg s ship clearly he saw the puny year old boy and the four other children who were dumping it gave him another explosive insight greg knew then how had come from the stars redearth of mars the invisible molds of that unknown world the alien life form no man had recognized the enemy was tangible enemy was real and such an enemy could be conquered s first inclination was to cross the road and smash with his pint sized weaklings who had stolen his world physical conflict was something man understood and respected but the children human he must never allow himself to forget that they had to on other terms greg had to escape the earth without letting them read his measure his hatred until he could lift his ship he had to with whatever plans they made for him the children didn t here escape should be easy if he could only wall off his thinking turned back toward the faded woman in the scarlet dress of factly as he could he asked her to show him his room i leave tomorrow they re doing an efficient job out there the kids don t waste any time they ll stake you to a cargo of for venus that s the usual procedure she put her arm and you promise captain you won t say anything to dr vayle why are you so interested in that old fool we re derelicts it would be damn lonely without him he has believe in nonsense yes but what difference does that make i can almost believe in it too men aren t licked yet laughed you noble souls who drop in on us out of space talk that s your brand of madness captain thank your stars t have to get to know the kids as well as we do took him to a room on the first floor of the hotel the air opened the door was stale the full moon behind the venetian an unpleasant symbolic shadow pattern of prison bars on greg ripped open the zipper of his flight jacket his chest with sweat the woman turned to go and he caught her arm toward him this much at least hasn t changed he grinned neither resisted nor responded she stood looking up into his face eyes were cold and tired i have to go back to adrian he s frightened when i leave him alone too long that doddering graybeard none of the things that used to be so important matter any more have left is our love for each other adrian and i have that t want to lose it glided away from him angrily greg jerked up the blinds to prison symbol and ground open the windows the hot desert through the screen greg stripped off his uniform and on the bed a time he slept fitfully caught in a confusion of the hope of yesterday and the disillusionment of now his a pioneer and the pain of his responsibility for what his created out of the chaos a pattern of action slowly emerged in the small hours before the dawn greg made up his mind would do would be futile to try to arouse the colonies to attack the earth man in his own soul might admit the truth but as a culture all reject it they needed to keep the symbol of earth as home they might never return to it even if that could be overcome war was not the answer only if were taken completely by surprise given no time to use abilities could they be effectively destroyed knew how that could be done a decade before his pioneer mars the first artificial satellite had been sent up in an the earth a purely military weapon capable of destroying on the surface of the earth the satellite had balance of power and forced the creation of a united world of a planetary government had made greg s first afterward in the excitement of exploiting the new frontier satellite had been forgotten it was still there still armed with a firepower capable of earth clean of life it would be the murder of a world but save human kind greg could do it alone his only problem was his ship without the children knowing what was in his mind no guilt no pang of conscience once the decision was made easily and he awoke completely refreshed with only a from the liquor he had drunk the night before vayle and holly wilson insisted that greg breakfast with them hotel he would have preferred to forage for himself the s protective maternal affection for the astrophysicist made uncomfortable it was not the sort of behavior he would of either of them greg s discomfort quickly became a guilt if he used the old satellite wheel to destroy the he would be slaughtering the few human beings who remained earth discreetly he asked how many others had stayed behind it s hard to say vayle told him a hundred thousand perhaps do you keep up any sort of contact why should we we re outcasts with a sudden rationality he added we re ashamed when we re together we feel bound to face the truth s impossible for man to admit he s a second rater so we hide out villages like this one and pretend all this nightmare then vayle slipped back into his delusion again however that will be different as soon as my research is finished why know captain i m leaving this morning greg broke in would you like to go shook his head i m too old to make a new start on captain he reached for the woman s hand and as long as can t have a clearance leave us as we are holly said your dream is no better than ours breakfast greg left the hotel and crossed the highway to it was still early morning but the desert sun blazed hot in sky as greg passed the old terminal building the twelve boy suddenly materialized and fell in step beside him was the thing greg feared most he began to walk more rapidly a rising panic how could he keep the kid from prying into desperately he tried to think of something else anything banal the children were not gods they couldn t dig deeper than thought or could they greg wasn t sure we re giving you a cargo for venus the boy said conversationally it will put you in business again captain the martian colony to repair your ship you ll have enough cash to pay for it fine greg grunted in his mind he was frantically reciting a grandmother had taught him ago one two buckle my shoe open the door reciting it with fervor like a prayer which it was after this captain it might be better if you stayed in the colonies t get me wrong you re welcome on earth anytime you want to but conditions are different here and the boy s tone changed but you aren t responsible captain s muscles tensed so the boy had probed that deep a new frontier always means change captain but not tragedy we ve never supposed any of you would believe that you gave miracle the greatest frontier men have ever crossed when all pioneers are forgotten captain your name words like the pretty speeches greg had listened to ago they wanted to confuse him make him doubt the decision made one two buckle my shoe three four open the door boy caught greg s sleeve you might as well blame galileo because they studied the universe or go back to blame the unknown who did our first scientific pioneering and galileo what was the kid trying to say and why twelve year old speak so glibly so knowingly of the giants his alienness when greg was twelve the only thing he about seriously was football or baseball or summer vacation he was going to get out of the piano lessons his mother imposed boy pulled him to a stop the first pioneer captain do you for it all we don t know his name but we do have his monument captain greg in the drifting sand the boy sketched the a wheel panicked he was too intent upon keeping his mind make any other interpretation the wheel symbolized the above the earth then the boy knew what greg was going to do swung his fist blindly he took the boy by surprise the no time to rematerialize at a safe distance greg s fist chest and the boy went down with a cry of agony greg felt surge of satisfaction humanity hadn t been defeated and the children were by no means invulnerable surprise gave men their trump card over these undernourished sprinted toward his ship the body lay on the drifting for breath gesturing futilely with his small hand s foot was on the ramp when he heard a scream behind him back toward the road he saw dr vayle and holly wilson him a mongrel frothing at the mouth was yapping at reacted with an altogether human instinct he ripped a metal from the ramp rail and went back to help them two fellow trouble a tiny warning of logic flamed briefly in his mind be a trick his only real chance of escape was to leave now he could but he ignored it ran across the field and swung the bar at the dog crushing with one blow the woman clutched his arm her hands her face was white with fear what happened greg demanded adrian and i were clearing the breakfast table suddenly the he was just there growling at us a mad dog the astrophysicist added the kids did it they can living thing appear anywhere they please a trick greg said the whisper of logic had been right he where the boy had fallen the child was gone they re trying to make me leave vayle complained before i research they know i have the answer to now you have no other choice greg snapped he pulled the his ship the woman followed greg reasoned that he might an outside chance the children obviously had expected him to back to the hotel that would have given them a chance to ship pushed the two through the airlock his luck still held he toward the safety webbing and jerked down the firing toggle ship quivered in the thunder of the power tubes greg dialed course on the pilot computer was the simplest setting he could make his was an old ship the satellite had still been used as an initial landing station the new fuel had made the big wheel obsolete every ship had an automatic satellite course projection taped in the without a new setting the ship would move into the core the wheel and the lock would open automatically when the was completed felt the sudden crushing weight of gravity he caught at webbing until the pressure stabilized from that point remembered his early flights accurately it would be six the ship reached the satellite he had won nothing could nothing holly wilson screamed and greg saw the twelve year old beside the flight console it wasn t a virus invasion the child said shouting to be the roar of the power tubes i didn t know you were this morning i could have explained if swung his fist against an emptiness the boy rematerialized away reset your course the boy cried you understand machines captain don t and i can t get enough technical information from your do it for you one two buckle my shoe greg thought in an ecstacy of triumph had kept that much of his thinking safe the kids were making effort to save themselves he was sure of that but it wouldn they had the alien skill to pry into a human mind but they against man s machines inexorably the computer would ship to the satellite nothing could stop it think rationally the boy pleaded not with your emotions you four minutes left captain greg if the redearth was a as you believe it was why were only the children affected made it an antibiotic we used it for millions of people was innoculated before he emigrated was lying he had to be lying he was trying to confuse greg issues it didn t matter now how the virus had been brought the earth three four open the door five six pick up sticks we aren t different captain we ve simply crossed your frontier different way we have a theory how it happened but no proof redearth worked as a sort of mental catalyst when it was newly born infants it awoke the full thought potential of cortex that s all we have no ability that men haven t capable of if you believe that you can do it yourself mystical nonsense did the kid really think greg would greg glanced at adrian vayle the scientist s face was horror sweat stood in beads on his lips holly wilson to his hand i drew a wheel in the sand for you captain another monument pioneer the first primitive who grasped what we might do rolling disk he gave us terror and disaster yes but he gave too do we blame him because his heirs sometimes discovery do we call ourselves alien invaders because we more complex technology than his then why heap shame on you gave us a frontier in the stars it won t end the way it would nothing ever does we re your children captain re your new frontier aliens greg spat my research was for nothing dr vayle said numbly the words were of agony the torment of a soul ripped out of the of madness don t say that you ll finish your work holly told him soothingly pushed her away not now it was pointless boy wrung his hands you have only two minutes left forget put aside your self pity it s a luxury you can t afford use the brains god gave you captain greg you can t land satellite you must swung again and again he missed the boy but he lost his plunged into the pilot computer smashing the machine greg he had done and began to laugh it was impossible now for change the course setting the boy s pleading was for nothing twelve year old rematerialized and stood looking at the then shrugged his shoulders calmly a minute and a captain and now you have no choice the child sighed as might have sighed over the prank of a mischievious son you killed the mad dog he said you didn t hesitate about that him into port city to give you an object lesson you point i m afraid you couldn t understand that you were mad dog yapping at our heels potentially all the older us the same way your kind of emotional reasoning in or another will sooner or later infect them all we migration to the colonies in order to prevent a conflict the redearth to every adult who left the earth we might make a few of them realize their mental capacity the catalyst works only with an infant and not always then a sense captain greg your frontier has made us two species ours yours the rejects the unfinished men vayle made a choking sound deep in his throat his dream was gone comfort of his madness had been stripped away from him and if it does come to the point of conflict the boy went we fully intend to survive not after i reach the satellite greg answered grimly his hollow and uncertain even to himself the boy had dramatic fiction of a virus invasion greg s dream too was gone i tried to save you captain but by your own violence you made now you will provide another object lesson what i you is true every man has our ability in sixty seconds your reach the old satellite the airlock will open automatically will be no air in the wheel this shell rusted open years ago face death just as certain as if you leaped into outer space can save yourselves all three of you by thinking yourselves the earth or out to one of the colonies this experiment a great deal we didn t intend to resort to it quite so soon ve given us an ideal opportunity if you can unshackle your we have hope for the rest of the rejects there will be fewer for us to dispose of later on boy was gone felt the ship slide into the ramp of the satellite he heard clang against the hull and the scream of rusting metal as began to open a paralyzing emotional opiate flamed through this was a dream nothing more in a moment he would jerk and be amused by his terror but there was something else in too a stirring of greatness a fire of magnificence a new had never known before he groped blindly toward that pinpoint a great distance like an echo of shattering ice he vayle s voice the children have mastered the art of but obviously they cannot violate the established our problem is entirely mechanical i am sure captain greg out had found the sublime ignorance of sanity and that was kiss me holly wilson whispered nothing else matters adrian she had chosen the equally blind sterility of resignation knew they were both wrong he was a realist a spaceman had to be kid had been able to read his thoughts naturally the kid could weird sense of a new self in greg s mind it was only a clever manipulation of words to keep greg from using the satellite squared his shoulders the star point of greatness flickered out mind greg was a man a product of a sophisticated and this undernourished alien generation wasn t going to with mystic mumbo jumbo about belief he knew how to sort out childish magic walked toward the lock straight and proud with the confidence he was smiling savagely mankind was no mad dog to be oblivion by a pack of puny children they might as well learn then the airlock screamed open end of the project gutenberg ebook the pioneer editions will replace
