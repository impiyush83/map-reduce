impression of 1931 first edition 1900 oxford of english 1250 chosen edited arthur quiller at the clarendon printed in great the fellows and trinity college a house of ancient liberal and my most kindly this anthology i have tried to range over the whole field of from the beginning or from the thirteenth century to this of the nineteenth and to choose the best nor have i sought islands only but wheresoever the muse has followed the among living tongues she most delights to honour to bring render so great a spoil compendiously has been my it is for the reader to judge if i have so managed it as those who already love poetry and to implant that love in minds not yet initiated scheme is simple i have arranged the poets as nearly as possible of birth with such groupings of anonymous pieces as for convenience too as well as to avoid a dispute royal gathered the most of the ballads into the middle of the where they fill a languid interval between two winds the italian dying down with milton and the french the heels of the restored royalists for convenience again i myself certain rules of spelling in the very earliest and spelling are structural and to modernize is to destroy as old inflections fade into modern the old spelling becomes less vital and has been brought not i hope too abruptly with that sanctioned by use and familiar to do this seemed to discourage many readers for the sake of diverting others by of antiquity which to be essential should breathe of than an odd arrangement of type but there are scholars whom expect to agree with me and to conciliate them i have and milton from the rule of archaic and otherwise difficult words are given at the the page but the text has not been disfigured with reference marks rather than make the book unwieldy i have reluctantly when some obscure passage or allusion seemed to a timely word with more equanimity when the temptation was or for the function of the anthologist in silence has been taken with the texts but i have sometimes thought with the aim of the book to prefer the more beautiful to attested reading i have often excised weak or when sure that excision would improve and have not hesitated a few stanzas from a long poem when persuaded that they alone as a lyric the apology for such experiments can only lie success but the risk is one which in my judgement ought to take a few small corrections have been made when they were quite obvious numbers chosen are either lyrical or epigrammatic indeed i if a single epigram included fails to preserve at least thrill of the emotion through which it had to pass before lips let it fall with however exquisite deliberation but spirit is volatile and notoriously hard to bind and seems to grow wilder with the years with as with the fisherman who knows the fish at the end of line the gift if he have it comes by sense improved by practice definition if he be clever enough to frame one comes thought i know that it helps and am sure that it mislead set my heart on choosing the best i resolved not to be common objections against anthologies that they repeat one the proverb δὶς ἢ τρὶς τὰ καλά loses all application or my judgement should often agree with that of good critics the the best though a hundred judges have declared it so nor had any feat to search out and insert the second rate merely because to be recondite to be sure a man must come to such a task haunted by his youth and the favourites he loved in days when much enthusiasm but little reading a deeper lurks in the legend told my infant than lies upon that truth we live to learn of my contemporaries can erase or would wish to erase the minds took from the late mr golden treasury and has returned to it again and again with an affection born on many journeys must remember not only what the includes but the moment when this or that poem appealed and even how it lies on the page to mr lyrics from song books and his other treasuries i own a more nor am i free of obligation to anthologies even more recent household book of poetry mr locker lyra elegantiarum mr poets and poetry of the century mr paradise of english poetry mr english lyrics lyra celtica mr book of irish verse and mr treasury of minor british poetry though my rule to consult these after making my own choice yet i can claim help derived from them though gratefully owned bears but proportion to the labour special and desultory which has the making of my book the is not quite the dilettante business for is too often and ignorantly derided i say this and since my wish is that the reader should in his own forget the labour which too has been pleasant that aside i may believe this book has made the when in the right hour they come to him to uplift or ἄκλητος μὲν ἔγωγε μὲνοιμί κεν ἐς δὲ

and hartes delight in youth is pleasure in youth is pleasure 46 amantium iræ in going to my naked bed as one that would have slept i heard a wife sing to her child that long before had wept she sighèd sore and sang full sweet to bring the babe to rest that would not cease but crièd still in sucking at her breast she was full weary of her watch and grievèd with her child she rockèd it and rated it till that on her it smiled then did she say now have i found this proverb true to prove the falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love then took i paper pen and ink this proverb for to write in register for to remain of such a worthy wight as she proceeded thus in song unto her little brat much matter she of weight in place whereas she sat and provèd plain there was no beast nor creature bearing life could well be known to live in love without discord and strife then kissèd she her little babe and sware by god above the falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love she said that neither king nor prince nor lord could live aright until their puissance they did prove their manhood and their might when manhood shall be matched so that fear can take no place then weary works make warriors each other to embrace and left their force that failèd them which did consume the rout that might before have lived their time their strength and nature out then did she sing as one that thought no man could her reprove the falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love she said she saw no fish nor fowl nor beast within her haunt that met a stranger in their kind but could give it a taunt since flesh might not endure but rest must wrath succeed and force the fight to fall to play in pasture where they feed so noble nature can well end the work she hath begun and bridle well that will not cease her tragedy in some thus in song she oft rehearsed as did her well behove the falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love i marvel much pardy quoth she for to behold the rout to see man woman boy and beast to toss the world about some kneel some crouch some beck some check and some can smoothly smile and some embrace others in arm and there think many a wile some stand aloof at cap and knee some humble and some stout yet are they never friends in deed until they once fall out thus ended she her song and said before she did remove the falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love 47 a lullaby sing lullaby as women do wherewith they bring their babes to rest and lullaby can i sing too as womanly as can the best with lullaby they still the child and if i be not much beguiled full many a wanton babe have i which must be with lullaby first lullaby my youthful years it is now time to go to bed for crookèd age and hoary have won the haven within my head with lullaby then youth be still with lullaby content thy will since courage quails and comes behind go sleep and so beguile thy mind next lullaby my gazing eyes which wonted were to glance apace

inherit of blessèd saints for to increase the count so let us rest sweet love in hope of this and cease till then our tymely joyes to sing the woods no more us answer nor our eccho ring song made in lieu of many ornaments with which my love should duly have been dect which cutting off through hasty accidents ye would not stay your dew time to expect but promist both to recompens be unto her a goodly ornament and for short time an endlesse moniment 83 from an elegy she fell away in her first ages spring yet her leafe was greene and fresh her rinde and her braunch faire blossomes foorth did bring she fell away against all course of kinde for age to dye is right but youth is wrong she fel away like fruit blowne downe with winde weepe shepheard weepe to make my undersong yet fell she not as one enforst to dye ne dyde with dread and grudging discontent but as one toyld with travaile downe doth lye so lay she downe as if to sleepe she went and closde her eyes with carelesse quietnesse the whiles soft death away her spirit hent and soule assoyld from sinfull fleshlinesse how happie was i when i saw her the shepheards daughters dauncing in a rownd how trimly would she trace and softly the tender grasse with rosie garland crownd and when she list advance her heavenly voyce both nymphes and muses nigh she made astownd and flocks and shepheards causèd to rejoyce but now ye shepheard lasses who shall your wandring troupes or sing your virelayes or who shall dight your bowres sith she is that was the lady of your holy dayes let now your blisse be turnèd into bale and into plaints convert your joyous playes and with the same fill every hill and dale for i will walke this wandring pilgrimage throughout the world from one to other end and in affliction wast my better age my bread shall be the anguish of my mind my drink the teares which fro mine eyes do raine my bed the ground that hardest i may finde so will i wilfully increase my paine ne sleepe the harbenger of wearie wights shall ever lodge upon mine ey lids more ne shall with rest refresh my fainting sprights nor failing force to former strength restore but i will wake and sorrow all the with philumene my fortune to deplore with philumene the partner of my plight and ever as i see the starres to fall and under ground to goe to give them which dwell in darknes i to minde will how my fair starre that shinde on me so bright fell sodainly and faded under ground since whose departure day is turnd to night and night without a venus starre is found and she my love that was my saint that is when she beholds from her celestiall in which shee joyeth in eternall blis my bitter penance will my case bemone and pitie me that living thus doo die for heavenly spirits have on mortall men and rue their miserie so when i have with sorowe importune fates which vengeance on me seeke and heavens with long languor pacifide she for pure pitie of my sufferance meeke will send for me for which i daylie long and will till then my painful penance eeke weep shepheard weep to make my undersong 84 easter most glorious lord of lyfe that on this day didst make thy triumph over death and sin and having harrowd hell didst bring captivity thence captive us to win this joyous day deare lord with joy begin and grant that we for whom thou diddest dye being with thy deare blood clene washt from sin may live for ever in felicity and that thy love we weighing worthily may likewise love thee for the same againe and for thy sake that all lyke deare didst buy with love may one another entertayne so let us love deare love lyke as we ought love is the lesson which the lord us taught 85 cards and kisses cupid and my campaspe at cards for kisses cupid paid he stakes his quiver bow and arrows his doves and team of sparrows loses them too then down he the coral of his lips the growing cheek but none knows how with these the crystal of his brow and then the dimple of his chin all these did my campaspe win at last he set her both his eyes she won and cupid blind did rise o love has she done this for thee what shall alas become of me 86 welcome what bird so sings yet so does wail o the nightingale jug jug jug jug tereu she cries and still her woes at midnight rise brave prick song who now we hear none but the lark so shrill and clear now at gate she claps her wings the morn not waking till she sings

spring where fairest shades did hide her the winds blew calm the birds did sing the cool streams ran beside her my wanton thoughts enticed mine to see what was forbidden but better memory said fie so vain desire was chidden hey nonny nonny o hey nonny nonny into a slumber then i fell and fond seemèd to see but could not tell her feature or her fashion but as babes in dreams do smile and sometimes fall a weeping so i awaked as wise that as when i fell a sleeping philip 88 the bargain my true love hath my heart and i have his but just exchange one for another given i hold his dear and mine he cannot miss there never was a better bargain driven my true love hath my heart and i have his his heart in me keeps him and me in one my heart in him his thoughts and senses guides he loves my heart for once it was his own i cherish his because in me it bides my true love hath my heart and i have his 89 song who hath his fancy with fruits of happy sight let here his eyes be on sweetest light a light which doth and yet unite the eyes a light which dying never is cause the looker dies she never dies but in life of heart he ever dies that in love his chiefest part thus is her life still in never dying faith thus is his death rewarded since she lives in his death look then and die the doth answer well the pain small loss of mortal treasure who may immortal gain immortal be her graces immortal is her mind they fit for heavenly places this heaven in it doth bind but eyes these beauties see not nor sense that grace descries yet eyes deprivèd be from sight of her fair eyes which as of inward they are the outward seal so may they live still sorry which die not in that weal but who hath fancies with fruits of happy sight let here his eyes be on sweetest light 90 voices at the window

beauty beauteous by that sweet ornament which truth doth give the rose looks fair but fairer we it for that sweet odour which doth in it live the canker blooms have full as deep a as the perfumèd tincture of the roses hang on such thorns and play as when breath their maskèd buds discloses but for their virtue only is their show they live and unrespected fade die to themselves sweet roses do not so of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made and so of you beauteous and lovely youth when that shall vade my verse distils your truth 151 vii being your slave what should i do but upon the hours and times of your desire i have no precious time at all to spend nor services to do till you require nor dare i chide the world without end whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you nor think the bitterness of absence when you have bid your servant once adieu nor dare i question with my jealous where you may be or your affairs suppose but like a sad slave stay and think of save where you are how happy you make those so true a fool is love that in your will though you do any thing he thinks no ill 152 viii that time of year thou in me when yellow leaves or none or few do upon those boughs which shake against the cold bare choirs where late the sweet birds sang in me thou the twilight of such as after sunset fadeth in the west which by and by black night doth take away second self that seals up all in rest in me thou the glowing of such that on the ashes of his youth doth lie as the death bed whereon it must expire consumed with that which it was by this thou which makes thy love more to love that well which thou must leave ere long 153 ix farewell thou art too dear for my possessing and like enough thou thy estimate the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing my bonds in thee are all determinate for how do i hold thee but by thy granting and for that riches where is my deserving the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting and so my patent back again is swerving thyself thou thy own worth then not knowing or me to whom thou it else mistaking so thy great gift upon misprision growing comes home again on better judgment making thus have i had thee as a dream doth in sleep a king but waking no such matter 154 x then hate me when thou wilt if ever now now while the world is bent my deeds to cross join with the spite of fortune make me bow and do not drop in for an after loss ah do not when my heart hath this sorrow come in the rearward of a conquered woe give not a windy night a rainy morrow to linger out a purposed overthrow if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last when other petty griefs have done their spite but in the onset come so shall i at first the very worst of might and other strains of woe which now seem woe compared with loss of thee will not seem so 155 xi they that have power to hurt and will do none that do not do the thing they most do show who moving others are themselves as stone unmovèd cold and to temptation slow they rightly do inherit graces and husband riches from expense they are the lords and owners of their faces others but stewards of their excellence the flower is to the summer sweet though to itself it only live and die but if that flower with base infection meet the basest weed outbraves his dignity for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds 156 xii how like a winter hath my absence from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year what freezings have i felt what dark days seen what old bareness everywhere and yet this time removed was time the teeming autumn big with rich increase bearing the wanton burden of the like wombs after their decease yet this abundant issue to but hope of orphans and fruit for summer and his pleasures wait on thee and thou away the very birds are mute or if they sing with so dull a that leaves look pale dreading the near 157 xiii from you have i been absent in the spring when proud pied april in all his trim hath put a spirit of youth in everything that heavy saturn and with him yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet of different flowers in odour and in hue could make me any story tell or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew nor did i wonder at the white nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose they were but sweet but figures of delight drawn after you you pattern of all those yet it winter still and you away as with your shadow i with these did play 158 xiv my love is though more weak in seeming i love not less though less the show appear that love is merchandised whose rich the tongue doth publish everywhere our love was new and then but in the spring when i was wont to greet it with my lays as philomel in front doth and stops her pipe in growth of riper days not that the summer is less pleasant than when her mournful hymns did hush the night but that wild music burthens every bough and sweets grown common lose their dear delight therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue because i would not dull you with my song 159 xv to me fair friend you never can be old for as you were when first your eye i eyed such seems your beauty still three winters have from the forests shook three pride three beauteous springs to yellow autumn in process of the seasons have i seen three april perfumes in three hot junes since first i saw you fresh which yet are green ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand steal from his figure and no pace perceived so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand hath motion and mine eye may be deceived for fear of which hear this thou age unbred ere you were born was summer dead 160 xvi when in the chronicle of wasted i see descriptions of the fairest wights and beauty making beautiful old in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights then in the blazon of sweet best of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow i see their antique pen would have even such a beauty as you master now so all their praises are but of this our time all you prefiguring and for they but with divining eyes they had not skill enough your worth to sing for we which now behold these present days have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise 161 xvii o never say that i was false of heart though absence my flame to qualify as easy might i from myself depart as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie that is my home of love if i have ranged like him that travels i return again just to the time not with the time exchanged so that myself bring water for my stain never believe though in my nature all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood that it could so be to leave for nothing all thy sum of good for nothing this wide universe i call save thou my rose in it thou art my all 162 xviii let me not to the marriage of true admit impediments love is not which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove o no it is an ever fixèd mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken it is the star to every bark whose unknown although his height be taken not fool though rosy lips and within his bending compass come love alters not with his brief hours and weeks but bears it out even to the edge of doom if this be error and upon me proved i never writ nor no man ever loved 163 xix expense of spirit in a waste of is lust in action and till action is perjured murderous bloody full of blame savage extreme rude cruel not to trust no sooner but despisèd straight past reason hunted and no sooner had past reason hated as a on purpose laid to make the taker mad mad in pursuit and in possession so had having and in quest to have extreme a bliss in proof and proved a very woe before a joy proposed behind a dream all this the world well knows yet none knows to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell 164 xx poor soul

to make dreams truths and fables histories enter these arms for since thou it not to dream all my dream act the rest as lightning or a light thine eyes and not thy noise waked me yet i thought thee for thou truth an angel at first sight but when i saw thou my heart and my thoughts beyond an art when thou what i dreamt when thou excess of joy would wake me and then i must confess it could not choose but profane to think thee anything but thee coming and staying thee thee but rising makes me doubt that thou art not thou that love is weak where as strong as he not all spirit pure and if

falero lero loo her hair like gold did glister each eye was like a star she did surpass her sister which all others far she would me honey call o kiss me too but now alas left me falero lero loo many a merry my love and i have had she was my only sweeting she made my heart full glad the tears stood in her like to the morning dew but now alas left me falero lero loo her cheeks were like the cherry her skin was white as snow when she was blithe and she angel like did show her waist exceeding small the fives did fit her shoe but now alas left me falero lero loo in summer time or she had her desire i still did scorn to stint from sugar sack or fire the world went round about no cares we ever knew but now alas left me falero lero loo to vows and henceforth no credit give you may give them the hearing but never them believe they are as false as fair unconstant frail untrue for mine alas hath left me falero lero loo 237 the resolution shall i wasting in despair die because a fair or make pale my cheeks with rosy are be she fairer than the day or the meads in may if she think not well of me what care i how fair she be shall my silly heart be i see a woman kind or a well disposèd joinèd with a lovely feature be she meeker kinder turtle dove or pelican if she be not so to me what care i how kind she be shall a virtues me to perish for her love or her well deservings make me quite forget my own be she with that goodness which may merit name of best if she be not such to me what care i how good she be her fortune seems too high shall i play the fool and die she that bears a noble mind if not outward helps she find thinks what with them he would that without them dares her woo and unless that mind i see what care i how great she be great or good or kind or fair i will the more despair if she love me this believe i will die ere she shall grieve if she slight me when i woo i can scorn and let her go for if she be not for me what care i for whom she be 238 the choice me so oft my fancy here and there that i where to place desire so that range it might no more but as he that passeth where in all her jollity riches in a do in seemly order grow and a thousand flowers bending as to kiss his hand out of which delightful one he may take and no more long he pausing doubteth of those fair ones he should gather first the primrose courts his eyes then the cowslip he espies next the pansy seems to woo him then carnations bow unto him which whilst that from the stalk intends to strain as half fearing to be seen prettily her leaves peeps the violet pale to that her virtues slighted be which so much his liking that to seize her he begins yet before he so he his wanton eye did on a stem that grew more high and the rose did there espy who beside her previous scent to procure his eyes did display her goodly breast where he found at full all the good that nature on a thousand other flowers wherewith he affected takes it his belovèd flower he makes it and without desire of walks through all he saw before so i but through the garden of this isle saw rich beauties i confess and in number numberless yea so differing lovely too that i had a world to ere i could set up my rest where to choose and choose the best thus i fondly till which i must confess in did a greater favour to than the world can malice do me to me that matchless flower subject for this song of our whose perfection having eyed reason instantly that desire which ranged abroad there would find a period and no marvel if it might for it there hath all delight and in her hath nature what each several fair one graced let who list for me the admirèd flowers of france let who will praise and the reservèd marigold let the sweet violet unto whom she pleaseth bow and the fairest lily where she will her golden head i have such a flower to that for those i do not care let the young and happy playing on the britain court unblamed their shepherdesses and with their gold curlèd toy uncensured until grudge at their prosperity let all times both present past and the age that shall be last vaunt the beauties they bring forth i have found in one such worth that content i neither what the best before me were nor desire to live and who shall fair hereafter be for i know the hand of will not make a fairer creature 239 a hymn how near me came the hand of death when at my side he struck my dear and took away the precious which my belovèd peer how helpless am i thereby made by day how grieved by night how sad and now my delight is gone alas how am i left alone the voice which i did more than music in her sweetest key those eyes which unto me did more comfortable than the day those now by me as they have been shall never more be heard or seen but what i once in shall seem hereafter as a dream 239 peer companion lord keep me faithful to the which my dear spouse reposed in me to him now dead preserve me in all that should performèd be for though our being man and extendeth only to this life yet neither life nor death should the being of a faithful friend browne of 240 a welcome welcome welcome do i sing far more welcome than the spring he that parteth from you never shall enjoy a spring for ever he that to the voice is breaking from your pale need not walk abroad to the delightful nightingale welcome welcome then he that looks still on your eyes though the winter have to benumb our arteries shall not want the sun welcome welcome then he that still may see your cheeks where all rareness still reposes is a fool if he other lilies other roses welcome welcome then he to whom your soft lip yields and perceives your breath in kissing all the odours of the never never shall be missing welcome welcome then he that question would what fair eden was of old let him rightly study you and a brief of that behold welcome welcome then 241 the song steer hither steer your wingèd pines all beaten mariners here lie mines a prey to passengers perfumes far sweeter than the which make the urn and nest fear not your ships nor any to oppose you save our lips but come on shore where no joy dies till love hath gotten more for swelling waves our panting breasts where never storms arise exchange and be awhile our guests for stars gaze on our eyes the compass love shall hourly sing and as he goes about the ring we will not to tell each point he nameth with a kiss then come on shore where no joy dies till love hath gotten more 242 the rose a rose as fair as ever saw the north grew in a little garden all alone a sweeter flower did nature put forth nor fairer garden yet was never known the maidens danced about it morn and noon and learnèd bards of it their ditties made the nimble fairies by the pale faced the root and her pretty shade but well a day the gardener careless grew the maids and fairies both were kept away and in a drought the caterpillars themselves upon the bud and every spray god shield the stock if heaven send no supplies the fairest blossom of the garden dies 243 song for her gait if she be walking be she sitting i desire for her sake and admire for her wit if she be talking gait and state and wit approve her for which all and each i love her be she sullen i commend for a modest be she merry for a kind one her prefer i briefly everything doth lend so much grace and so approve her that for everything i love her 244 memory so shuts the marigold her at the departure of the sun so from the honeysuckle the bee goes when the day is done so sits the turtle when she is but one and so all woe as i since she is gone to some few birds kind nature made all the summer as one day which once cold as night they sleeping pass away those happy creatures are that know not the pain to be deprived or to forget i oft have heard men say there some that with confidence the helpful art of memory but could they teach forgetfulness learn and try what further art could to make me love her and forget her too epitaphs 245 in obitum m s xº maij 1614 may be thou never graced with birds that sing nor pride in thee all flowers and roses spring mine only died 246 on the countess dowager of pembroke underneath this sable lies the subject of all verse sister mother death ere thou hast slain fair and and good as she time shall throw a dart at thee 247 going a maying get up get up for shame the blooming upon her wings presents the god unshorn see how aurora throws her fresh quilted colours through the air get up sweet slug a bed and the dew bespangling herb and tree each flower has wept and toward the above an hour since yet you not drest nay not so much as out of bed when all the birds have matins and sung their thankful hymns sin nay profanation to keep in whereas a thousand virgins on this spring sooner than the lark to fetch in may rise and put on your foliage and be to come forth like the spring time fresh and green and sweet as flora take no for jewels for your gown or hair fear not the leaves will gems in abundance upon you besides the childhood of the day has kept against you come some orient pearls unwept come and receive them while the hangs on the dew locks of the night and titan on the eastern retires himself or else stands till you come forth wash dress be brief in praying few beads are best when once we go a maying come my corinna come and coming how each field turns a street each street a park made green and with trees see devotion gives each house a or branch each porch each door ere this an ark a tabernacle is made up of white thorn neatly interwove as if here were those cooler shades of love can such delights be in the and open fields and we not come abroad and the proclamation made for may and sin no more as we have done by staying but my corinna come go a maying not a budding boy or girl this but is got up and gone to bring in may a deal of youth ere this is back and with white thorn laden home some have their cakes and cream before that we have left to dream and some have wept and and plighted troth and chose their priest ere we can cast off sloth beads prayers many a green gown has been given many a kiss both odd and even many a glance too has been from out the eye firmament many a jest told of the keys this night and locks yet not a maying come let us go while we are in our prime and take the harmless folly of the time we shall grow old apace and before we know our liberty our life is short and our days as fast away as does the sun and as a vapour or a drop of rain once lost can be found again so when or you or i are a fable song or fleeting shade all love all liking all lies with us in endless night then while time serves and we are but decaying come my corinna come go a maying 247 green gown tumble on the grass 248 to the virgins to make much of time gather ye rosebuds while ye may old time is still a flying and this same flower that smiles to to morrow will be dying the glorious lamp of heaven the sun the higher a getting the sooner will his race be run and nearer to setting that age is best which is the first when youth and blood are warmer but being spent the worse and times still succeed the former then be not coy but use your time and while ye may go marry for having lost but once your prime you may for ever tarry 249 to the western wind sweet western wind whose luck it is made rival with the air to give lip a kiss and fan her wanton hair bring me but one promise thee instead of common showers thy wings shall be by me and all beset with flowers 250 to electra i dare not ask a kiss i dare not beg a smile lest having that or this i might grow proud the while no no the utmost of my desire shall only to kiss that that lately kissèd thee 251 to violets welcome maids of honour you do in the spring and wait upon her she has virgins many fresh and fair yet you more sweet than any the maiden posies and so to be damask roses yet though thus respected by and ye do lie poor girls neglected 252 to daffodils fair daffodils we weep to you haste away so soon as yet the early rising has not his noon stay until the hasting has but to the evensong and having together will go with you along we have short time to stay as you we have as short a spring as quick a growth to meet decay as you or anything we as your hours do and like to the rain or as the pearls of dew to be found again 253 to blossoms fair pledges of a fruitful tree why do ye fall so fast your date is not so but you may stay yet here to blush and gently smile and go at last what were ye born to an hour or delight and so to bid good night pity nature brought you merely to show your and lose you quite but you are lovely leaves where may read how soon things their end though so brave and after they have shown their like you awhile they into the grave 254 the primrose ask me why i send you this sweet infanta of the year ask me why i send to this primrose thus with dew i will whisper to your ears the sweets of love are with tears ask me why this flower does so yellow green and sickly too ask me why the stalk is and bending yet it doth not break i will answer these what fainting hopes are in a lover 255 the funeral rites of the rose the rose was sick and smiling died and being to be sanctified about the bed there sighing the sweet and flowery sisterhood some hung the head while some did bring to wash her water from the spring some laid her forth while others wept but all a solemn fast there kept the holy sisters some among the sacred dirge and trental sung but ah what sweets smelt everywhere as heaven had spent all perfumes there at last when prayers for the and rites were all accomplishèd they weeping spread a lawny loom and closed her up as in a tomb 255 trental services for the dead of thirty masses 256 cherry ripe cherry ripe ripe ripe i cry full and fair ones come and buy if so be you ask me they do grow i answer where my lips do smile the land or cherry isle whose plantations fully all the year where cherries grow 257 a meditation for his mistress you are a tulip seen to day but dearest of so short a that where you grew scarce man can say you are a lovely july flower yet one rude wind or ruffling will force you hence and in an hour you are a sparkling rose bud yet lost ere that chaste flesh and can show where you or grew or stood you are a full spread fair set vine and can with tendrils love entwine yet dried ere you distil your wine you are like balm enclosèd in amber or some crystal shell yet lost ere you transfuse your smell you are a dainty violet yet withered ere you can be within the coronet you are the queen all flowers among but die you must fair maid ere long as he the maker of this song 258 delight in disorder a sweet disorder in the kindles in clothes a wantonness a lawn about the shoulders into a fine distraction an erring lace which here and enthrals the crimson stomacher a cuff neglectful and ribbands to flow confusedly a winning wave deserving note in the tempestuous petticoat a careless shoe string in whose i see a wild civility do more bewitch me than when is too precise in every part 259 upon clothes whenas in silks my julia goes then then methinks how sweetly the liquefaction of her clothes next when i cast mine eyes and that brave vibration each way free o how that glittering taketh me 260 the bracelet to julia why i tie about thy wrist julia this silken twist for what other reason but to show thee how in part thou my pretty captive art but thy bond slave is my heart but silk that bindeth thee knap the thread and thou art free but otherwise with me i am bound and fast bound that from thee i cannot go if i could i would not so 261 to daisies not to shut so soon shut not so soon the dull eyed has not as yet to make a seizure on the light or to seal up the sun no marigolds yet closèd are no shadows great appear nor doth the early shine like a spangle here stay but till my julia her life begetting eye and let the whole world then itself to live or die 262 the night piece to julia her eyes the glow worm lend thee the shooting stars attend thee and the elves also whose little eyes like the sparks of fire befriend thee no will the wisp mislight thee nor snake or slow worm bite thee but on on thy not making a stay since ghost none to affright thee let not the dark thee cumber what though the moon does slumber the stars of the will lend thee their like tapers clear without number then julia let me woo thee thus thus to come unto me and when i shall thy feet my soul pour into thee 263 to music to becalm his fever charm me asleep and melt me with thy delicious numbers that being hence i away in easy slumbers ease my sick head and make my bed thou power that canst from me this ill and quickly still though thou not my fever thou sweetly canst convert the from a consuming into a gentle licking flame and make it thus expire then make me my pains asleep and give me such that i poor i may think i live and roses fall on me like the silent dew or like those maiden which by the peep of day do a baptism the flowers melt melt my with thy soft strains that having ease me given with full i leave this light and take my for heaven 264 to dianeme sweet be not proud of those two which starlike sparkle in their skies nor be you proud that you can all hearts your captives yours yet free be you not proud of that rich which wantons with the love sick air whenas that ruby which you wear sunk from the tip of your soft ear will last to be a precious when all your world of gone 265 to œnone what conscience say is it in thee when i a heart had one to take away that heart from me and to retain thy own for shame or pity now to play a loving part either to send me kindly thine or give me back my heart covet not both but if thou resolve to part with neither why yet to show that thou art just take me and mine together 266 to anthea who may command him anything bid me to live and i will thy protestant to be or bid me love and i will a loving heart to thee a heart as soft a heart as kind a heart as sound and as in the whole world thou canst find that heart give to thee bid that heart stay and it will to honour thy decree or bid it languish quite away shall do so for thee bid me to weep and i will while i have eyes to see and having none yet will i a heart to weep for thee bid me despair and under that cypress tree or bid me die and i will death to die for thee thou art my life my love my heart the very eyes of me and hast command of every to live and die for thee 267 to the willow tree thou art to all lost love the best the only true plant found wherewith young men and maids distrest and left of love are when once the rose is dead or laid aside forlorn then willow garlands the with tears are worn when with neglect the bane poor maids rewarded for their love lost their only is but a wreath from thee and underneath thy cooling shade when weary of the light the love spent youth and love sick come to weep out the night 268 the mad song good morrow to the day so fair good morning sir to you good morrow to mine own torn bedabbled with the dew good morning to this primrose too good morrow to each that will with flowers the tomb wherein my love is laid ah woe is me woe woe is me alack and well a day for pity sir find out that which bore my love away seek him in your bonnet brave seek him in your eyes nay now i think made his bed of strawberries seek him there i know ere the cold cold earth doth shake him but i will go or send a by you sir to awake him pray hurt him not though he be dead he knows well who do love him and who with green turfs rear his head and who do rudely move him soft and tender pray take heed with bands of cowslips bind him and bring him home but that i shall never find him 269 comfort to a youth that had lost his love what needs complaints when she a has with the of saints in endless she thinks not said or in earth she sees no tears or any of thy deep she hears nor does she or think that ever wast kind but changed above she likes not there as she did here thy love forbear therefore and lull thy woes and no more 270 to meadows ye have been fresh and green ye have been with flowers

chaste desires that never into unruly heats witness that which in thy bosom his whole rest no default in us i dare thy maiden faith thy purpose fair and as thy pure self cross planets did us to each

grieved friend whom thou quite melted into tears for thee dear loss since thy untimely fate my task hath been to on thee on thee thou art the book the library whereon i look almost blind for thee loved clay i languish out not live the day thou hast benighted me thy this eve of blackness did beget who wast my day before thou hadst thy noontide past and i remember must in thou scarce hadst seen so many as day tells hours by thy clear my love and fortune first did run but thou wilt never more folded within my hemisphere since both thy light and motion like a fled star is and gone and me and my dear the earth now interposèd is i could allow thee for a to darken me and my sad clime were it a month a year or ten i would thy exile live till then and all that space my mirth adjourn so thou wouldst promise to return and putting off thy ashy at length disperse this cloud but woe is me the longest too narrow is to these empty hopes never shall be so much blest as to a glimpse of thee till that day which shall the earth to cinders doom and a fierce fever must the body of this world like thine my little world that fit of once off our bodies shall to our bliss then we shall and view

till we shall meet and never part 281 virtue sweet day so cool so calm so bright the bridal of the earth and sky the dew shall weep thy fall to night for thou must die sweet rose whose hue angry and bids the rash gazer wipe his eye thy root is ever in its grave and thou must die sweet spring full of sweet days and roses a box where sweets compacted lie my music shows ye have your closes and all must die only a sweet and virtuous soul like timber never gives but though the whole world turn to coal then chiefly lives 282 easter i got me flowers to straw thy way i got me boughs off many a tree but thou wast up by break of day and thy sweets along with thee yet though my flowers be lost they a heart can never come too late teach it to sing thy praise this day and then this day my life shall date 283 discipline throw away thy rod throw away thy wrath o my god take the gentle path for my unto thine is bent i to a full consent not a word or i affect to own but by book and thy book alone though i fail i weep though i halt in pace yet i to the throne of grace then let wrath remove love will do the deed for with stony hearts will bleed love is swift of foot a man of war and can shoot and can hit from far who can his bow that which wrought on thee brought thee low needs must work on me throw away thy rod though man frailties hath thou art god throw away thy wrath 284 a dialogue man sweetest saviour if my were but worth the having quickly should i then any thought of waving but when all my care and cannot give the name of to thy wretch so full of stains what delight or hope remains saviour what child is the balance thine thine the poise and measure if i say shalt be mine finger not my treasure what the gains in having do amount to only who for man was sold can that accounts to me man but as i can see no leading to this favour so the way to fit me for is beyond my savour as the reason then is thine so the way is none of mine i disclaim the whole design sin disclaims and i resign saviour that is all if that i get without repining and my clay my creature follow my resigning savour savoir knowing that as i did freely with my glory and desert left all joys to feel all smart man ah no more thou my heart 285 the pulley when god at first made man having a glass of blessings standing by let us said he pour on him all we can let the riches which dispersèd lie contract into a span so strength first made a way then beauty then wisdom honour pleasure when almost all was out god made a stay perceiving that alone of all his treasure rest in the bottom lay for if i should said he bestow this jewel also on my creature he would adore my gifts instead of me and rest in nature not the god of nature so both should losers be yet let him keep the rest but keep them with repining restlessness let him be rich and weary that at least if goodness lead him not yet may toss him to my breast 286 love love bade me welcome yet my soul drew back guilty of dust and sin but quick eyed love observing me grow from my first entrance in drew nearer to me sweetly if i anything guest i to be here love said shall be he the unkind ungrateful ah my dear i cannot look on thee love took my hand and smiling did reply made the eyes but i lord but i have them let my go where it doth deserve know you not says love bore the blame dear then i will serve must sit down says

that earth may lessen to our eyes o be not careless then and until the star of hide all his beams in dark recess poor pilgrims needs must lose their way when all the shadows do increase 288 death the leveller the glories of our blood and are shadows not substantial things there is no armour against fate death lays his icy hand on kings sceptre and must tumble down and in the dust be equal with the poor crookèd scythe and spade some men with swords may reap the field and plant fresh laurels where they kill but their strong nerves at last must yield they tame but one another still early or they stoop to fate and must give up their murmuring when they pale captives creep to death the garlands wither on your brow then boast no more your mighty deeds upon purple altar see where the victor victim bleeds your heads must to the cold tomb only the actions of the smell sweet and blossom in their dust 1639 289 song ask me no more where jove bestows when june is past the fading rose for in your orient these flowers as in their causes sleep ask me no more whither do the golden atoms of the day for in pure love heaven did those powders to enrich your hair ask me no more whither doth the nightingale when may is past for in your sweet dividing she winters and keeps warm her note ask me no more where those stars that downwards fall in dead of for in your eyes they sit and fixèd become as in their sphere ask me no more if east or the phœnix builds her spicy nest for unto you at last she flies and in your fragrant bosom dies 290 persuasions to joy a song if the quick spirits in your

wings 291 to his inconstant mistress when thou poor from all the joys of love shalt the full reward and glorious which my strong faith shall purchase me then curse thine own inconstancy a fairer hand than thine shall that heart which thy false oaths did wound and to my soul a soul more than thine shall by hand be bound and both with equal glory then shalt thou weep entreat to love as i did once to thee when all thy tears shall be as as mine were then for thou shalt for thy false apostasy 292 the unfading beauty he that loves a rosy cheek or a coral lip admires or from star like eyes doth fuel to maintain his fires as old time makes these decay so his flames must waste away but a smooth and steadfast mind gentle thoughts and calm desires hearts with equal love combined kindle never dying fires where these are not i lovely cheeks or lips or eyes 293 ingrateful beauty threatened know celia since thou art so proud i that gave thee thy renown thou hadst in the forgotten of common beauties lived unknown had not my verse thy name and with it the wings of fame that killing power is none of thine i gave it to thy voice and eyes thy sweets thy graces all are mine thou art my star in my skies then dart not from thy lightning on him that thee there 293 grafted with new feathers tempt me with such affrights no more lest what i made i uncreate let fools thy mystic form adore i know thee

to our clouded sky lies darkened here for ever set to us by sent to enflame the world beneath but a bud yet did more sweetness than shall spring again a budding star that might have into a sun when it had blown this hopeful beauty did new life in declining state but now his empire ends and from fire and wounding darts are free his brand his bow let no man fear the flames the arrows all lie here 296

every sand of his fleet glass increasing age as it doth pass insensibly sows wrinkles where flowers and roses do appear whilst we do speak our doth into ice expire flames turn to frost and ere we know how our crow turns swan or how a silver springs there where jet did grow our fading spring is in dull winter lost since then the night hath darkness shade over its enemy the day and the just such a blind and shapeless as before light did from darkness spring let us employ its and make shade pleasure number out the hours by blisses and count the minutes by our kisses let the heavens new motions and by our embraces wheel and whilst we try the by which love doth soul unto soul and mingling makes them such raptures as makes them entrancèd in mutual ecstasy let the harmonious spheres in music

rich a perfume do ye yield in some close garden cowslips are sweeter than open field in those white cloisters live from the rude blasts of wanton breath each hour more innocent and pure till you shall wither into death then that which living gave you room your glorious sepulchre shall be there wants no marble for a whose breast hath marble been to me 298 nox nocti indicat scientiam when i survey

forth no so silent but is in speaking the name no unregarded contracts its into so small a character removed far from our human sight but if we steadfast we shall in it as in some holy book how man may heavenly knowledge learn it tells the that far power which his proud dangers traffic for is but the triumph of an hour that from the farthest north some nation may yet issue forth and his new got conquest sway some nation yet shut with hills of may be let out to scourge his sin till they shall equal him in vice and then they likewise their ruin have for as yourselves your empires fall and every kingdom hath a grave thus those celestial fires though seeming mute the fallacy of our and all the pride of life confute for they have since the world had birth and found sin in itself accurst and nothing permanent on earth 299 a devout lover i have a mistress for perfections in every eye but in my thoughts most fair like tapers on the altar shine her eyes her breath is the perfume of sacrifice and wheresoever my fancy would begin still her perfection lets religion in we sit and talk and kiss away the as chastely as the morning dews kiss flowers i touch her like my beads with devout care and come unto my courtship as my prayer 300 an ode to master anthony stafford to hasten him into the country come spur away i have no patience for a longer stay but must go and leave the chargeable noise of this great town i will the country see where old simplicity though hid in gray doth look more than foppery in plush and scarlet clad farewell you city wits that almost at civil war time that i grow wise when all the world grows mad more of my i will not spend to gain an praise or to make for some slight puisne of the inns of court then worthy stafford say how shall we spend the day with what shorten the nights when from this tumult we are got secure where mirth with all her freedom goes yet shall no finger lose where every word is thought and every thought is pure there from the cherries pluck and pick the strawberry and every go see the wholesome country girls make hay whose brown hath lovelier than any painted that i do hyde park can show where i had rather gain a kiss than though some of them in greater might court my love with plate the beauties of the cheap and wives of lombard street but think some other pleasures these to me are none why do i of women that are things against my fate i never mean to that torture to my bed my muse is my love shall be let clowns get wealth and heirs when i am and that great bugbear grisly death shall take this idle breath if i a poem leave that poem is my son of this no more rather taste the bright store no fruit shall our palates from the damson to the grape then full seek a shade and hear what made how her tale doth tell and how the other birds do fill the quire the thrush and blackbird lend their throats warbling melodious notes we will all sports enjoy which others but desire ours is the sky where at what fowl we please our hawk shall fly nor will we to hunt the crafty fox or timorous hare but let our hounds run in any ground choose the buck shall fall the stag and all our pleasures must from their own warrants be for to my muse if not to me sure all game is free heaven earth are all but parts of her great royalty and when we to taste of blessings now and then and drink by a cup or two to noble health take my pipe and the phrygian melody which he that hears lets through his a madness to distemper all the brain then i another pipe will and doric music make to civilize with graver notes our

she can dress her beauty at your eyes the merchant bows unto the star the ploughman from the sun his season takes but still the lover wonders what they who look for day before his mistress wakes awake awake break your veils of lawn then draw your curtains and begin the dawn 302 to a mistress dying lover your beauty ripe and calm and as eastern summers are must now forsaking time and flesh add light to some small star philosopher whilst she yet lives were stars their light by hers relief might find but death will lead her to a where love is cold and beauty blind lover lovers whose priests all poets are think every mistress when she dies is changed at least into a star and who dares doubt the poets wise philosopher but ask not bodies to to what abode they go since knowledge is but spy it is not safe to know 303 praise and prayer praise is devotion fit for mighty minds the agreeing sacrifice where heaven divided faiths united finds but prayer in various discord upward flies for prayer the ocean is where men steer their course each to a coast where all our interests so discordant that half beg winds by which the rest are lost by penitence when we ourselves forsake but in wise design on piteous heaven in praise we nobly give what god may take and are without a blush forgiven 304 on a girdle that which her slender waist shall now my joyful temples bind no monarch but would give his

the light retired bid her come forth suffer herself to be desired and not blush so to be admired then die that the common fate of all things may read in thee how small a part of time they that are so wondrous sweet and fair 306 old age the seas are quiet when the winds give so calm are we when passions are no more for then we know how vain it was to of fleeting things so certain to be lost clouds of affection from our younger conceal that emptiness which age descries the dark cottage and lets in new light through chinks that time hath made stronger by weakness wiser men as they draw near to their eternal home leaving the old both worlds at once they that stand upon the threshold of the new 307 hymn on the morning of nativity it was the winter wilde while the born childe all meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies nature in aw to had her gawdy trim with her great master so to sympathize it was no season then for to wanton with the sun her lusty paramour only with speeches she the gentle to hide her guilty front with innocent snow and on her naked shame pollute with sinfull blame the saintly vail of maiden white to throw confounded that her makers should look so neer upon her foul deformities but he her fears to cease sent down the meek eyd peace she with olive green came softly down through the turning his ready harbinger with turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing and waving wide her mirtle wand she strikes a universall peace through sea and land no war or battails was heard the world around the idle spear and shield were high up hung the hookèd chariot with hostile blood the trumpet spake not to the armèd throng and kings sate still with awfull eye as if they surely knew their sovran lord was by but peacefull was the wherin the prince of his raign of peace upon the earth began the windes with wonder whist smoothly the waters kist whispering new joyes to the milde ocean who now hath quite forgot to rave while birds of calm sit brooding on the charmèd wave the stars with deep stand fixt in stedfast gaze bending one way their pretious influence and will not take their flight for all the morning light or lucifer that often them thence but in their glimmering orbs did glow untill their lord himself bespake and bid them go and though the shady had given day her room the sun himself with held his wonted speed and hid his head for shame as his inferiour flame the new world no more should need he saw a greater sun then his bright throne or burning axletree could bear the shepherds on the lawn or ere the point of dawn sate simply chatting in a rustick row full little thought they than that the mighty was kindly com to live with them below perhaps their loves or els their sheep was all that did their silly thoughts so busie keep when such musick their hearts and ears did greet as never was by mortall finger strook divinely warbled answering the stringèd noise as all their souls in blisfull rapture the air such pleasure loth to lose with thousand still prolongs each close nature that heard such beneath the hollow of seat the airy region thrilling now was almost to think her part was don and that her raign had here its last fulfilling she knew such harmony could hold all and earth in happier union at last surrounds their a globe of circular light that with long beams the shame night the helmèd and sworded seraphim are seen in glittering ranks with wings displaid harping in loud and solemn quire with unexpressive notes to new born heir such musick as said before was never made but when of old the sons of morning sung while the creator his constellations set and the well world on hinges hung and cast the dark foundations deep and bid the weltring waves their oozy channel keep ring out ye crystall sphears once bless our human ears if ye have power to touch our senses so and let your silver move in melodious time and let the base of deep organ and with your ninefold make up full consort to symphony for if such holy enwrap our fancy long time will run back and fetch the age of gold and will sicken soon and die and leprous sin will melt from earthly mould and hell it self will pass away and leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day yea truth and justice will down return to men arras of the rain bow wearing and mercy set between in celestiall sheen with radiant feet the tissued clouds down stearing and as at som festivall will open wide the gates of her high palace hall but wisest fate sayes no this must not yet be so the babe lies yet in smiling infancy that on the bitter must redeem our loss so both himself and us to glorifie yet first to those in sleep the wakefull trump of doom must thunder through the deep with such a horrid as on mount sinai while the red fire and smouldring clouds out brake the agèd earth with terrour of that blast shall from the surface to the center shake when at the worlds last session the dreadfull judge in middle air shall spread his throne and then at last our full and perfect is but now begins for from this happy dragon under in straiter limits bound not half so far casts his usurpèd sway and wrath to see his kingdom fail swindges the scaly horrour of his foulded tail the oracles are dumm no voice or hideous runs through the archèd roof in words deceiving apollo from his can no more divine with hollow shreik the steep of delphos leaving no nightly trance or breathèd spell the pale priest from the prophetic cell the lonely mountains and the resounding shore a voice of weeping heard and loud lament from haunted spring and with poplar pale the parting genius is with sighing sent with flowre tresses the nimphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn in consecrated earth and on the holy hearth the lars and lemures moan with midnight plaint in urns and altars round a drear and dying affrights the flamins at their service quaint and the chill marble seems to sweat while each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat peor and baalim forsake their temples dim with that twise god of palestine and moonèd ashtaroth queen and mother both now sits not girt with tapers holy shine the libyc hammon shrinks his horn in vain the tyrian maids their wounded thamuz mourn and sullen moloch fled hath left in shadows dred his burning idol all of blackest hue in vain with cymbals ring they call the grisly king in dismall dance about the furnace blue the brutish gods of nile as fast isis and orus and the dog anubis hast nor is osiris in memphian grove or green trampling the grasse with lowings loud nor can he be at within his sacred chest naught

pillows his chin upon an orient wave the flocking shadows pale troop to jail each ghost slips to his severall grave and the yellow skirted fayes fly after the night steeds leaving their moon maze but see the virgin blest hath laid her babe to rest time is our tedious song should here have ending youngest teemèd star hath fixt her polisht car her sleeping lord with handmaid lamp attending and all

plummets pace and glut thy self with what thy womb devours which is no more then what is false and vain and meerly mortal dross so little is our loss so little is thy gain for when as each thing bad thou hast and last of all thy greedy self then long eternity shall greet our with an individual kiss and joy shall overtake us as a flood when every thing that is sincerely and perfectly divine with truth and peace and love shall ever about the supreme of him happy making sight alone when once our guided soul shall clime then all this earthy grosnes quit with stars we shall for ever sit

bright seraphim in burning their loud up lifted angel trumpets blow and the cherubick host in thousand touch their immortal harps of golden wires with those just spirits that wear victorious palms hymns devout and holy singing everlastingly that we on earth with undiscording may rightly answer that melodious noise as once we did till against natures chime and with harsh broke the fair musick

undertook to what death with love should have to do nor has she yet why to show love she should shed blood yet though she cannot tell you why she can love and she can die scarce has she blood enough

something liker death possest my eyes with tears did uncommanded flow and on my soul hung the dull of some intolerable fate what bell was that ah me too much i know my sweet companion and my gentle peer why hast thou left me thus unkindly here thy end for ever and my life to moan o thou hast left me all alone thy soul and body when besieged around thy noble heart did not with more reluctance than i my dearest friend do part from thee my dearest friend would i had died for thee life and this world henceforth will tedious be nor shall i know hereafter what to if once my griefs prove tedious too silent and sad i walk about all day as sullen ghosts stalk speechless where their hid treasures lie alas my gone why do i stay say for you saw us ye immortal lights how oft unwearied have we spent the nights till the ledæan stars so famed for love at us from above we spent them not in toys in lusts or wine but search of deep philosophy wit eloquence and poetry arts which i loved for they my friend were thine ye fields of cambridge our dear cambridge have ye not seen us walking every day was there a tree about which did not the love betwixt us two henceforth ye gentle trees for ever fade or your sad branches thicker and into darksome shades combine dark as the grave wherein my friend is laid large was his soul as large a soul as submitted to inform a body here high as the place shortly in heaven to have but low and humble as his grave so high that all the virtues there did come as to their chiefest conspicuous and great so low that for me too it made a room knowledge he only sought and so soon as if for him knowledge had rather sought nor did more learning ever crowded in such a short mortality the skilful youth discoursed or writ still did the notions about his eloquent tongue nor could his ink flow faster than his wit his mirth was the pure spirits of various wit yet never did his god or friends forget and when deep talk and wisdom came in view retired and gave to them their due for the rich help of books he always took though his own searching mind was so with notions written as if wise nature had made that her book with as much zeal devotion piety he always lived as other saints do die still with his soul severe account he kept weeping all debts out ere he slept then down in peace and innocence he lay like the laborious light which still in water sets at night unsullied with his journey of the day but happy thou from this frantic age where ignorance and hypocrisy does rage a fitter time for heaven no soul chose the place now only free from those there the blest thou dost for ever shine and thou casts thy upon that white and radiant crew not a soul clothed with more light than thine 353 the wish well then i now do plainly this busy world and i shall agree the very honey of all earthly does of all meats the soonest cloy and they methinks deserve my who for it can endure the stings the crowd and buzz and murmurings of this great hive the city ah yet ere i descend to the may i a small house and large garden have and a few friends and many books both true both wise and both delightful too and since love will from me flee a mistress moderately fair and good as guardian angels are only beloved and loving me o fountains when in you shall myself eased of unpeaceful thoughts espy o fields o woods when when shall i be the happy tenant of your shade the spring head of flood wealthy treasury where all the riches lie that has and for good pride and ambition only in far metaphors appear here nought but winds can hurtful murmurs scatter and nought but echo flatter the gods when they descended from heaven did always choose their way and therefore we may boldly that the way too thither how happy here should and one dear she live and embracing die she who is all the world and can in deserts solitude i should have then this only fear lest men when they my pleasures see should hither throng to live like me and so make a city here 354 the resolve tell me not of a face fair nor lip and cheek red nor of the tresses of her hair nor curls in order laid nor of a rare seraphic that like an angel sings though if i were to take my i would have all these things but if that thou wilt have me love and it must be a she the only argument can is that she will love me the glories of your ladies but metaphors of things and but resemble what we each common object brings roses out red their lips and cheeks lilies their whiteness stain what fool is he that shadows and may the substance gain then if have me love a lass let it be one

how the flowers as at parade under their colours stand each regiment in order grows that of the tulip pink and rose but when the vigilant of stars walks round about the pole their leaves that to the stalks are seem to their staves the ensigns then in some belovèd each bee as sentinel is shut and sleeps so too but if once she runs you through nor asks the word o thou that dear and happy isle the garden of the world erewhile thou paradise of the four which heaven planted us to please but to exclude the world did with if not flaming sword what luckless apple did we to make us mortal and thee waste unhappy shall we never that sweet militia restore when gardens only had their towers and all the garrisons were flowers when roses only arms might bear and men did rosy garlands wear 357 to his coy mistress had we but world enough and time this coyness lady were no we would sit down and think which to walk and pass our long day thou by the indian shouldst rubies find i by the of humber would complain i love you ten years before the flood and you should if you please till the conversion of the jews my vegetable love should vaster than empires and more slow an hundred years should go to thine eyes and on thy forehead gaze two hundred to adore each breast but thirty thousand to the rest an age at least to every part and the last age should show your heart for lady you deserve this state nor would i love at lower rate but at my back i always winged chariot hurrying near and yonder all before us deserts of vast eternity thy beauty shall no more be found nor in thy marble vault shall my echoing song then worms shall that long preserved virginity and your quaint honour turn to dust and into ashes all my lust the a fine and private place but none i think do there embrace now therefore while the youthful sits on thy skin like morning dew and while thy willing soul at every pore with instant fires now let us sport us while we may and now like amorous birds of prey rather at once our time than languish in his slow chapt power let us roll all our strength and our sweetness up into one ball and tear our pleasures with rough thorough the iron gates of life thus though we cannot make our stand still yet we will make him run slow chapt slow jawed slowly devouring 358 the picture of little t c in a prospect of flowers see with what this nymph begins her golden days in the green grass she loves to lie and there with her fair aspect the wilder flowers and gives them names but only with the roses plays and them does what colour best becomes them and what smell who can foretell for what high this darling of the gods was born yet this is she whose chaster the wanton love shall one day fear and under her command severe see his bow broke and ensigns torn happy who appease this virtuous enemy of man o then let me in time and parley with those conquering eyes ere they have tried their force to wound ere with their glancing wheels they in triumph over hearts that strive and them that yield but more despise let me be laid where i may see the glories from some shade meantime whilst every verdant itself does at thy beauty charm reform the errors of the spring make that the tulips may have of sweetness seeing they are fair and roses of their thorns disarm but most that violets may a longer age endure but o young beauty of the woods whom nature courts with fruits and flowers gather the flowers but spare the buds lest flora angry at thy to kill her infants in their prime do quickly make example yours and ere we see nip in the blossom all our hopes and thee 359 thoughts in a garden how vainly men themselves to win the palm the oak or bays and their uncessant labours from some single herb or tree whose short and narrow vergèd does prudently their toils upbraid while all the flowers and trees do to weave the garlands of repose fair quiet have i found thee here and innocence thy sister dear mistaken long i sought you in busy companies of men your sacred plants if here below only among the plants will grow society is all but to this delicious solitude no white nor red was ever so amorous as this lovely green fond lovers cruel as their flame cut in these trees their name little alas they know or how far these beauties hers exceed fair trees your barks i wound no name shall but your own be found when we have run our heat love hither makes his best retreat the gods that mortal beauty chase still in a tree did end their race apollo hunted daphne only that she might laurel grow and pan did after syrinx not as a nymph but for a reed what wondrous life in this i lead ripe apples drop about my head the luscious clusters of the upon my mouth do crush their wine the nectarine and curious into my hands themselves do reach stumbling on melons as i pass ensnared with flowers i fall on grass meanwhile the mind from pleasure withdraws into its happiness the mind that ocean where each does straight its own resemblance find yet it creates transcending these far other worlds and other seas annihilating all to a green thought in a green shade here at the sliding foot or at some fruit mossy root casting the vest aside my soul into the boughs does glide there like a bird it sits and sings then whets and combs its silver wings and till prepared for longer flight waves in its plumes the various light such was that happy garden while man there without a mate after a place so pure and sweet what other help could yet be meet but beyond a to wander solitary there two paradises in one to live in paradise alone how well the skilful of flowers and herbs this dial new where from above the milder does through a fragrant zodiac run and as it works industrious computes its time as well as we how could such sweet and wholesome be but with herbs and flowers 360 bermudas where the remote bermudas in the bosom unespied from a small boat that the listening woods received this song should we do but sing his that led us through the watery unto an isle so long unknown and yet far kinder than our own where he the huge sea monsters wracks that lift the deep upon their backs he lands us on a grassy stage safe from the and rage he gave us this eternal which here enamels everything and sends the fowls to us in on daily visits through the air he hangs in shades the orange like golden lamps in a green night and does in the pomegranates jewels more rich than ormus shows he makes the figs our mouths to and throws the melons at our feet but apples plants of such a price no tree could ever bear them twice with cedars chosen by his from lebanon he stores the land and makes the hollow seas that proclaim the ambergris on shore he cast of which we rather boast the pearl upon our coast and in these rocks for us did a temple where to sound his name o let our voice his praise till it arrive at vault which thence perhaps rebounding echo beyond the mexique bay thus sung they in the english a holy and a cheerful note and all the way to guide their chime with falling oars they kept the time 361 an epitaph enough and leave the rest to fame to commend her but to name courtship which living she declined when dead to offer were unkind nor can the truest wit or friend without detracting her commend to say she lived a virgin in this age loose and all unlaced nor was when vice is so allowed of virtue or ashamed or proud that her soul was on heaven so bent no minute but it came and went that ready her last debt to pay she her life up every day modest as morn as mid day bright gentle as evening cool as night true but all too weakly said more significant dead 362 the retreat happy those early days when in my angel infancy before i understood this appointed for my second race or taught my soul to fancy but a white celestial thought when yet i had not a mile or two from my first love and looking back at that short space could see a glimpse of his bright face when on some gilded cloud or my gazing soul would dwell an hour and in those weaker glories some shadows of eternity before i taught my tongue to my conscience with a sinful sound or had the black art to a several sin to sense but felt through all this fleshly bright shoots of everlastingness o how i long to travel back and tread again that ancient track that i might once more reach that where first i left my glorious train from whence enlightned spirit that shady city of palm trees but ah my soul with too much is drunk and staggers in the way some men a forward motion love but i by backward steps would move and when this dust falls to the urn in that state i came return 363 peace my soul there is a far beyond the stars where stands a wingèd all skilful in the wars there above noise and danger sweet peace sits with smiles and one born in a commands the beauteous files he is thy gracious friend and o my soul awake did in pure love to die here for thy sake if thou canst get but thither there grows the flower of peace the rose that cannot wither thy fortress and thy ease leave then thy foolish ranges for none can thee but one who never changes thy god thy life thy cure 364 the timber sure thou didst flourish once and many springs many bright mornings much dew many showers thy head many light hearts and wings which now are dead in thy living bowers and still a new succession sings and flies fresh groves grow up and their green branches towards the old and still enduring skies while the low violet thrives at their root but thou beneath the sad and heavy of death doth waste all senseless cold and dark where not so much as dreams of light may shine nor any thought of greenness leaf or bark and yet as if some deep hate and dissent bred in thy growth betwixt high winds and thee were still alive thou dost great storms before they come and how near they be else all at rest thou liest and the fierce of tempests can no more disturb thy ease but this thy strange resentment after means only those who broke in life thy peace 365 friends departed they are all gone into the world of light and i alone sit here their very memory is fair and bright and my sad thoughts doth clear it glows and glitters in my cloudy breast like stars upon some gloomy grove or those faint beams in which this hill is after the remove i see them walking in an air of glory whose light doth trample on my days my days which are at best but dull and hoary mere glimmering and decays o holy hope and high humility high as the heavens above these are your walks and you have them me to kindle my cold love dear beauteous death the jewel of the just shining nowhere but in the dark what mysteries do lie beyond thy dust could man outlook that mark he that hath found some nest may know at first sight if the bird be flown but what fair well or grove he sings in now that is to him unknown and yet as angels in some brighter call to the soul when man doth sleep so some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes and into glory peep if a star were into a tomb her captive flames must needs burn there but when the hand that her up gives room shine through all the sphere o father of eternal life and created glories under thee resume thy spirit from this world of into true liberty either disperse these mists which blot and my perspective still as they pass or else remove me hence unto that hill where i shall need no glass 366 the shepherd boy sings in the valley of humiliation he that is down needs fear no fall he that is low no pride he that is humble ever have god to be his guide i am content with what i have little be it or much and lord contentment still i crave because thou savest such fullness to such a burden that go on pilgrimage here little and hereafter bliss is best from age to age and songs by unknown

fall like those they sung deaf the praised ear and mute the tuneful tongue he whose soul now melts in mournful lays shall shortly want the tear he pays then from his closing eyes thy form shall part

the echoing horn no more shall rouse them from their lowly bed for them no more the blazing hearth shall burn or busy housewife ply her evening care no children run to lisp their return or climb his knees the envied kiss to share oft did the harvest to their sickle yield their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke how jocund did they drive their team afield how the woods beneath their sturdy

here may rest some cromwell guiltless of his blood applause of senates to command the threats of pain and ruin to despise to scatter plenty a smiling land and read their history in a eyes their lot forbade nor circumscribed their growing virtues but their crimes confined forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne and shut the gates of mercy on mankind the struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide to quench the blushes of ingenuous shame or heap the shrine of luxury and with incense kindled at the flame far from the madding ignoble their sober wishes never to stray along the cool vale

ground where thou art laid when howling winds and beating rain in tempests shake thy sylvan cell or the chase on every plain the tender thought on thee shall dwell each lonely scene shall thee restore

gave it birth and this its sweet returning day buried be all that has been done or say that naught is done amiss for who the dangerous path can in such bewildering world as this but love can every fault forgive or with a tender look reprove and now let naught in memory but that we meet and that we love 481 late wisdom trod the maze of error round long wandering in the winding glade and now the torch of truth is found it only shows us where we strayed by long experience taught we know can rightly judge of friends and foes can all the worth of these allow and all the faults discern in those

earth or the blue regions of the where the melodious winds have birth whether on crystal rocks ye rove beneath the bosom of the sea wandering in many a coral grove fair nine forsaking poetry how have you left the ancient that bards of old in you the languid strings do scarcely move the sound is forced the notes are few 484 to spring o thou with dewy locks who lookest through the clear windows of the morning thine angel eyes upon our western isle which in full choir hails thy approach o spring the hills tell one another and the valleys hear all our longing eyes are up to thy bright pavilions issue and let thy holy feet visit our clime come the eastern hills and let our kiss thy perfumèd garments let us thy morn and evening breath scatter thy upon our lovesick land that mourns for thee o deck her forth with thy fair fingers thy soft kisses on her bosom and thy golden crown upon her head whose modest tresses are bound up for thee 485 song my silks and fine array my smiles and air by love are driven away and mournful lean brings me yew to deck my grave such end true lovers have his face is fair as when springing buds unfold o why to him given whose heart is wintry cold his breast is all tomb where all pilgrims come bring me an axe and spade bring me a winding sheet when i my grave have made let winds and tempests beat then down lie as cold as clay true love doth pass away 486 reeds of innocence piping down the valleys wild piping songs of pleasant glee on a cloud i saw a child and he laughing said to me a song about a lamb so i piped with merry cheer pipe that song again so i piped he wept to hear thy pipe thy happy pipe sing thy songs of happy cheer so i sung the same again while he wept with joy to hear sit thee down and in a book that all may read so he from my sight and i a hollow reed and i made a rural pen and i the water clear and i wrote my happy every child may joy to hear 487 the little black boy my mother bore me in the southern wild and i am black but o my soul is white white as an angel is the english child but i am black as if bereaved of light my mother taught me underneath a tree and sitting down before the heat of day she took me on her lap and kissèd me and pointing to the east began to say at the rising sun there god does live and gives his light and gives his heat away and flowers and trees and beasts and men comfort in morning joy in the noonday we are put on earth a little space that we may learn to bear the beams of love and these black bodies and this sunburnt are but a cloud and like a shady grove when our souls have the heat to bear the cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice saying out from the grove my love and care and round my golden tent like lambs rejoice thus did my mother say and kissèd me and thus i say to little english boy when i from black and he from white cloud free and round the tent of god like lambs we joy shade him from the heat till he can to lean in joy upon our knee and then stand and stroke his silver hair and be like him and he will then love me 488 hear the voice hear the voice of the bard who present past and future sees whose ears have the holy that among the ancient trees calling the lapsèd soul and weeping in the evening dew that might the starry pole and fallen fallen light renew earth o earth return arise from out the dewy grass night is worn and the rises from the slumbrous mass away no more why wilt thou turn away the starry floor the watery shore is given thee till the break of day 489 the tiger tiger tiger burning in the forests of the night what immortal hand or could frame thy fearful symmetry in what distant deeps or burnt the fire of thine eyes on what wings dare he aspire what the hand dare seize the fire and what shoulder and what could twist the sinews of thy heart and when thy heart began to beat what dread hand and what dread feet what the hammer what the chain in what furnace was thy brain what the anvil what dread dare its deadly terrors clasp when the stars threw down their spears and watered heaven with their tears did he smile his work to see did he who made the lamb make thee tiger tiger burning in the forests of the night what immortal hand or dare frame thy fearful symmetry 490 cradle song sleep sleep beauty bright dreaming in the joys of night sleep sleep in thy little sorrows sit and weep sweet babe in thy soft desires i can trace secret joys and secret smiles little pretty infant wiles as thy softest limbs i smiles as of the morning thy cheek and thy where thy little heart doth rest o the cunning wiles that in thy little heart asleep when thy little heart doth wake then the dreadful night shall break 491 night the sun descending in the west the evening star does shine the birds are silent in their nest and i must seek for mine the moon like a in high bower with silent sits and smiles on the night farewell green fields and happy grove where flocks have took delight where lambs have nibbled silent the feet of angels bright unseen they pour and joy without on each bud and blossom on each sleeping bosom they look in every thoughtless where birds are warm they visit caves of every beast to keep them all from harm if they see any that should have been sleeping they pour sleep on their head and sit down by their bed when wolves and tigers howl for prey they pitying stand and weep seeking to drive their thirst and keep them from the sheep but if they rush dreadful the angels most heedful receive each mild spirit new worlds to inherit and there the ruddy shall flow with tears of gold and pitying the tender cries and walking round the fold saying by his meekness and by his health sickness are driven from our immortal day now beside thee bleating lamb i can lie down and sleep or think on him who bore thy name graze after thee and weep for in river my bright mane for shall shine like the as i guard the fold 492 secret never seek to tell thy love love that never told can be for the gentle wind doth silently invisibly i told my love i told my love i told her all my heart trembling cold in ghastly fears ah she did depart soon after she was gone from me a traveller came by silently invisibly

vision and fountain of light the emerald fields were of dazzling glow and the flowers of everlasting blow then deep in the stream her body they laid that her youth and beauty never might fade and they smiled on heaven when they saw her in the stream of life that bye and she heard a song she heard it sung she not where but sae sweetly it rung kyth show appear it fell on the ear like a dream of the morn blest be the day kilmeny was born now shall the land of the spirits see now shall it ken what a woman may be the sun that shines on the world sae bright a gleid frae the fountain of light and the

swift they her through the light like the motion of sound or sight they to split the gales of air and yet nor gale nor breeze was there groves below them grew they came they and backward flew like floods of blossoms gliding on in moment seen in moment gone o never vales to mortal like those which they flew that land to human spirits given the lowermost vales of the storied heaven from thence they can view the world below and blue gates with sapphires glow more glory yet unmeet to know gleid spark glow elyed vanished they bore her far to a mountain green to see what mortal never had seen and they seated her high on a purple sward and bade her heed what she saw and heard and note the changes the spirits wrought for now she lived in the land of thought she and she saw nor sun nor skies but a crystal dome of a thousand dyes she and she saw nae land aright but an endless whirl of glory and light and radiant beings went and came far swifter than wind or the linkèd flame she hid her frae the dazzling view she again and the scene was new she saw a sun on a summer sky and clouds of amber sailing bye a lovely land beneath her lay and that land had glens and mountains gray and that land had valleys and hoary piles and marlèd seas and a thousand isles its fields were speckled its forests and its lakes were all of the dazzling sheen like magic mirrors where slumbering the sun and the sky and the cloudlet gray which heaved and trembled and gently swung on every shore they to be hung for there they were seen on their downward a thousand times and a thousand again in winding lake and placid firth little peaceful heavens in the bosom of earth marlèd variegated parti coloured kilmeny and to grieve for she found her heart to that land did cleave she saw the corn wave on the vale she saw the deer run down the dale she saw the plaid and the broad claymore and the brows that the badge of freedom bore and she thought she had seen the land before she saw a lady sit on a throne the fairest that ever the sun shone on a lion her hand of milk and she held him in a leish of silk and a maiden stood at her knee with a silver wand and melting her sovereign shield till love stole in and all the fount within then a gruff untoward bedesman came and hundit the lion on his dame and the guardian maid the dauntless she a tear and left her knee and she saw till the queen frae the lion fled till the bonniest flower of the world lay dead a coffin was set on a distant plain and she saw the red blood fall like rain then bonnie heart grew sair and she away and could look nae mair then the gruff grim carle amain and they trampled him down but he rose again and he baited the lion to deeds of weir till he the blood to the kingdom dear lone wistful snarled weir war and weening his head was danger preef when with the rose and clover leaf he at the carle and chased him to feed the deer on the mountain gray he at the carle and at heaven but his mark was set and his arles given kilmeny a while her withdrew she again and the scene was new she saw before her fair one half of all the glowing world where oceans and rivers ran to bound the aims of sinful man she saw a people fierce and fell burst frae their bounds like fiends of hell their lilies grew and the eagle flew and she herkèd on her ravening crew till the cities and towers were in a blaze and the thunder it the lands and the seas the widows they and the red blood ran and she threatened an end to the race of man she never lened nor stood in awe till caught by the deadly paw o then the eagle for life and up a mortal strife but flew she north or flew she south she met the gowl the mouth with a mooted wing and maen the eagle sought her eiry again but lang may she cower in her bloody nest and lang lang sleek her wounded breast howled mocked arles money paid on striking bargain fig a beating lened crouched laboured stirred beat mooted moulted before she sey another flight to play with the norland might but to sing the sights kilmeny saw so far surpassing law the voice wad sink away and the string of his harp wad cease to play but she saw till the sorrows of man were bye and all was love and harmony till the stars of heaven fell calmly away like flakes of snaw on a winter day then kilmeny again to the friends she had left in her own countrye to tell of the place where she had been and the glories that lay in the land unseen to warn the living maidens fair the loved of heaven the care that all whose minds unmeled shall bloom in beauty when time is gane with distant music soft and deep they kilmeny sound asleep and when she she lay her lane all with flowers in the green wood wene when seven lang years had come and fled when grief was calm and hope was dead when scarce was name late late in a

floats along the twilight sea but she loved to raike the lanely glen and keepèd afar frae the haunts of men her holy hymns unheard to sing to suck the flowers and drink the spring but wherever her peaceful form the wild beasts of the hill were the wolf blythly round the field the lordly byson and the dun deer with manner bland and aneath her lily hand and when at even the woodlands rung when hymns of other worlds she in ecstasy of sweet devotion o then the glen was all in motion the wild beasts of the forest came broke from their bughts and faulds the tame and goved around and amazed even

nearer view a spirit yet a woman too her household motions light and free and steps of virgin liberty a countenance in which did sweet records promises as sweet a creature not too bright or for human daily food for transient sorrows simple wiles praise blame love kisses tears and smiles and now i see with eye the very pulse of the machine a being breathing thoughtful breath a traveller between

danced but out did the sparkling waves in glee a poet could not but be gay in such a jocund company i gazed and gazed but little what wealth the show to me had brought for oft when on my couch i in

god o duty if that name thou love who art a light to guide a to check the erring and reprove thou who art victory and when empty terrors overawe from vain temptations dost set free and the weary strife of frail humanity there are who ask not if thine be on them who in love and truth where no misgiving is upon the genial sense of youth glad hearts without reproach or blot who do thy work and know it not o if through confidence they fail thy saving arms dread power around them cast serene will be our days and bright and happy will our nature be when love is an unerring light and joy its own security and they a blissful course may even now who not unwisely bold live in the spirit of this creed yet seek thy firm support according to their need i loving freedom and untried no sport of every random gust yet being to myself a guide too blindly have reposed my trust and oft when in my heart was thy timely mandate i the task in smoother walks to stray but thee i now would serve more strictly if i may through no disturbance of my soul or strong compunction in me wrought i supplicate for thy control but in the quietness of thought me this freedom tires i feel the weight of chance desires my hopes no more must change their name i long for a repose that ever is the same yet not the less would i still act according to the of my own wish and feel past that my submissiveness was choice not seeking in the school of for over dignified denial and restraint i no farther than they breed a second will more wise stern lawgiver yet thou dost the most benignant grace nor know we anything so as is the smile upon thy face flowers laugh before thee on their beds and fragrance in thy footing treads thou dost preserve the stars from wrong and the most ancient heavens through thee

glorious birth but yet i know i go that there hath away a glory from the earth now while the birds thus sing a joyous song and while the young lambs as to the sound to me alone there came a thought of grief a timely utterance gave that thought relief and i again am strong the cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep no more shall grief of mine the season wrong i hear the echoes through the mountains throng the winds come to me from the fields of sleep and all the earth is gay land and give themselves up to jollity and with the heart of doth every beast keep holiday thou child of joy

valleys far and wide fresh flowers while the sun shines warm and the babe leaps up on his arm i hear i hear with joy i hear but a tree of many one a single field which i have upon both of them speak of something that is gone the pansy at my doth the same tale repeat whither is fled the visionary gleam where is it now the glory and the dream our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting the soul that rises with us our star hath had elsewhere its setting and cometh from afar not in entire forgetfulness and not in utter nakedness but trailing clouds of glory do we from god who is our home heaven

travel still is priest and by the vision is on his way attended at length the man perceives it die away and fade into the light of common day earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own yearnings she hath in her own natural kind and even with something of a mind and no unworthy aim the homely nurse doth all she to make her foster child her inmate man forget the glories he hath known and that imperial palace whence he came behold the child among his new born blisses a six darling of a pigmy size see where work of his own hand he lies fretted by sallies of his kisses with light upon him from his eyes see at his feet some little plan or chart some fragment from his dream of human life shaped by himself with newly learnèd art a wedding or a festival a mourning or a funeral and this hath now his heart and unto this he frames his song then will he fit his to dialogues of business love or strife but it will not be ere this be thrown aside and with new joy and the little actor cons

thy immensity thou best philosopher who yet dost thy heritage thou eye among the blind that deaf and silent the eternal deep haunted for ever by the eternal mind mighty prophet seer blest on whom those truths do rest which we are toiling all our lives to find in darkness lost the darkness of the grave thou over whom thy broods like the day a master a slave a presence which is not to be put by to whom the is but a lonely bed without the sense or of day or the warm light a place of thought where we in waiting lie thou little child yet glorious in the of heaven born freedom on thy height why with such earnest pains dost thou the years to bring the inevitable yoke thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight and custom lie upon thee with a weight heavy as frost and deep almost as life o joy that in our is something that doth live that nature yet what was so fugitive the thought of our past years in me doth perpetual benediction not for that which is most worthy to be blest delight and liberty the simple of childhood whether busy or at rest with new fledged hope still fluttering in his breast not for these i the song of thanks and praise but for those obstinate of sense and outward things fallings from us vanishings blank misgivings of a moving about in worlds not realized high instincts before which our mortal did tremble like a guilty thing surprised but for those first affections those shadowy recollections which be they what they may are yet the fountain light of all our day are yet a master light of all our seeing uphold us cherish and have power to our noisy years seem moments in the of the eternal silence truths that wake to perish never which neither listlessness nor mad endeavour nor man nor boy nor all that is at enmity with joy can utterly abolish or destroy hence in a season of calm though inland far we be our souls have sight of that immortal which brought us hither can in a moment travel thither and see the children sport upon the shore and hear the mighty waters rolling evermore then sing ye birds sing sing a joyous song and let the young lambs as to the sound we in thought will join your throng ye that pipe and ye that play ye that through your hearts to feel the gladness of the may what though the radiance which was once so be now for ever taken from my sight though nothing can bring back the of splendour in the grass of glory in the flower we will grieve not rather strength in what remains behind in the primal which having been must ever be in the soothing thoughts that out of human suffering in the faith that looks through death in years that bring the philosophic mind and o ye fountains meadows hills and groves forebode not any severing of our loves yet in my heart of hearts i feel your might i only have relinquished one to live beneath your more habitual sway i love the brooks which down their channels fret even more than when i lightly as they the innocent

a and detaineth one it is an ancient mariner and he stoppeth one of three thy long grey beard and glittering eye now wherefore thou me the doors are wide and i am next of kin the guests are met the feast is set hear the merry din he holds him with his skinny hand was a ship quoth he off unhand me grey beard loon eftsoons his hand dropt he sidenote the wedding guest is spellbound by the eye of the man and constrained to hear his tale he holds him with his glittering eye the wedding guest stood still and listens like a three child the mariner hath his will the wedding guest sat on a stone he cannot choose but hear and thus spake on that ancient man the bright eyed mariner ship was the harbour merrily did we below the kirk below the hill below the lighthouse top sidenote the mariner tells how the ship sailed southward with a and fair weather till it reached the line the sun came up upon the left out of the sea came he and he shone bright and on the went down into the sea higher and higher every day till over the mast at noon the wedding guest here beat his breast for he heard the loud bassoon sidenote the wedding guest heareth the bridal music but the his tale the bride hath paced into the hall red as a rose is she nodding their heads before her the merry minstrelsy the wedding guest he beat his breast yet he cannot choose but hear and thus spake on that ancient man the bright eyed mariner sidenote the ship drawn by a storm toward the south pole now the storm blast came and was tyrannous and strong he struck with his wings and chased us south along with sloping masts and dipping prow as who pursued with yell and still treads the shadow of his foe and forward bends his head the ship drove fast loud the blast and southward aye we fled and now there came both mist and snow and it grew wondrous cold and ice mast high came floating by as green as emerald sidenote the land of ice and of fearful sounds where no living to be seen and through the drifts the snowy did send a dismal sheen nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken the ice was all between the ice was here the ice was there the ice was all around it and and and like noises in a swound sidenote till a great sea bird called the albatross came through fog and was received with great joy and hospitality at length did cross an albatross thorough the fog it came as if it had been a christian soul we it in name it ate the food it had eat and round and round it flew the ice did split with a thunder fit the helmsman us through sidenote and lo the albatross proveth a bird of good omen the ship as it returned northward through fog and and a good south wind sprung up behind the albatross did follow and every day for food or play came to the hollo in mist or cloud on mast or shroud it for vespers nine whiles all the night through fog smoke white the white moonshine sidenote the ancient mariner inhospitably killeth the pious bird omen save thee ancient mariner from the fiends that plague thee thus why thou so my i shot the albatross sun now rose upon the right out of the sea came he still hid in mist and on the went down into the sea and the good south wind still blew behind but no sweet bird did follow nor any day for food or came to the hollo sidenote his shipmates cry out against the ancient mariner for bird of good luck and i had done a hellish thing and it would work woe for all i had the that made the breeze to blow ah wretch said they the bird to slay that made the breeze to blow sidenote but when the fog cleared off they justify the same and themselves accomplices in the crime nor dim nor red like own head the glorious sun uprist then all i had the that brought the fog and mist right said they such birds to slay that bring the fog and mist sidenote the fair breeze continues the ship enters the pacific ocean sails northward even till it reaches the line the fair breeze blew the white foam flew the furrow free we were the first that ever into that silent sea sidenote the ship hath been suddenly becalmed down dropt the breeze the sails dropt down sad as sad could be and we did speak only to the silence of the sea all in a hot and copper sky the bloody sun at noon right up above the mast did stand no bigger than the moon day after day day after day we stuck nor breath nor motion as idle as a painted upon a painted ocean sidenote and the albatross begins to be avenged water water everywhere and all the boards did shrink water water everywhere nor any drop to drink the very deep did rot o christ that ever this should be yea slimy things did crawl with upon the slimy sea about about in reel and the death fires danced at night the water like a oils burnt green and blue and white sidenote a spirit had followed them one of the invisible this planet neither departed souls nor angels concerning whom jew josephus and the platonic constantinopolitan may be consulted they are very numerous and there is or element without one or more and some in dreams assurèd or the spirit that plagued us so nine fathom deep he had from the land of mist and snow and every tongue through utter drought was at the root we could not speak no more than we had been choked with soot sidenote the shipmates in their sore distress would fain throw guilt on the ancient mariner in sign whereof they hang the bird round his neck ah well a day what evil had i from old and young instead of the cross the about my neck was hung sidenote the ancient mariner beholdeth a sign in the element passed a weary time each was and glazed each eye a weary time a weary time how glazed each weary eye when looking westward i a something in the sky at first it a little speck and then it a mist it moved and moved and took at a certain shape i wist a speck a mist a shape i wist and still it and as if it dodged a water sprite it plunged and and sidenote at its nearer approach it seemeth him to be a ship and at ransom he freeth his speech from the bonds of thirst with throats unslaked with black lips baked we could nor laugh nor wail through utter drought all dumb we stood i bit my arm i the blood and cried a sail a sail sidenote a flash of joy with throats unslaked with black lips baked agape they heard me call gramercy they for joy did grin and all at once their breath drew in as they were drinking all sidenote and horror follows for can it be a ship that comes wind or tide see see i cried she tacks no more hither to work us weal without a breeze without a tide she steadies with upright keel the western wave was all aflame the day was wellnigh done almost upon the western rested the broad bright sun when that strange shape drove betwixt us and the sun sidenote it seemeth him but the skeleton of a ship and straight the sun was with mother send us grace as if through a dungeon grate he with broad and burning face alas thought i and my heart beat loud how fast she nears and nears are those her sails that glance in the sun like restless gossameres sidenote and its ribs are seen as bars on the face of the setting sun spectre woman and her death mate and no other on board ship like vessel like crew are those her ribs through which the did peer as through a grate and is that woman all her crew is that a death and are there two is death that mate her lips were red her looks were free her locks were yellow as gold her skin was as white as leprosy the nightmare life in death was she who thicks blood with cold sidenote death and life in death have diced for the crew the latter winneth the ancient mariner the naked hulk alongside came and the twain were casting dice game is done won won quoth she and whistles thrice sidenote no twilight within the courts of the sun the rim dips the stars rush out at one stride comes the dark with far heard whisper the sea off shot the spectre bark sidenote at the rising of the moon we and sideways up fear at my heart as at a cup my life blood to sip the stars were dim and thick the night the face by his lamp white from the sails the dew did drip till clomb above the eastern the hornèd moon with one bright within the nether tip sidenote one after another one after one by the star moon too quick for groan or sigh each his face with a ghastly pang and cursed me with his eye sidenote his shipmates drop down dead four times fifty living and i heard nor sigh nor groan with heavy thump a lifeless lump they down one by one sidenote but life in death begins her work on the ancient mariner the souls did from their bodies fly they fled to bliss or woe and every soul it me like the whizz of my crossbow sidenote the wedding guest feareth that a spirit is talking to him fear thee ancient mariner i fear thy skinny hand and thou art long and lank and brown as is the sea sand sidenote but the ancient mariner assureth him of his bodily life to relate his horrible penance i fear thee and thy glittering eye and thy skinny hand so brown not fear not thou wedding guest this body dropt not down alone alone all all alone alone on a wide wide sea and never a saint took pity my soul in agony sidenote he despiseth the creatures of the calm the many men so beautiful and they all dead did lie and a thousand thousand slimy lived on and so did i sidenote and envieth that they should live and so many lie dead i upon the rotting sea and drew my eyes away i upon the rotting deck and there the dead men lay i to heaven and tried to pray but or ever a prayer had gusht a wicked whisper came and my heart as dry as dust i closed my lids and kept them close and the balls like pulses beat but the sky and the sea and the sea and the sky lay like a load on my weary eye and the dead were at my feet sidenote but the curse liveth for him in the eye of the dead men the cold sweat melted from their limbs nor rot nor reek did they the look with which they on had never away an curse would drag to a spirit from on high but oh more horrible than is the curse in a dead eye seven days seven nights i saw that curse and yet i could not die sidenote in his loneliness and fixedness he yearneth towards the moon the stars that still sojourn yet still move onward and blue sky belongs to them and is their appointed rest and country and their own natural homes which they as lords that are certainly expected and yet there is joy at their arrival the moving moon went up the sky and nowhere did abide softly she was going up and a star or two beside her beams the sultry main like april hoar frost spread but where the huge shadow lay the charmèd water burnt a still and awful red sidenote by the light of the moon he beholdeth creatures of calm beyond the shadow of the ship i the water snakes they moved in tracks of shining white and when they the elfish fell off in hoary flakes within the shadow of the i their rich attire blue glossy green and velvet black they and swam and every was a flash of golden fire sidenote their beauty and their happiness sidenote he blesseth them in his heart o happy living things no their beauty might declare a spring of love from my heart and i them unaware sure my kind saint took pity on me and i them unaware sidenote the spell begins to break the selfsame moment i could pray and from my neck so the albatross fell off and like lead into the sea sleep it is a gentle thing beloved from pole to pole to mary queen the praise be given she sent the gentle sleep from heaven that slid into my soul sidenote by grace of the holy mother the ancient mariner is rain the silly buckets on the deck that had so long i dreamt that they were with dew and when i awoke it my lips were wet my throat was cold my garments all were dank sure i had drunken in my dreams and still my body drank i moved and could not feel my limbs i was so light i thought that i had died in sleep and was a blessèd ghost sidenote he heareth sounds and seeth strange sights and commotions sky and the element and soon i heard a roaring wind it did not come anear but with its sound it shook the sails that were so thin and sere the upper air burst into life and a hundred fire flags sheen to and fro they were hurried about and to and fro and in and out the wan stars danced between and the coming wind did roar more loud and the sails did sigh like sedge and the rain down from one black cloud the moon was at its edge the thick black cloud was cleft and the moon was at its side like waters shot from some high crag the lightning fell with never a jag a river steep and wide sidenote the bodies of the crew are inspired and the on the loud wind never reached the ship yet now the ship moved on beneath the lightning and the the dead men gave a groan they they they all uprose nor spake nor moved their eyes it had been strange even in a dream to have seen those dead men rise the helmsman the ship moved on yet never a breeze up blew the mariners all work the ropes where they were wont to do they raised their limbs like lifeless tools we were a ghastly crew the body of my stood by me knee to knee the body and i at one rope but he said naught to me sidenote but not by the souls of the men nor by demons of earth air but by a blessed troop of angelic spirits sent down by of the guardian saint fear thee ancient mariner calm thou wedding guest not those souls that fled in pain which to their corses came again but a troop of spirits blest for when it they their arms and round the mast sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths and from their bodies around around flew each sweet sound then darted to the sun slowly the sounds came back again now now one by one sometimes a dropping from the i heard the skylark sing sometimes all little birds that are how they to fill the sea and with their sweet jargoning and now like all instruments now like a lonely flute and now it is an song that makes the heavens be mute it ceased yet still the sails made a pleasant noise till noon a noise like of a hidden in the leafy month of june that to the sleeping woods all singeth a quiet tune till noon we quietly on yet never a breeze did breathe slowly and smoothly went the ship moved onward from beneath sidenote the lonesome spirit from the south pole carries on the far as the line in obedience to the angelic troop but vengeance under the keel nine fathom deep from the land of mist and snow the spirit slid and it was that made the ship to go the sails at noon left off their tune and the ship stood still also the sun right up above the mast had her to the ocean but in a minute she stir with a short uneasy motion backwards and forwards half her with a short uneasy motion then like a pawing horse let go she made a sudden bound it flung the blood into my head and i fell down in a swound sidenote the polar fellow demons the invisible the element take part in his wrong and two of them relate one other that penance long and heavy for the ancient mariner hath to the polar spirit who returneth southward how long in that same fit i lay i have not to declare but ere my living life i heard and in my soul two voices in the air it he quoth one this the man by him who died on cross with his cruel bow he laid full the harmless albatross the spirit who bideth by in the land of mist and snow he loved the bird that loved the who shot him with his bow the other was a softer voice as soft as honey dew quoth he man hath penance done and penance more will do first voice tell me tell me speak again thy soft response renewing what makes that ship drive on so fast what is the ocean doing second voice as a slave before his lord the ocean hath no blast his great bright eye most up to the moon is cast if he may know which way to go for she guides him smooth or grim see brother see how she looketh down on him sidenote the mariner hath been cast into a trance for the causeth the vessel to drive northward faster than human life first voice why drives on that ship so fast without or wave or wind second voice air is cut away before and closes from behind fly brother fly more high more high or we shall be belated for slow and slow that ship will go when the trance is abated sidenote the super natural motion is retarded the mariner awakes penance begins anew i woke and we were sailing as in a gentle weather night calm night the moon was high the dead men stood together all stood together on the deck for a charnel dungeon fitter all on me their stony eyes that in the moon did glitter the pang the curse with which they died had never away i could not draw my eyes from theirs nor turn them up to pray sidenote the curse is finally expiated and now this spell was snapt once i viewed the ocean green and far forth yet little of what had else been seen like one that on a lonesome doth walk in fear and dread and having once turned round walks on and turns no more his head because he knows a frightful doth close behind him tread but soon there breathed a wind on me nor sound nor motion made its path was not upon the sea in ripple or in shade it raised my hair it my like a meadow gale of spring it mingled strangely with my fears yet it felt like a welcoming swiftly swiftly flew the ship yet she softly too sweetly sweetly blew the breeze on me alone it blew sidenote and the ancient mariner beholdeth his native country o dream of joy is this the lighthouse top i see is this the hill is this the kirk is this mine own countree we drifted the harbour bar and i with sobs did pray o let me be awake my god or let me sleep alway the harbour bay was clear as glass so smoothly it was strewn and on the bay the moonlight lay and the shadow of the moon the rock shone bright the kirk no that stands above the rock the moonlight in the steady weathercock sidenote the angelic spirits leave the dead bodies and the bay was white with silent till rising from the same full many shapes that shadows were in crimson colours came sidenote and appear in their own forms of light a little distance from the those crimson shadows were i my eyes upon the deck o christ what saw i there each corse lay flat lifeless and flat and by the holy rood a man all light a seraph man on every corse there stood this seraph band each waved his hand it was a heavenly sight they stood as signals to the land each one a lovely light this seraph band each waved his hand no voice did they impart no voice but o the silence like music on my heart but soon i heard the dash of oars i heard the cheer my head was perforce away and i saw a boat appear the pilot and the boy i heard them coming fast dear lord in heaven it was a the dead men could not blast i saw a third i heard his voice it is the hermit good he singeth loud his godly that he makes in the wood shrieve my soul wash the blood sidenote the hermit of the wood hermit good lives in that which slopes down to the sea how loudly his sweet voice he rears he loves to talk with that come from a far countree he kneels at morn and noon and eve he hath a cushion plump it is the moss that wholly the rotted old oak stump the skiff boat i heard them talk this is strange i trow where are those lights so many and fair that signal made but now sidenote approacheth the ship with wonder by my faith the hermit said they not our cheer the planks look and see those sails how thin they are and sere i never saw aught like to them unless perchance it brown skeletons of leaves that my forest brook along when the ivy tod is heavy with snow and the owlet whoops to the wolf below that eats the she young lord it hath a fiendish look the pilot made reply i am a on push on said the hermit cheerily the boat came closer to the ship but i nor spake nor the boat came close beneath the ship and straight a sound was heard sidenote the ship suddenly sinketh under the water it rumbled on still louder and more dread it the ship it split the bay the ship went down like lead sidenote the ancient mariner is saved in the boat by that loud and dreadful sound which sky and ocean smote like one that hath been seven days my body lay afloat but swift as dreams myself i within the boat upon the whirl where sank the ship the boat spun round and round and all was still save that the was telling of the sound i moved my lips the pilot and fell down in a fit the holy hermit raised his eyes and where he did sit i took the oars the boy who now doth crazy go loud and long and all the his eyes went to and fro ha quoth he plain i the devil knows how to row and now all in my own countree i stood on the firm land the hermit forth from the boat and scarcely he could stand sidenote the ancient mariner earnestly entreateth the hermit him and the penance of life falls on him shrieve me shrieve me holy man the hermit his brow quick quoth he bid thee say what manner of man art thou forthwith this frame of mine was with a woful agony which forced me to begin my tale and then it left me free sidenote and ever and anon throughout his future life an him to travel from land to land since then at an uncertain hour that agony returns and till my ghastly tale is told this heart within me burns i pass like night from land to land i have strange power of speech that moment that his face i see i know the man that must hear me to him my tale i teach what loud uproar bursts from that door the wedding guests are there but in the garden bower the and bride maids singing are and hark the little vesper bell which biddeth me to prayer o wedding guest this soul hath alone on a wide wide sea so lonely that god scarce seemèd there to be o sweeter than the marriage feast sweeter far to me to walk together to the with a goodly company to walk together to the kirk and all together pray while each to his great father bends old men and babes and loving friends and youths and maidens gay sidenote and to teach by his own example love and reverence to that god made and loveth farewell farewell but this i to thee thou wedding guest he prayeth well who loveth both man and bird and beast he prayeth best who loveth all things both great and small for the dear god who loveth us he made and loveth all the mariner whose eye is bright whose beard with age is hoar is gone and now the wedding from the door he went like one that hath been and is of sense forlorn a sadder and a wiser he rose the morrow morn 550 kubla khan in xanadu did kubla a stately pleasure dome decree where alph the sacred river through caverns measureless to down to a sunless sea so twice five miles of fertile with walls and towers were girdled round and there were gardens bright with sinuous where many an incense bearing tree and here were forests ancient as the hills enfolding sunny spots of greenery but o that deep romantic chasm which down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover a savage place as holy and as beneath a waning moon was by woman wailing for her demon lover and from this chasm with ceaseless turmoil seething as if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing a mighty fountain momently was forced amid whose swift half intermitted huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail or chaffy grain beneath the flail and these dancing rocks at once and it flung up momently the sacred river five miles meandering with a mazy through wood and dale the sacred river ran then the caverns measureless to man and sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean and this tumult kubla heard from ancestral voices prophesying war the shadow of the dome of floated midway on the waves where was heard the mingled from the fountain and the caves it was a miracle of rare device a sunny pleasure dome with caves of ice a damsel with a in a vision once i saw it was an abyssinian maid and on her dulcimer she singing of mount abora could i revive within me her symphony and song to such a deep delight win me that with music loud and long i would build that dome in air that sunny dome those caves of ice and all who heard should see them there and all should cry beware beware his flashing eyes his floating hair weave a circle round him thrice and close your eyes with holy dread for he on honey dew hath fed and drunk the milk of paradise 551 love all thoughts all passions all delights whatever stirs this mortal frame all are but ministers of love and feed his sacred flame oft in my waking dreams do live again that happy hour when midway on the mount i lay beside the tower the moonshine stealing the scene had blended with the lights of eve and she was there my hope my joy my own dear genevieve she against the armèd man the statue of the armèd knight she stood and to my lay amid the lingering light few sorrows hath she of her own my hope my joy my genevieve she loves me best i the songs that make her grieve i a soft and doleful air i sang an old and moving story an old rude song that suited that ruin wild and hoary she with a flitting blush with downcast eyes and modest grace for well she knew i could not but gaze upon her face i told her of the knight that upon his shield a burning brand and that for ten long years he the lady of the land i told her how he pined and ah the deep the low the pleading with which i sang love interpreted my own she listened with a flitting blush with downcast eyes and modest grace and she forgave me that i too fondly on her face but when i told the cruel that crazed that bold and lovely knight and that he the mountain woods nor rested day nor night that sometimes from the savage den and sometimes from the darksome shade and sometimes starting up at in green and sunny glade there came and him in the an angel beautiful and bright and that he knew it was a fiend this miserable knight and that unknowing what he did he amid a murderous band and saved from outrage worse than the lady of the land and how she wept and his knees and how she tended him in vain and ever strove to the scorn that crazed his brain and that she nursed him in a cave and how his madness went away when on the yellow forest a dying man he lay his dying words but when i that tenderest strain of all the ditty my faltering voice and pausing her soul with pity all impulses of soul and had my guileless genevieve the music and the doleful tale the rich and balmy eve and hopes and fears that kindle hope an undistinguishable throng and gentle wishes long subdued subdued and long she wept with pity and delight she with love and virgin shame and like the murmur of a dream i heard her breathe my name her bosom heaved she aside as conscious of my look she stept then suddenly with timorous she fled to me and wept she half enclosed me with her arms she me with a meek embrace and bending back her head up and gazed upon my face partly love and partly fear and partly a bashful art that i might rather feel than see the swelling of her heart i her fears and she was calm and told her love with virgin pride and so i won my genevieve my bright and beauteous bride 552 youth and age verse a breeze blossoms straying where hope clung feeding like a bee both were mine life went a with nature hope and poesy when i was young when i was young ah woful when ah for the change now and then this breathing house not built with hands this body that does me grievous wrong aery cliffs and glittering sands how lightly then it along like those trim skiffs unknown of yore on winding lakes and rivers wide that ask no aid of sail or oar that fear no spite of wind or tide naught cared this body for wind or when youth and i lived in together flowers are lovely love is flower like friendship is a sheltering tree o the joys that came down shower like of friendship love and liberty ere i was old ere i was old ah woful ere which tells me no longer here o youth for years so many and sweet known that thou and i were one think it but a fond conceit it cannot be that thou art gone thy vesper bell hath not yet and thou wert aye a masker bold what strange disguise hast now put on to make believe that thou art gone i see these locks in silvery slips this drooping gait this size but springtide blossoms on thy lips and tears take sunshine from thine eyes life is but thought so think i that youth and i are housemates still dewdrops are the gems of morning but the tears of mournful eve where no hope is a that only serves to make us grieve when we are old that only serves to make us with oft and tedious taking leave like some poor nigh related that may not rudely be dismist yet hath his welcome while and tells the jest without the smile 553 time real and imaginary on the wide level of a i knew not where but some faery place their pinions ostrich like for sails outspread two lovely children run an endless race a sister and a brother this far the other yet ever runs she with reverted face and looks and listens for the boy behind for he alas is blind rough and smooth with even step he and knows not whether he be first or last 554 work without hope all nature seems at work slugs leave their lair the bees are stirring birds are on the wing and winter slumbering in the open air wears on his smiling face a dream of spring and i the while the sole unbusy thing nor honey make nor pair nor build nor sing yet well i ken the banks where amaranths blow have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow bloom o ye amaranths bloom for whom ye may for me ye bloom not glide rich streams away with lips wreathless brow i stroll and would you learn the spells that drowse my soul work without hope draws nectar in a sieve and hope without an object cannot live 555 song a sunny shaft did i behold from sky to earth it slanted and poised therein a bird so bold sweet bird thou wert enchanted he sank he rose he twinkled he within that shaft of sunny mist his eyes of fire his beak of gold all else of amethyst and thus he sang adieu dreams prove seldom true the blossoms they make no delay the sparking dew drops will not stay sweet month of may we must away far far away to day to day 556 his books my days among the dead are past around me i behold these casual eyes are cast the mighty minds of old my never failing friends are they with whom i converse day by day with them i take delight in and seek relief in woe and while i understand and how much to them i owe my cheeks have often been with tears of thoughtful gratitude my thoughts are with the dead with i live in long past years their virtues love their faults condemn partake their hopes and fears and from their lessons seek and instruction with an humble mind my hopes are with the dead my place with them will be and i with them shall travel through all futurity yet leaving here a name i trust that will not perish in the dust savage 557 the lament i loved him not and yet now he is gone i feel i am alone i him while he spoke yet could he speak alas i would not check for reasons not to love him once i sought and wearied all my to vex myself and him i now would my love could he but who lately lived for me and when he vain in holy he hid his face amid the shades of death i waste for him my who wasted his for me but mine returns and this lorn bosom with stifling heat heaving it up in sleep and waking me to tears that had melted his soft heart for wept he as bitter tears god such was his latest prayer may she never share quieter is his breath his breast more than daisies in the mould where children spell athwart the churchyard gate his name and brief date pray for him gentle souls you be and o pray too for me

memories and i consecrate to thee 559 ianthe from you ianthe little troubles like little ripples down a sunny river your pleasures spring like daisies in the grass cut down and up again as blithe as

grass i see them and i ask not they glimmer or they pass with folded arms i linger to call them back vain in this or in some other spot i know shine again 564 mother i cannot mind my wheel mother i cannot mind my wheel my fingers ache my lips are dry o if you felt the pain i feel but o who ever felt as i no longer could i doubt him true all other men may use deceit he always said my eyes were blue and often swore my lips were sweet 565 autumn mild is the parting year and the odour of the falling spray life passes on more rudely fleet and balmless is its closing day i wait its close i court its gloom but mourn that never must there or on my breast or on my the tear that would have soothed it all 566 remain remain ah not in youth alone youth where you are long will stay but when my summer days are gone and my autumnal haste away can i be always by your side no but the hours you can you must nor rise at approaching stride nor go when dust is gone to dust 567 absence here ever since you

thine alas were slaves yet cold in the earth at thy feet i would rather than wed what i loved not or turn one thought from thee they slander thee sorely who say thy vows are frail hadst thou been a false one thy cheek had less pale they say too so long thou hast worn those lingering chains that deep in thy heart they have printed their servile stains o foul is the slander no chain could that soul subdue where shineth thy spirit there liberty shineth too 584 the light of other days oft in the stilly night ere chain has bound me fond memory brings the of other days around me the smiles the

sky then i sing the wild song it once was rapture to hear when our voices commingling breathed like one on the ear and as echo far off through the vale my sad orison rolls i think o my love thy voice

snow at my head and cold at my feet and the finger of at my closing them to sleep let none tell my or my mother so dear meet them both in at the spring of the year 592 jenny me jenny me when we met jumping from the chair she sat in time you thief who love to sweets into your list put that in say weary say sad say that health and wealth have me say growing old but add jenny me love 593 love and age i with you cowslips blowing when i was six and you were four when garlands weaving flower balls throwing were pleasures soon to please no more through groves and meads grass and heather with little playmates to and fro we hand in hand together but that was sixty years ago you grew a lovely roseate maiden and still our early love was strong still with no care our days were laden they glided joyously along and i did love you very dearly how dearly words want power to show i thought your heart was as nearly but that was fifty years ago then other lovers came around you your beauty grew from year to year and many a splendid circle found the centre of its glittering sphere i saw you then first vows forsaking on rank and wealth your hand bestow o then i thought my heart was breaking but that was forty years ago and i lived on to wed another no cause she gave me to repine and when i heard you were a mother i did not wish the children mine my own young flock in fair progression made up a pleasant christmas row my joy in them was past expression but that was thirty years ago you grew a matron plump and comely you dwelt in brightest blaze my earthly lot was far more homely but i too had my festal days no merrier eyes have ever around the hearth wintry glow than when my youngest child was but that was twenty years ago time my eldest girl was married and i am now a grandsire gray one pet of four years old among the wild meads to play in our old fields of childish pleasure where now as then the cowslips blow she fills her ample measure and that is not ten years ago but though first has away in colder light i still have thought of you with kindness and shall do till our last good night the ever rolling silent will bring a time we shall not know when our young days of gathering will be an hundred years ago 594 the grave of love i dug beneath the cypress shade what well might seem an grave and every pledge in earth i laid that erst thy false affection gave i them down the sod beneath i placed one mossy stone above and twined the fading around the sepulchre of love frail as thy love the flowers were ere yet the evening sun was set but years shall see the cypress spread immutable as my regret 595 three men of gotham seamen three what men be ye three wise men we be whither in your bowl so free to rake the moon from out the sea the bowl goes trim the moon doth shine and our ballast is old wine and your ballast is old wine who art thou so fast adrift i am he they call old care here on board we will thee lift no i may not enter there wherefore so decree in a bowl care may not be in a bowl care may not be fear ye not the waves that roll no in charmèd bowl we swim what the charm that floats the bowl water may not pass the brim the bowl goes trim the moon doth shine and our ballast is old wine and your ballast is old wine 596 to death come not in terrors clad to an unresisting prey come like an evening shadow death so stealthily so silently and shut mine eyes and steal my breath then willingly o willingly with thee go away what need to clutch with iron what gentlest touch may take what need with aspect dark to scare so awfully so terribly the weary soul would hardly care quietly tenderly from thy dread power to break not as when thou markest the young the blest the gay the loved the loving they who so happily so hopefully then harsh thy kindest call may seem and shrinkingly reluctantly the may obey but i have drunk enough of life the cup to with a little sweet at best so scantily so scantily to know full well that all the more bitterly more bitterly to the last will be and i may live to pain some that kindly cares for me to pain but not to bless o death come quietly come lovingly and shut mine eyes and steal my breath then willingly o willingly go away with thee gordon byron lord 597 when we two parted when we two in silence and tears half broken to sever for years pale grew thy cheek and cold colder thy kiss truly that hour sorrow to this the dew of the sunk chill on my brow it felt like the of what i feel now thy vows are all broken and light is thy fame i hear thy name spoken and share in its shame they name thee before me a knell to mine ear a shudder comes me why wert thou so dear they know not i knew thee who knew thee too well long long shall i rue thee too deeply to tell in secret we met in silence i grieve that thy heart could forget thy spirit deceive if i should meet after long years how should i greet thee with silence and tears 598 for music there be none of with a magic like thee and like music on the is thy sweet voice to me when as if its sound were the charmèd pausing the waves lie still and gleaming and the winds seem dreaming and the midnight moon is her bright chain the deep whose breast is gently heaving as an asleep so the spirit bows before thee to listen and adore thee with a full but soft emotion like the swell of ocean 599 go no more a roving so go no more a so late into the night though the heart be still as loving and the moon be still as bright for the sword outwears its sheath and the soul wears out the breast and the heart must pause to breathe and love itself have rest though the night was made for loving and the day returns too soon yet go no more a by the light of the moon 600 she walks in beauty she walks in beauty like the of cloudless climes and starry skies and all best of dark and meet in her aspect and her eyes thus to that tender which heaven to gaudy day denies one shade the more one ray the less had half the nameless which waves in every raven tress or softly lightens her face where thoughts serenely sweet how pure how dear their dwelling place and on that cheek and that brow so soft so calm yet eloquent the smiles that win the tints that glow but tell of days in goodness spent a mind at peace with all below a heart whose love is innocent 601 the isles of greece the isles of greece the isles of where burning sappho loved and sung where grew the arts of war and peace where delos rose and phœbus sprung eternal summer gilds them yet but all except their sun is set the scian and the teian muse the harp the lute have found the

funeral note as his corse to the rampart we hurried not a soldier discharged his farewell the grave where our hero we buried we buried him darkly at dead of night the sods with our bayonets turning by the struggling misty and the lanthorn dimly burning no useless coffin enclosed his breast not in sheet or in shroud we wound him but he lay like a warrior taking his with his martial cloak around him few and short were the prayers we said and we spoke not a word of sorrow but we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead and we bitterly thought of the morrow we thought as we his narrow and smoothed down his lonely pillow that the foe and the stranger would tread his head and we far away on the billow lightly talk of the spirit gone and his cold ashes upbraid him but little reck if they let him sleep in the grave where a briton has laid him but half of our heavy task was when the clock struck the hour for retiring and we heard the distant and random that the foe was sullenly firing slowly and sadly we laid him down from the field of his fame fresh and gory we carved not a line and we raised not a stone but we left him alone with his glory 604 to mary if i had thought thou couldst have died i might not weep for thee but i forgot when by thy side that thou couldst mortal be it never through my mind had the time would be and i on thee should look my last and thou shouldst smile no more and still upon that face i look and think smile again and still the thought i will not brook that i must look in vain but when i speak thou dost not what thou unsaid and now i feel as well i may sweet mary thou art dead if thou wouldst stay as thou art all cold and all serene i still might press thy silent heart and where thy smiles have been while thy chill bleak corse i have thou seemest still mine own but there i lay thee in thy grave and i am now alone i do not think thou art thou hast forgotten me and i perhaps may soothe this in thinking too of thee yet there was round thee such a of light seen before as fancy never could have drawn and never can restore bysshe 605 hymn of pan from the forests and we come we come from the river girt islands where loud waves are dumb listening to my sweet pipings the wind in the reeds and the rushes the bees on the bells of thyme the birds on the myrtle bushes the cicale above in the lime and the lizards below in the grass were as silent as ever old tmolus was listening to my sweet pipings liquid peneus was flowing and all dark tempe in shadow the light of the dying day speeded by my sweet pipings the sileni and sylvans and fauns and the nymphs of the woods and waves to the edge of the moist river lawns and the brink of the dewy caves and all that did then attend and follow were silent with love as you now apollo with envy of my sweet pipings i sang of the dancing stars i sang of the dædal earth and of heaven and the giant wars and love and death and birth and then i changed my pipings singing how down the vale of i pursued a maiden and a reed gods and men we are all deluded thus it breaks in our bosom and then we bleed all wept as i think both ye now would if envy or age had not frozen your blood at the sorrow of my sweet pipings 606 the invitation best and brightest come away fairer far than this fair day which like thee to those in sorrow comes to bid a sweet good to the rough year just in its cradle on the brake the brightest hour of unborn spring through the winter wandering found it seems the halcyon to hoar february born bending from heaven in azure mirth it the forehead of the earth and smiled upon the silent sea and bade the frozen streams be free and waked to music all their fountains and breathed upon the frozen mountains and like a prophetess of flowers upon the barren way making the wintry world like one on whom thou smilest dear away away from men and towns to the wild wood and the downs to the silent where the soul need not its music lest it should not an echo in mind while the touch of harmonizes heart to heart i leave this notice on my for each accustomed visitor am gone into the to take what this sweet hour yields reflection you may come to morrow sit by the fireside with sorrow you with the unpaid bill despair you tiresome verse reciter care i will pay you in the grave death will listen to your stave expectation too be off to day is for itself enough hope in pity mock not with smiles nor follow where i go long having lived on your sweet food at length i find one after long pain with all your love this you never told me of radiant sister of the day awake arise and come away to the wild woods and the plains and the pools where winter image all their roof of leaves where the pine its garland of sapless green and ivy round stems that never kiss the sun where the lawns and pastures be and the sandhills of the sea when the melting hoar frost the daisy star that never sets and wind flowers and which yet join not scent to hue crown the pale year weak and new when the night is left in the deep east dun and blind and the blue noon is over us and the billows murmur at our where the earth and ocean meet and all things seem only in the universal sun 607 hellas the great age begins anew the golden years return the earth doth like a snake her winter weeds outworn heaven smiles and faiths and empires like wrecks of a dissolving dream a brighter hellas rears its from waves serener far a new peneus rolls his against the morning star where fairer tempes bloom there young cyclads on a sunnier deep a loftier argo cleaves the main fraught with a later prize another orpheus sings again and loves and weeps and dies a new ulysses leaves once calypso for his native shore o write no more the tale of troy if earth scroll must be nor mix with laian rage the which dawns upon the free although a subtler sphinx riddles of death thebes never knew another athens shall arise and to remoter bequeath like sunset to the skies the splendour of its prime and leave if naught so bright may live all earth can take or heaven can give saturn and love their long shall burst more bright and than all who fell than one who rose than many unsubdued not gold not blood their altar dowers but votive tears and symbol flowers o cease must hate and death return cease must men kill and die cease drain not to its dregs the of bitter prophecy the world is weary of the past o might it die or rest at last 608 to a skylark hail to thee blithe spirit bird thou never wert that from heaven or near pourest thy full in profuse strains of unpremeditated art higher still and from the earth thou springest like a cloud of fire the blue deep thou wingest and singing still dost soar and soaring ever singest in the golden of the sunken sun which clouds are thou dost float and run like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun the pale purple melts around thy flight like a star of heaven in the broad thou art unseen but yet i hear thy shrill delight keen as are the of that silver whose intense lamp in the white dawn clear until we hardly see we feel that it is there all the earth and with thy voice is loud as when night is bare from one lonely the moon rains out her beams and heaven is what thou art we know not what is most like thee from rainbow clouds there flow drops so bright to see as from thy presence showers a rain of melody like a poet in the light of thought singing hymns unbidden till the world is to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not like a high born in a palace tower soothing her love soul in secret with music sweet as love which overflows her bower like a glow worm in a dell of dew scattering its aërial among the flowers and grass which screen it from the view like a rose in its own green leaves by warm winds till the scent it makes faint with too much sweet these heavy wingèd sound of vernal on the twinkling grass rain flowers all that ever joyous and clear and fresh thy music doth surpass teach us sprite or bird what sweet thoughts are thine i have never praise of love or that panted forth a flood of rapture so divine chorus hymeneal or triumphal chant with thine would be but an empty vaunt a thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want what objects are the of thy happy strain what fields or waves or mountains what shapes of sky or plain what love of thine own kind what ignorance of pain with thy clear keen languor cannot be shadow of never came near thee thou lovest but knew sad satiety waking or asleep thou of death must things more true and than we mortals dream or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream we look before and after and pine for what is not our sincerest with some pain is fraught our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought yet if we could hate and pride and fear if we were things not to shed a tear i know not how thy joy we ever should come near better than all of delightful sound better than all that in books are found thy skill to poet were thou scorner of the ground teach me half the that thy brain must know such harmonious from my lips would flow the world should listen then as i am listening now 609 the moon and like a dying lady lean and pale who totters forth in a gauzy veil out of her chamber led by the and feeble wanderings of her fading brain the moon arose up in the murky a white and shapeless mass art thou pale for of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth wandering among the stars that have a different birth and ever changing like a joyless that finds no object worth its constancy 610 ode to the west wind o wild west wind thou breath of thou from whose unseen presence the leaves are driven like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing yellow and black and pale and hectic red pestilence stricken multitudes o who chariotest to their dark wintry the wingèd seeds where they lie cold and low each like a corpse within its grave thine azure sister of the spring shall her clarion the dreaming earth and driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air with living hues and odours plain and hill wild spirit which art moving everywhere destroyer and preserver hear o hear thou on whose stream the steep commotion loose clouds like decaying leaves are shed shook from the boughs of heaven and ocean angels of rain and lightning there are on the blue surface of thine airy surge like the bright hair uplifted from the of some fierce mænad even from the dim of the horizon to the height the locks of the approaching storm thou of the dying year to which this closing will be the dome of a vast sepulchre vaulted with all thy congregated of vapours from whose solid black rain and fire and hail will burst o hear thou who didst waken from his summer the blue mediterranean where he lay by the coil of his crystàlline streams beside a pumice isle in bay and saw in sleep old palaces and quivering within the intenser day all overgrown with azure moss and so sweet the sense faints picturing them for whose path the level cleave themselves into chasms while far the sea blooms and the oozy woods which the sapless foliage of the ocean thy voice and suddenly grow gray with fear and tremble and despoil themselves o hear if i were a dead leaf thou mightest bear if i were a swift cloud to fly with thee a wave to pant beneath thy power and the impulse of thy strength only less than thou o uncontrollable if i were as in my boyhood and could the comrade of thy wanderings over heaven as then when to outstrip thy skiey scarce a vision i would have as thus with thee in prayer in my sore need o lift me as a wave a leaf a cloud i fall upon the thorns of life i bleed a heavy weight of hours has chained and one too like thee tameless and swift and proud make me thy lyre even as the forest is what if my leaves are falling like its own the tumult of thy mighty will take from both a deep autumnal tone sweet though in sadness be thou spirit fierce my spirit be thou me impetuous one drive my dead thoughts over the universe like leaves to quicken a new birth and by the incantation of this verse scatter as from an ashes and sparks my words among mankind be through my lips to the trumpet of a prophecy o wind if winter comes can spring be far behind 611 the indian serenade i arise from dreams of in the first sweet sleep of night when the winds are breathing low and the stars are shining bright i arise from dreams of thee and a spirit in my hath led me who knows how to thy chamber window sweet the wandering airs they on the dark the silent stream and the odours pine like sweet thoughts in a dream the complaint it dies upon her heart as i must on thine o belovèd as thou art o lift me from the grass i die i faint i fail let thy love in kisses on my lips and eyelids pale my cheek is cold and white alas my heart beats loud and fast o press it to thine own again where it will break at last 612 night swiftly walk over the western wave spirit of night out of the misty eastern cave where all the long and lone daylight thou wovest dreams of joy and which make thee terrible and dear swift be thy flight wrap thy form in a mantle grey star inwrought blind with thine hair the eyes of day kiss her until she be wearied out then wander city and sea and land touching all with thine opiate wand come long sought when i arose and saw the dawn i for thee when light rode high and the dew was gone and noon lay heavy on flower and tree and the weary day to her rest lingering like an unloved guest i for thee thy brother death came and cried thou me thy sweet child sleep the filmy eyed like a noontide bee i nestle near thy side wouldst thou me and i replied not thee death will come when thou art dead soon too soon sleep will come when thou art fled of neither would i ask the i ask of thee belovèd night swift be thine approaching flight come soon soon 613 from the arabic my faint spirit was sitting in the of thy looks my love it panted for thee like the hind at for the brooks my love thy barb whose hoofs outspeed the flight bore thee far from me my heart for my weak feet were weary soon did companion thee ah fleeter far than fleetest storm or steed or the death they bear the heart which tender thought clothes like a with the wings of care in the battle in the darkness in the need shall mine cling to thee nor claim one smile for all the comfort love it may bring to thee 614 lines when the lamp is the light in the dust lies dead when the cloud is the glory is shed when the lute is broken sweet tones are when the lips have spoken loved accents are soon forgot as music and survive not the lamp and the lute the echoes no song when the spirit is mute no song but sad dirges like the wind through a cell or the mournful that ring the dead knell when hearts have once mingled love first leaves the well built nest the weak one is to endure what it once possest o love who the frailty of all things here why choose you the for your cradle your home and your bier its passions will rock thee as the storms rock the ravens on high bright reason will mock thee like the sun from a wintry sky from thy nest every will rot and thine eagle leave thee naked to laughter when leaves fall and cold winds come 615 to one word is too often for me to profane it one feeling too falsely for thee to disdain it one hope is too like for prudence to smother and pity from thee more than that from another i can give not what men call love but wilt thou accept the worship the heart lifts and the heavens reject not the desire of the moth for the star of the night for the morrow the devotion to something from the sphere of our sorrow 616 the question i that as i by the way bare winter suddenly was changed to spring and gentle odours led my steps astray with a sound of waters along a shelving bank of turf which under a copse and hardly dared to its green arms round the bosom of the stream but it and then fled as thou mightest in dream there grew pied wind flowers and violets daisies those arcturi of the earth the constellated flower that never sets faint oxlips tender bluebells at whose the sod scarce heaved and that tall flower that wets like a child half in tenderness and mirth its face with heaven collected when the low wind its voice it hears and in the warm hedge grew lush eglantine green cowbind and the moonlight may and cherry blossoms and white cups whose was the bright dew yet not by the day and wild roses and ivy serpentine with its dark buds and leaves wandering astray and flowers azure black and with gold fairer than any eyes behold and nearer to the trembling there grew broad flag flowers purple with white and starry river buds among the sedge and floating water lilies broad and bright which lit the oak that overhung the with moonlight beams of their own watery light and bulrushes and reeds of such deep as soothed the dazzled eye with sober sheen methought that of these visionary i made a nosegay bound in such a that the same hues which in their natural were mingled or opposed the like kept these children of the within my hand and then elate and gay i to the spot whence i had come that i might there present it o to whom 617 remorse away the moor is dark beneath the moon rapid clouds have drunk the last pale beam of even away the gathering winds will call the darkness soon and profoundest midnight shroud the serene lights of heaven pause not the time is past every voice cries tempt not with one last tear thy ungentle mood thy eye so glazed and cold dares not entreat thy stay duty and dereliction guide thee back to solitude away away to thy sad and silent home pour bitter tears on its desolated hearth watch the dim shades as like ghosts they go and come and complicate strange webs of melancholy mirth the leaves of wasted autumn woods shall float around thine head the blooms of dewy spring shall gleam beneath thy feet but thy soul or this world must fade in the frost that binds the dead ere frown and smile ere thou and peace may meet the cloud shadows of midnight possess their own repose for the weary winds are silent or the moon is in the deep some respite to its turbulence unresting ocean knows whatever moves or toils or grieves hath its appointed sleep thou in the grave shalt rest yet till the phantoms flee which that house and heath and garden made dear to thee erewhile thy remembrance and repentance and deep musings are not from the music of two voices and the light of one sweet smile 618 music when soft voices die music when soft voices die vibrates in the memory odours when sweet violets sicken live within the sense they quicken rose leaves when the rose is dead are for the bed and so thy thoughts when thou art gone love itself shall slumber on 619 willie and helen ye talk love unless it be to pain us wharefore ye talk whan ye say the sea maun twain us no because my love is light nor for your angry deddy to buy ye pearlins bright to busk ye like a leddy willy i can caird spin se can want for gin i hae my heart i hae the pearls it be time to praise this whan years tears has it will it be time to talk whan cauld care has it laid ae about her waist the held to heaven his luik was like the luik heart in twa is riven 619 clothing 620 burial of the dead i thought to meet no more so dreary interposing veil and thou so pure thy place in beyond where i could soar friend of this worthless heart but happier spring like unbidden violets from the sod where patiently thou thy sweet and sure repose the shadows fall more soothing the soft is full of cheering whispers like thine own while memory by thy grave lives thy funeral day the deep knell dying down the pause waiting their welcome at the gate sure with the words of thy spirit met us there and sought with us along the porch and entering in the pageant of sad so dear to faith and hope o hadst thou brought a strain from to cheer us happy soul thou hadst not the sacred springs of more tenderly and true than those deep warbled anthems high and low low as the grave high as eternal throne guiding through light and our mourning fancies wild till gently like soft golden clouds at around the western twilight all into a placid faith that even with beaming counts thy sad honours coffin bier and pall so many relics of a frail love lost so many tokens of endless love begun listen it is no dream gives earnest of calmly now our hearts yet beating to that victorious most like a to the martial of a true comrade in the grave we our treasure for awhile and if a tear steal down if human anguish the shaded pass shuddering when the handful of pure touches the coffin lid if at our name once and again the thought ever gone come us like a cloud yet gentle spright thou turnest not away thou us calm at heart one look and we have seen our last of thee till we too sleep and our long sleep be o cleanse us ere we that countenance pure again thou who canst change the heart and raise the dead as thou art by to soothe our parting hour be ready when we meet with thy dear pardoning words 621 written in northampton county asylum i am yet what i am who cares or knows my friends forsake me like a memory lost i am the self consumer of my woes they rise and vanish an oblivious host shadows of life whose very soul is lost and yet i am i live though i am into the nothingness of scorn and noise into the living sea of waking dream where there is neither sense of life nor joys but the huge shipwreck of my own and all dear even those i loved the are strange nay they are stranger than the rest i long for scenes where man has never trod for scenes where woman never smiled or wept there to abide with my creator god and sleep as i in childhood sweetly slept full of high thoughts unborn so let me lie the grass below above the vaulted sky dorothea 622 dirge calm on the bosom of thy god fair spirit rest thee now while with ours thy footsteps trod his seal was on thy brow dust to its narrow house beneath soul to its place on high they that have seen thy look in no more may fear to die 623 song of the indian maid o sorrow why dost the natural hue of health from vermeil lips to give maiden to the white rose bushes or is it thy dewy hand the daisy tips o sorrow why dost the lustrous passion from a falcon eye to give the glow worm light or on a moonless night to tinge on siren shores the salt sea spry 623 sea spry sea spray o sorrow why dost the mellow ditties from a mourning tongue to give at evening unto the nightingale that thou mayst listen the cold dews among o sorrow why dost lightness from the merriment of may a lover would not a cowslip on the head though he should dance from eve till peep of day nor any drooping held sacred for thy bower wherever he may sport himself and play to i bade good morrow and thought to leave her far away behind but cheerly cheerly she loves me dearly she is so constant to me and so kind i would deceive her and so leave her but ah she is so constant and so kind beneath my palm trees by the river side i sat a weeping in the whole world there was no one to ask me why i wept and so i brimming the water lily cups with cold as my fears beneath my palm trees by the river side i sat a weeping what bride cheated by shadowy wooer from the clouds but hides and beneath dark palm trees by a river side and as i sat over the light blue there came a noise of revellers the into the wide stream came of purple hue bacchus and his crew the earnest trumpet spake and silver from kissing cymbals made a merry din bacchus and his kin like to a moving vintage down they came with green leaves and faces all on flame all madly dancing through the pleasant valley to scare thee melancholy o then o then thou wast a simple name and i forgot thee as the berried by shepherds is forgotten when in tall chestnuts keep away the sun and moon i into the folly within his car aloft young bacchus stood trifling his ivy dart in dancing mood with sidelong laughing and little rills of crimson wine his plump white arms and shoulders enough for pearly bite and near him rode silenus on his ass pelted with flowers as he on did tipsily quaffing came ye merry damsels whence came ye so many and so many and such glee why have ye left your bowers desolate your lutes and gentler fate follow bacchus bacchus on the wing a conquering bacchus young bacchus good or ill betide we dance before him thorough kingdoms wide come hither lady fair and joinèd to our wild minstrelsy came ye jolly satyrs whence came ye so many and so many and such glee why have ye left your forest haunts why your nuts in oak tree cleft wine for wine we left our kernel tree for wine we left our heath and yellow brooms and cold mushrooms for wine we follow bacchus through the earth great god of breathless cups and chirping mirth come hither lady fair and joinèd to our mad minstrelsy over wide streams and mountains great we went and save when bacchus kept his ivy tent onward the tiger and the leopard pants with asian elephants onward these myriads with song and dance with zebras striped and sleek prance web footed alligators crocodiles bearing upon their scaly backs in files plump infant laughers mimicking the of seamen and stout galley toil with toying oars and silken sails they glide nor care for wind and tide mounted on furs and manes from rear to van they scour about the plains a three journey in a moment done and always at the rising of the sun about the wilds they hunt with spear and horn on spleenful unicorn i saw osirian egypt kneel before the vine wreath crown i saw abyssinia rouse and to the silver ring i saw the whelming vintage hotly old tartary the fierce the kings of ind their jewel sceptres vail and from their treasures scatter pearlèd hail great brahma from his mystic heaven groans and all his priesthood moans before young eye wink turning pale into these regions came i following him sick hearted weary so i took a to stray away into these forests drear alone without a peer and i have told thee all thou mayest hear young stranger been a in search of pleasure throughout every clime alas not for me i sure must be to lose in grieving all my maiden prime come then sorrow sweetest sorrow like an own babe i nurse thee on my breast i thought to leave thee and deceive thee but now of all the world i love thee best there is not one no no not but thee to comfort a poor lonely maid thou art her mother and her brother her playmate and her wooer in the shade 624 ode to a nightingale my heart aches and a drowsy numbness my sense as though of hemlock i had drunk or emptied some dull opiate to the one minute past and lethe wards had sunk not through envy of thy happy lot but being too happy in thy happiness that thou light wingèd dryad of the trees in some melodious of beechen green and shadows numberless singest of summer in full throated ease o for a draught of vintage that hath a long age in the deep delvèd earth tasting of flora and the country green dance and provençal song and sunburnt mirth o for a beaker full of the warm south full of the true the blushful hippocrene with beaded bubbles winking at the brim and purple stainèd mouth that i might drink and leave the world unseen and with thee fade away into the forest dim fade far away dissolve and quite what thou among the leaves hast never known the weariness the fever and the here where men sit and hear each other groan where palsy shakes a few sad last grey hairs where youth grows pale and spectre thin and dies where but to think is to be full of and leaden eyed despairs where beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes or new love pine at them beyond to morrow away away for i will fly to thee not charioted by bacchus and his pards but on the viewless wings of poesy though the dull brain perplexes and retards already with thee tender is the night and haply the queen moon is on her throne around by all her starry but here there is no light save what from heaven is with the breezes through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways i cannot see what flowers are at my feet nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs but in embalmèd darkness guess each wherewith the seasonable month the grass the thicket and the fruit tree wild white hawthorn and the pastoral eglantine fast fading violets up in leaves and mid eldest child the coming musk rose full of dewy wine the murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves darkling i listen and for many a i have been half in love with easeful death him soft names in many a musèd rhyme to take into the air my quiet breath now more than ever seems it rich to die to cease upon the midnight with no pain while thou art pouring forth thy soul in such an ecstasy still wouldst thou sing and i have ears in vain to thy high requiem become a sod thou wast not born for death immortal bird no hungry generations tread thee down the voice i hear this passing night was in ancient days by emperor and clown perhaps the self same song that found a through the sad heart of ruth when sick for home she stood in tears amid the alien corn the same that ofttimes magic casements opening on the of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn forlorn the very word is like a to toll me back from thee to my sole self adieu the fancy cannot cheat so as she is famed to do deceiving elf adieu adieu thy plaintive anthem past the near meadows over the still stream up the hill side and now buried in the next valley glades was it a vision or a waking dream fled is that music do i wake or sleep 625 ode on a grecian urn thou still bride of quietness thou foster child of silence and slow time sylvan historian who canst thus a flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme what leaf fringed legend haunts about thy of deities or mortals or of both in tempe or the dales of arcady what men or gods are these what maidens loth what mad pursuit what struggle to escape what pipes and timbrels what wild ecstasy heard melodies are sweet but those are sweeter therefore ye soft pipes play on not to the sensual ear but more pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone fair youth beneath the trees thou canst not thy song nor ever can those trees be bare bold lover never never canst thou kiss though winning near the goal yet do not grieve she cannot fade though thou hast not thy bliss for ever wilt thou love and she be fair ah happy happy boughs that cannot your leaves nor ever bid the spring adieu and happy melodist unwearièd for ever piping songs for ever new more happy love more happy happy love for ever warm and still to be for ever panting and for ever young all breathing human passion far above that leaves a heart high sorrowful and a burning forehead and a parching tongue who are these coming to the sacrifice to what green altar o mysterious priest thou that heifer lowing at the skies and all her silken flanks with garlands drest what little town by river or sea shore or mountain built with peaceful citadel is emptied of its folk this pious morn and little town thy streets for will silent be and not a soul to why thou art desolate can return o attic shape fair attitude with of marble men and maidens overwrought with forest branches and the trodden weed thou silent form dost tease us out of as doth eternity cold pastoral when old age shall this generation waste thou shalt remain in midst of other than ours a friend to man to whom thou is truth truth beauty that is ye know on earth and all ye need to know 626 ode to psyche o goddess hear these tuneless numbers by sweet enforcement and remembrance dear and pardon that thy secrets should be even into thine own soft conchèd ear surely i to day or did i the wingèd psyche with eyes i in a forest thoughtlessly and on the sudden fainting with surprise saw two fair creatures couchèd side by in deepest grass beneath the of leaves and trembled blossoms where there a brooklet scarce espied cool rooted flowers fragrant eyed blue silver white and budded they lay calm breathing on the bedded grass their arms embracèd and their pinions too their lips not but had not bade adieu as if disjoinèd by soft handed slumber and ready still past kisses to at tender eye dawn of aurorean love the wingèd boy i knew but who wast thou o happy happy dove his psyche true o latest born and loveliest vision of all faded hierarchy fairer than sapphire star or vesper amorous glow worm of the sky fairer than these though temple thou hast none nor altar with flowers nor virgin choir to make delicious upon the midnight hours no voice no lute no pipe no incense from chain swung censer teeming no shrine no grove no oracle no of pale prophet dreaming o brightest though too late for antique vows too too late for the fond believing lyre when holy were the haunted forest boughs holy the air the water and the fire yet even in these days so far from happy pieties thy lucent fans fluttering among the faint olympians i see and sing by my own eyes inspired so let me be thy choir and make a upon the midnight hours thy voice thy lute thy pipe thy incense from swingèd censer teeming thy shrine thy grove thy oracle thy of pale prophet dreaming yes i will be thy priest and build a in some untrodden region of my mind where branchèd thoughts new grown with pleasant pain instead of pines shall murmur in the wind far far around shall those dark fledge the wild ridgèd mountains steep by steep and there by zephyrs streams and birds and bees the moss lain dryads shall be to sleep and in the midst of this wide a rosy sanctuary will i with the trellis of a working brain with buds and bells and stars without a name with all the gardener fancy could feign who breeding flowers will never breed the same and there shall be for thee all soft that shadowy thought can win a bright torch and a casement ope at night to let the warm love in 627 to autumn season of mists and mellow fruitfulness close bosom friend of the maturing sun conspiring with him how to load and with fruit the vines that round the thatch eaves run to bend with apples the cottage trees and fill all fruit with ripeness to the core to swell the gourd and plump the hazel with a sweet kernel to set budding more and still more later flowers for the bees until they think warm days will never cease for summer has their clammy cells who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store sometimes whoever seeks abroad may thee sitting careless on a granary floor thy hair soft lifted by the winnowing wind or on a half furrow sound asleep drowsed with the fume of poppies while thy spares the next swath and all its twinèd flowers and sometimes like a gleaner thou dost steady thy laden head across a brook or by a cider press with patient look thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours where are the songs of spring ay where are they think not of them thou hast thy music too while barrèd clouds bloom the soft dying day and touch the stubble plains with rosy hue then in a wailful choir the small gnats among the river sallows borne or sinking as the light wind lives or dies and full grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn hedge crickets sing and now with treble the redbreast whistles from a garden croft and gathering swallows twitter in the skies 628 ode on melancholy no no go not to lethe neither bane tight rooted for its poisonous wine nor suffer thy pale forehead to be by nightshade ruby grape of proserpine make not your rosary of yew berries nor let the beetle nor the death moth your mournful psyche nor the downy a partner in your mysteries for shade to shade will come too drowsily and drown the wakeful anguish of the soul but when the melancholy fit shall sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud that fosters the droop headed flowers all and hides the green hill in an april shroud then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose or on the rainbow of the salt sand wave or on the wealth of globèd peonies or if thy mistress some rich anger shows emprison her soft hand and let her rave and feed deep deep upon her peerless eyes she dwells with beauty beauty that must die and joy whose hand is ever at his bidding adieu and aching pleasure nigh turning to poison while the bee mouth sips ay in the very temple of melancholy has her sovran shrine though seen of none save him whose strenuous can burst grape against his palate fine his soul shall taste the sadness of her might and be among her cloudy trophies hung 629 fragment of an ode to maia written on may day 1818 mother of hermes and still youthful maia may i sing to as thou wast hymnèd on the shores of baiæ or may i woo in earlier sicilian or thy seek as they once were sought in grecian isles by bards who died content on pleasant sward leaving great verse unto a little clan o give me their old vigour and save of the quiet primrose and the of heaven and few ears rounded by thee my song should die content as theirs rich in the simple worship of a day 630 bards of passion and of mirth written on the blank page before beaumont and tragi fair maid of the bards of passion and of mirth ye have left your souls on earth have ye souls in heaven too doubled lived in regions new yes and those of heaven with the spheres of sun and moon with the noise of fountains wondrous and the parle of voices with the whisper of and one another in soft seated on elysian browsed by none but fawns underneath large blue bells tented where the daisies are rose scented and the rose herself has perfume which on earth is not where the nightingale doth not a senseless trancèd thing but divine melodious truth philosophic numbers smooth tales and golden of heaven and its mysteries thus ye live on high and on the earth ye live again and the souls ye left behind teach us here the way to find you where your other souls are joying never never cloying here your earth born souls still to mortals of their little week of their sorrows and delights of their passions and their spites of their glory and their shame what doth strengthen and what maim thus ye teach us every day wisdom though fled far away bards of passion and of mirth ye have left your souls on earth ye have souls in heaven too double lived in regions new 631 fancy ever let the fancy roam pleasure never is at home at a touch sweet pleasure melteth like to bubbles when rain pelteth then let wingèd fancy through the thought still spread beyond her open wide the cage door dart forth and cloudward soar o sweet fancy let her loose joys are spoilt by use and the enjoying of the fades as does its blossoming red fruitage too blushing through the mist and dew cloys with tasting what do then sit thee by the ingle the sear faggot blazes bright spirit of a night when the soundless earth is muffled and the cakèd snow is from the heavy shoon when the night doth meet the in a dark to banish even from her sky sit thee there and send abroad with a mind self overawed fancy high send her she has vassals to attend her she will bring in spite of frost beauties that the earth hath lost she will bring thee all together all delights of summer weather all the buds and bells of may from dewy sward or thorny spray all the heapèd wealth with a still mysterious stealth she will mix these pleasures like three fit wines in a cup and thou shalt quaff it thou shalt distant harvest carols clear rustle of the reapèd corn sweet birds antheming the morn and in the same moment hark the early april lark or the rooks with busy caw foraging for sticks and straw thou shalt at one glance the daisy and the marigold white plumed lilies and the hedge grown primrose that hath burst shaded hyacinth sapphire queen of the mid may and every leaf and every pearlèd with the self same shower thou shalt see the fieldmouse meagre from its cellèd sleep and the snake all winter cast on sunny bank its skin freckled nest eggs thou shalt hatching in the hawthorn tree when the hen wing doth quiet on her mossy nest then the hurry and when the beehive casts its swarm acorns ripe down while the autumn breezes sing o sweet fancy let her loose every thing is spoilt by use the cheek that doth not fade too much gazed at the whose lip mature is ever new the eye however blue doth not weary the one would meet in every place the voice however soft one would hear so very oft at a touch sweet pleasure like to bubbles when rain pelteth let then wingèd fancy thee a mistress to thy mind dulcet eyed as daughter ere the god of torment taught how to frown and how to chide with a waist and with a white as when her slipt its golden clasp and fell her kirtle to her feet while she held the goblet sweet and jove grew languid break the of the silken leash quickly break her prison string and such joys as these bring let the wingèd fancy roam pleasure never is at home 632 stanzas in a drear nighted december too happy happy tree thy branches their green felicity the north cannot undo them with a sleety whistle through them nor frozen thawings glue from budding at the prime in a drear nighted december too happy happy brook thy bubblings summer look but with a sweet forgetting they stay their crystal fretting never never about the frozen time ah would so with a gentle girl and boy but were there ever writhed not at passèd joy to know the change and feel it when there is none to heal it nor numbèd sense to steal it was never said in rhyme 633 la belle dame sans merci what can ail thee knight at arms alone and palely loitering the sedge is from the lake and no birds sing what can ail thee knight at arms so haggard and so woe begone the granary is full and the done see a lily on thy with anguish moist and fever dew and on thy cheek a fading fast withereth too met a lady in the meads full beautiful a child her hair was long her foot was light and her eyes were wild made a garland for her head and bracelets too and fragrant zone she at me as she did love and made sweet moan set her on my pacing and nothing else saw all day long for sideways would she lean and a song found me roots of relish sweet and honey wild and manna dew and sure in language strange she said love thee true took me to her elfin grot and there she wept and full sore and there i shut her wild wild with kisses four there she lullèd me asleep and there i ah woe betide the latest dream i ever on the cold side saw pale kings and princes too pale warriors death pale were they all who cried belle dame sans hath thee in thrall saw their starved lips in the with horrid warning gapèd wide and i awoke and found me on the cold side this is why i sojourn alone and palely loitering though the sedge is from the lake and no birds sing 634 on first looking into homer much have i in the realms of gold and many goodly states and kingdoms seen round many western islands have i which bards in fealty to apollo hold oft of one wide expanse had i been that deep homer ruled as his demesne yet did i never breathe its pure till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold then felt i like some watcher of the when a new planet swims into his ken or like stout cortez when with eagle he stared at the pacific and all his at each other with a wild surmise silent upon a peak in darien 635 when i have fears that i may cease to be when i have fears that i may cease to before my pen has my teeming brain before high pilèd books in hold like full garners the full grain when i behold upon the face huge cloudy symbols of a high romance and feel that i may never live to their shadows with the magic hand of chance and when i feel fair creature of an hour that i shall never look upon thee more never have relish in the faery of unreflecting love then on the of the wide world i stand alone and think till love and fame to nothingness do sink 636 to sleep o soft embalmer of the still midnight shutting with careful fingers and our gloom pleased eyes from the light enshaded in forgetfulness divine o soothest sleep if so it please thee close in midst of this thine hymn my willing eyes or wait the amen ere thy poppy around my bed its lulling charities then save me or the passèd day will upon my pillow breeding many woes save me from curious conscience that still its strength for darkness burrowing like a mole turn the key deftly in the oilèd wards and seal the hushèd casket of my soul 637 last sonnet bright star would i were steadfast as thou art not in lone splendour hung aloft the night and watching with eternal lids apart like patient sleepless eremite the moving waters at their priest like of pure ablution round human shores or gazing on the new soft fallen of snow upon the mountains and the moors no yet still steadfast still unchangeable upon my fair ripening breast to feel for ever its soft fall and swell awake for ever in a sweet unrest still still to hear her tender taken breath and so live ever or else swoon to death joseph 638 the outlaw of loch lene the o many a day have i made good ale in the glen that came not of stream or malt like the brewing of men my bed was the ground my roof the green wood above and the wealth that i sought one far kind glance from my love alas on that night when the horses i drove from the field that i was not near from terror my angel to shield she forth her arms her mantle she flung to the wind and swam loch lene her lover to find o would that a freezing sleet tempest did sweep and i and my love were alone far off on the deep ask not a ship or a bark or a pinnace to save with her hand round my waist fear not the wind or the wave down by the lake where the wild tree fringes its sides the maid of my heart my fair one of heaven resides i think as at eve she wanders its mazes among the birds go to sleep by the sweet wild twist of her song sidney 639 too solemn for day too sweet for night come not in darkness come not in light but come in some twilight interim when the gloom is soft and the light is dim 640 song sweet in her green dell the flower of beauty slumbers by the faint breezes sighing through her hair sleeps she and hears not the melancholy breathed to my sad lute the lonely air down from the high cliffs the rivulet is to wind round the willow banks that lure him from above o that in tears from my rocky prison streaming i too could glide to the bower of my love ah where the woodbines with sleepy arms have wound her opes she her eyelids at the dream of my lay listening like the dove while the fountains echo round her to her lost call in the forests far away come then my bird for the peace thou ever bearest still messenger of comfort to me come this fond bosom o faithfullest and fairest bleeds with its death wound its wound of love for thee 641 to helene on a gift ring carelessly lost i sent a ring a little of emerald and ruby stone and bade it sparkling on thy hand tell thee sweet tales of whose constant was full of loveliness and thee a shell was graven on its gold cupid without his wings to helene once it would have more than was ever told by rings but now past and gone her love is buried with that stone thou shalt not see the tears that from eyes by thoughts like these beguiled thou shalt not know the beating heart ever a victim and a child yet helene love the heart that never could deceive hear thy voice of in the sweet whispers of the air see the brightness of thine in the blue dewy star in crystal streams thy purity and look on heaven to look on thee 642 the fallen star a star is gone a star is gone there is a blank in heaven one of the cherub choir has his airy course this even he sat upon the orb of that hung for ages there and lent his music to the that haunts the nightly air but when his thousand years are with a cherubic he with his car at last for even cherubs die hear how his angel brothers mourn the minstrels of the spheres each chiming sadly in his and dropping splendid tears the planetary sisters join in the fatal song and weep this hapless fall who sang with them so long but deepest of the choral the lunar spirit sings and with a bass according sweeps all her sullen strings from the deep chambers of the where sleepless uriel lies his rude harmonic thunders mingled with mighty sighs the thousand car borne cherubim the wandering eleven all join to chant the dirge of who fell just now from heaven 643 the solitary hearted she was a queen of noble crowning a smile of hers was like an act of grace she had no winsome looks no pretty frowning like daily beauties of the vulgar race but if she smiled a light was on her face a clear cool kindliness a lunar of peaceful radiance silvering the of human thought with unabiding glory not quite a waking truth not quite a dream a visitation bright and transitory but she is changed hath felt the touch of sorrow no love hath she no understanding friend o grief when heaven is forced of earth to what the poor niggard earth has not to lend but when the stalk is snapt the rose must bend the tallest flower that skyward rears its grows from the common ground and there must its delicate petals cruel fate too surely that they should find so base a bridal bed who lived in virgin pride so sweet and purely she had a brother and a tender father and she was loved but not as others from whom we ask return of love but as one might love a dream a phantom of something exquisitely strange and rare which all were glad to look on men and maids yet no one as oft in dewy glades the peering primrose like a sudden gladness gleams on the soul yet unregarded fades the joy is ours but all its own the sadness vain to say her worst of grief is the common lot which all the world have known to her more because her heart is lonely and yet she hath no strength to stand alone once she had playmates fancies of her own and she did love them they are past as fairies vanish at the break of day and like a spectre of an age departed or unsphered angel wofully astray she glides along the solitary hearted 644 song she is not fair to outward as many maidens be her loveliness i never until she smiled on me o then i saw her eye was bright a well of love a spring of light but now her looks are coy and cold to mine they reply and yet i cease not to the love light in her eye her very frowns are fairer than smiles of other maidens are 645 early death she away like morning before the sun was high so brief her time she scarcely the meaning of a sigh as round the rose its soft perfume sweet love around her floated admired she grew while mortal crept on unnoted love was her guardian angel here but love to death her love was kind why should we but holy death is kinder 646 friendship when we were idlers with the loitering rills the need of human love we little noted our love was nature and the peace that on the white mist and dwelt upon the hills to sweet accord subdued our wayward wills one soul was ours one mind one heart devoted that wisely doting not why it doted and ours the unknown joy which knowing kills but now i find how dear thou wert to me that man is more than half of treasure of that fair beauty which no eye can see of that sweet music which no ear can measure and now the streams may sing for pleasure the hills sleep on in their eternity 647 autumn i saw old autumn in the misty stand shadowless like silence to silence for no lonely bird would into his hollow ear from woods forlorn nor lowly hedge nor solitary thorn shaking his languid locks all dewy with tangled gossamer that fell by night pearling his coronet of golden corn where are the songs of summer with the sun oping the dusky eyelids of the south till shade and silence waken up as one and morning sings with a warm odorous mouth where are the merry birds away away on panting wings through the inclement skies lest owls should undazzled at noonday and tear with horny beak their lustrous eyes where are the blooms of summer in the west blushing their last to the last sunny hours when the mild eve by sudden night is like tearful proserpine from her to a most gloomy breast where is the pride of summer the green prime the many many leaves all twinkling on the elm three on the naked trembling and one upon the old oak tree where is the immortality gone into mournful cypress and dark yew or wearing the long gloomy winter in the smooth green eternity the squirrel gloats on his accomplished hoard the ants have their garners with ripe grain and honey bees have the sweets of summer in their luscious cells the swallows all have across the main but here the autumn melancholy dwells and sighs her tearful amongst the sunless shadows of the plain alone alone upon a mossy stone she sits and reckons up the dead and with the last leaves for a love rosary whilst all the world looks drearily like a dim picture of the drownèd in the mysterious far away doubtful what ghostly thing will steal the into that distance gray upon the gray o go and sit with her and be under the languid downfall of her hair she wears a coronal of flowers upon her forehead and a face of care there is enough of to make her bower and enough of gloom there is enough of sadness to invite if only for the rose that died whose is she that with the living of conscious cheeks most beautifies the light there is enough of sorrowing and enough of bitter fruits the earth doth bear enough of chilly droppings for her bowl enough of fear and shadowy despair to frame her cloudy prison for the soul 648 silence there is a silence where hath been no sound there is a silence where no sound may be in the cold grave under the deep deep sea or in wide desert where no life is found which hath been mute and still must sleep profound no voice is no life treads silently but clouds and cloudy shadows wander free that never spoke over the idle ground but in green ruins in the desolate of antique palaces where man hath been though the dun fox or wild hyæna calls and owls that flit continually between shriek to the echo and the low winds moan there the true silence is self conscious and alone 649 death it is not death that sometime in a this eloquent breath shall take its speechless flight that sometime these bright stars that now in sunlight to the sun shall set in night that this warm conscious flesh shall perish quite and all ruddy springs forget to flow that thoughts shall cease and the immortal be in alien clay and laid below it is not death to know this but to that pious thoughts which visit at new in tender pilgrimage will cease to so duly and so oft and when grass over the away there may be no resurrection in the minds of men 650 fair ines o saw ye not fair ines gone into the west to dazzle when the sun is down and rob the world of rest she took our daylight with her the smiles that we love best with morning blushes on her cheek and pearls upon her breast o turn again fair ines before the fall of night for fear the moon should shine alone and stars bright and blessèd will the lover that walks beneath their light and breathes the love against thy i dare not even write would i had been fair ines that gallant cavalier who rode so gaily by thy side and thee so near were there no bonny dames at home or no true lovers here that he should cross the seas to the dearest of the dear i saw thee lovely ines descend along the shore with bands of noble gentlemen and banners waved before and gentle youth and maidens gay and snowy plumes they wore it would have been a beauteous dream if it had been no more alas alas fair ines she went away with song with music waiting on her steps and shoutings of the throng but some were sad and felt no mirth but only wrong in sounds that sang farewell farewell to her loved so long farewell farewell fair ines that vessel never so fair a lady on its deck nor danced so light before alas for pleasure on the sea and sorrow on the shore the smile that one has broken many more 651 time of roses it was not in the our loving lot was cast it was the time of roses we them as we that churlish season never on early lovers yet o no the world was newly with flowers when first we met twilight and i bade you go but still you held me fast it was the time of roses we them as we 652 ruth she stood breast high amid the corn by the golden light of morn like the sweetheart of the sun who many a glowing kiss had won on her cheek an autumn flush deeply such a in the midst of brown was born like red poppies grown with corn round her eyes her tresses fell which were blackest none could tell but long lashes veiled a light that had else been all too bright and her hat with shady brim made her tressy forehead dim thus she stood amid the stooks praising god with sweetest looks sure i said did not mean where i reap thou shouldst but glean lay thy sheaf adown and come share my harvest and my home 653 the death bed we her breathing the night her breathing soft and low as in her breast the wave of kept heaving to and fro so silently we to speak so slowly moved about as we had lent her half our to eke her living out our very hopes belied our fears our fears our hopes belied we thought her dying when she slept and sleeping when she died for when the morn came dim and sad and chill with early showers her quiet eyelids closed she another morn than ours 654 the bridge of sighs one more unfortunate weary of breath rashly importunate gone to her death take her up tenderly lift her with care so young and so fair look at her clinging like cerements whilst the wave drips from her clothing take her up instantly loving not loathing touch her not scornfully think of her mournfully gently and humanly not of the stains of her all that remains of now is pure womanly make no deep into her rash and undutiful past all dishonour death has left on only the beautiful still for all slips of hers one of family wipe those poor lips of oozing so clammily loop up her escaped from the comb her fair auburn tresses whilst wonderment where was her home who was her father who was her mother had she a sister had she a brother or was there a dearer still and a nearer yet

eminence even seeming estranged where the lamps so far in the river with many a from window and casement from garret to basement she stood with amazement houseless by night the bleak wind of made her tremble and shiver but not the dark arch or the black flowing river mad from history glad to mystery swift to be anywhere out of the world in she plunged boldly no matter how the rough river ran over the brink of it picture it think of it dissolute man lave in it drink of it then if you can take her up tenderly lift her with care so slenderly young and so fair ere her limbs stiffen too rigidly decently kindly smooth and compose them and her eyes close them staring so blindly dreadfully muddy impurity as when with the last look of on futurity perishing gloomily by contumely cold inhumanity burning insanity into her rest cross her hands as if praying dumbly over her breast owning her weakness her evil behaviour and leaving with meekness her sins to her saviour 655 the blind pranks men

his griefs and gloom no star of all heaven sends to light path to the tomb roll on my song and to after tell how disdaining all earth can give he would have taught men from pages the way to live and tell how trampled derided hated and worn by weakness disease and wrong he fled for shelter to god who his soul with song with song which alway sublime or vapid like a rill in the morning beam perchance not deep but intense and rapid a mountain stream tell how this nameless for years to herd with demons from hell beneath saw things that made him with groans and tears for even death go on to tell how with genius wasted in friendship in love with spirit and young hopes blasted he still still strove till spent with toil dreeing death for and some whose hands should have wrought for him if children live not for sires and mothers his mind grew dim and he fell far through that pit abysmal the gulf and grave of maginn and burns and his soul for the stock of returns but yet redeemed it in days of darkness and shapes and signs of the final wrath when death in hideous and ghastly starkness stood on his path and tell how now amid wreck and sorrow and want and sickness and houseless nights he bides in calmness the silent morrow that no ray lights and lives he still then yes old and at thirty nine from despair and woe he lives enduring what future will never know him grant a grave to ye pitying noble deep in your bosoms there let him dwell he too had tears for all souls in trouble here and in hell lovell 666 dirge if thou wilt ease thine of love and all its smart then sleep dear

days departed how often underneath the with childish bounds i used to to a garden long deserted the beds and walks were quite and had struck the spade the greenest grasses nature laid to sanctify her right i the place my wilderness for no one there but i the sheep in the grass to espy and it the trees were interwoven wild and spread their boughs enough to keep both sheep and shepherd out but not a happy child adventurous joy it was for me i crept beneath the boughs and a circle smooth of mossy beneath a poplar tree old garden rose trees hedged it in bedropt with roses waxen white well satisfied with dew and light and careless to be seen long years ago it might befall when all the garden flowers were trim the grave old gardener prided on these the most of all some lady stately overmuch here moving with a silken noise has beside them at the that her to such or these to make a diadem she often may have and twined half smiling as it came to mind that few would look at them o little thought that lady proud a child would watch her fair white rose when buried lay her whiter brows and silk was changed for shroud nor thought that gardener full of for men and simple phrase a child would bring it all its praise by creeping through the thorns to me upon my low moss seat though never a dream the roses of science or compliment i ween they smelt as sweet it did not move my grief to the trace of human step departed because the garden was deserted the blither place for me friends blame me not a narrow hath childhood the sun and sward we draw the moral afterward we feel the gladness then and gladdest hours for me did in silence at the rose tree wall a thrush made gladness upon the other side nor he nor i did to peck or pluck the blossoms white how should i know but that they lead lives as glad as mine to make my hermit home complete i brought clear water from the praised in its own low murmuring and cresses glossy wet and so i thought my likeness without the melancholy tale to hermit of the dale and angelina too for oft i read within my such minstrel stories till the made sounds poetic in the trees and then i shut the book if i shut this wherein i write i hear no more the wind those trees nor feel that childish delighting in delight my childhood from my life is parted my footstep from the moss which its fairy circle round the garden is deserted another thrush may there the madrigals which sweetest are no more for me myself do sing a sadder verse ah me ah me when erst i in that nest so greenly wrought i unto myself and thought time will pass away and still i and did not but that was the childish time some happier my womanhood would cheer i knew the time would pass away and yet beside the rose tree wall dear god how seldom if at all did i look up to pray the time is past and now that the cypress high among the trees and i behold white as well as the white rose when wiser meeker thoughts are given and i have learnt to lift my face reminded how greenest the colour draws from heaven it something saith for earthly pain but more for heavenly promise free that i who was would shrink to that happy child again 680 consolation all are not taken there are left living belovèds tender looks to and make the daylight still a happy thing and tender voices to make soft the wind but if it were not so if i could no love in all this world for comforting nor any path but hollowly did where to the love from life and if before those sepulchres i stood alone as some forsaken goes bleating up the moors in weary dearth crying are ye o my loved and loving i know a voice would sound i am can i suffice for heaven and not for earth 681 grief i tell you hopeless grief is passionless that only men incredulous of despair half taught in anguish through the midnight beat upward to throne in loud of shrieking and reproach full in souls as countries lieth silent under the blanching vertical eye of the absolute heavens deep hearted man grief for thy dead in silence like to death most like a monumental statue in everlasting watch and moveless till itself crumble to the dust beneath touch it the marble eyelids are not wet if it could weep it could arise and go sonnets from the portuguese 682 i i thought once how theocritus had of the sweet years the dear and for years who each one in a gracious hand to bear a gift for mortals old or young and as i mused it in his antique tongue i saw in gradual vision through my the sweet sad years the melancholy years those of my own life who by turns had a shadow across me straightway i was so weeping how a mystic shape did behind me and drew me backward by the hair and a voice said in mastery while i strove now who holds thee i said but the silver answer rang not death but love 683 ii unlike are we unlike o princely heart unlike our uses and our destinies our ministering two angels look on one another as they strike their wings in passing thou bethink thee a guest for queens to social pageantries with gages from a hundred brighter than tears even can make mine to play thy of chief musician what hast thou to with looking from the lattice lights at me a poor tired wandering singer singing the dark and leaning up a cypress tree the chrism is on thine head on mine the dew and death must dig the level where these agree 684 iii go from me yet i feel that i shall henceforward in thy shadow alone upon the threshold of my of individual life i shall the uses of my soul nor lift my serenely in the sunshine as before without the sense of that which i forbore thy touch upon the palm the widest doom takes to part us leaves thy heart in with pulses that beat double what i and what i dream include thee as the must taste of its own grapes and when i god for myself he hears that name of thine and sees within my eyes the tears of two 685 iv if thou must love me let it be for except for sake only do not say love her for her smile her look her of speaking gently for a trick of that falls in well with mine and certes a sense of pleasant ease on such a day for these things in themselves belovèd be changed or change for thee and love so wrought may be unwrought so neither love me thine own dear wiping my cheeks dry a creature might forget to weep who thy comfort long and lose thy love thereby but love me for sake that thou mayst love on through eternity 686 v when our two souls stand up erect and strong face to face silent drawing nigh and nigher until the lengthening wings break into at either curving point what bitter can the earth do us that we should not be here contented think in mounting higher the angels would press on us and to drop some golden orb of perfect into our deep dear silence let us rather on earth belovèd where the contrarious moods of men recoil and isolate pure spirits and a place to stand and love in for a day with darkness and the death hour rounding it 687 a musical instrument what was he doing the great god pan down in the reeds by the river spreading ruin and scattering ban splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat and breaking the golden lilies with the dragon fly on the river he tore out a reed the great god pan from the deep cool bed of the river the limpid water turbidly ran and the broken lilies a dying lay and the dragon fly had fled away ere he brought it out of the river high on the shore sat the great god pan while turbidly the river and and as a great god with his hard bleak steel at the patient reed till there was not a sign of the leaf to prove it fresh from the river he cut it short did the great god how tall it stood in the river then drew the pith like the heart of a man steadily from the outside ring and the poor dry empty in holes as he sat by the river is the the great god while he sat by the river only way since gods to make sweet music they could succeed then dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed he blew in power by the river sweet sweet sweet o pan piercing sweet by the river blinding sweet o great god pan the sun on the hill forgot to die and the lilies revived and the dragon came back to dream on the river yet half a beast is the great god pan to laugh as he sits by the river making a poet out of a man the true gods sigh for the cost and pain for the reed which grows nevermore as a reed with the reeds of the river 688 the holy tide the days are sad it is the holy tide the winter morn is short the night is long so let the lifeless hours be with deathless thoughts and in sweet song and through the sunset of this purple they will resume the roses of their prime and the old dead will hear us and wake up pass with dim smiles and make our hearts sublime the days are sad it is the holy tide be dusky mistletoes and hollies strown sharp as the spear that pierced his sacred side red as the drops upon his thorny crown no haggard passion and no lawless fright off the solemn muse tell sweet old tales sing songs as we sit brooding the hearth till the lamp flickers and the memory fails wadsworth 689 my lost youth often i think of the beautiful that is seated by the sea often in thought go up and the pleasant streets of that dear old town and my youth comes back to me and a verse of a lapland is haunting my memory still will is the will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts i can see the shadowy lines of its trees and catch in sudden gleams the sheen of the far surrounding seas and islands that were the of all my boyish dreams and the burden of that old song it murmurs and whispers still will is the will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts i remember the black wharves and the slips and the sea tides tossing free and spanish sailors with bearded lips and the beauty and mystery of the ships and the magic of the sea and the voice of that wayward is singing and saying still will is the will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts i remember the bulwarks by the shore and the fort upon the hill the sunrise gun with its hollow roar the drum beat repeated and and the bugle wild and shrill and the music of that old throbs in my memory still will is the will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts i remember the sea fight far away how it the tide and the dead sea captains as they in their graves the tranquil where they in battle died and the sound of that mournful goes through me with a thrill will is the will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts i can see the breezy dome of groves the shadows of woods and the friendships old and the early come back with a sabbath sound as of in quiet neighbourhoods and the verse of that sweet old song it flutters and murmurs still will is the will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts i remember the gleams and glooms that across the brain the song and the silence in the heart that in part are prophecies and in are longings wild and vain and the voice of that fitful sings on and is never still will is the will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts there are things of which i may not speak there are dreams that cannot die there are thoughts that make the strong heart weak and bring a pallor into the cheek and a mist before the eye and the words of that fatal come over me like a chill will is the will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts strange to me now are the forms i when i visit the dear old town but the native air is pure and sweet and the trees that each well known street as they balance up and down are singing the beautiful song are sighing and whispering still will is the will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts and woods are fresh and fair and with joy that is almost my heart goes back to wander there and among the dreams of the days that i find my lost youth again and the strange and beautiful song the groves are repeating it still will is the will and the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts greenleaf 690 vesta o christ of god whose life and our own have reconciled most quietly most take

is green again but i miss the soft clasp of your hand and your breath warm on my cheek and i still keep for the you never more will speak but a step down yonder lane and the little church stands near the church where we were wed mary i see the spire from here but the graveyard lies between mary and my step might break your rest for laid you darling down to sleep with your baby on your breast very lonely now mary for the poor make no new friends but o they love the better still the few our father sends and you were all i had mary my and my pride left to care for now since my poor mary died yours was the good brave heart mary that still kept hoping on when the trust in god had left my soul and my young strength was gone there was comfort ever on your lip and the kind look on your brow i bless you mary for that same though you cannot hear me now i thank you for the patient when your heart was fit to break when the hunger pain was there and you hid it for my sake i bless you for the pleasant word when your heart was sad and sore o thankful you are gone mary where grief reach you more you a long farewell my mary kind and true but not forget you darling in the land to they say bread and work for all and the sun shines always there but not forget old ireland were it fifty times as fair and often in those grand old sit and shut my eyes and my heart will travel back to the

no i do not love thee and yet when thou art absent i am sad and envy even the bright blue sky above thee whose quiet stars may see thee and be glad i do not love thee yet i know not why thou dost seems still well done to me and often in my solitude i that those i do love are not more like thee i do not love thee yet when thou art gone i hate the sound though those who speak be dear which breaks the lingering echo of the thy voice of music leaves upon my ear i do not love thee yet thy speaking eyes with their deep bright and most expressive blue between me and the midnight heaven arise oftener than any eyes i ever knew i know i do not love thee yet alas others will scarcely trust my candid heart and oft i catch them smiling as they pass because they see me gazing where thou art tennyson 693 globe when letty had scarce her third glad year and her young artless words began to flow one day we gave the child a of the wide earth that she might mark and know by tint and outline all its sea and land she patted all the world old empires between her baby fingers her soft was welcome at all frontiers how she and and prattled in her world wide bliss but when we her sweet unlearnèd on our own isle she raised a joyous cry yes i see it home is there and while she hid all england with a kiss bright over europe fell her golden hair allan 694 to helen helen thy beauty is to like those nicèan barks of that gently a perfumed sea the weary way worn wanderer to his own native shore on desperate seas long wont to roam thy hyacinth hair thy classic face thy naiad airs have

be loved by me i was a child and she was a in this kingdom by the sea but we loved with a love that was more than love i and my annabel lee with a love that the wingèd seraphs of coveted her and me and this was the reason that long ago in this kingdom by the sea a wind blew out of a cloud my beautiful annabel lee so that her high born kinsmen and bore her away from me to shut her up in a in this kingdom by the sea the angels not half so happy in heaven went envying her and me yes that was the reason as all men know in this kingdom by the sea that the wind came out of the cloud one night chilling and killing my annabel lee but our love it was stronger by far than the of those who were older than we of many far wiser than we and neither the angels in heaven above nor the demons down under the sea can ever dissever my soul from the of the beautiful annabel lee for the moon never beams without bringing me of the beautiful annabel lee and the stars never rise but i feel the bright of the beautiful annabel lee and so all the night tide i lie down by the of my darling my darling my life and my bride in the sepulchre there by the sea in her tomb by the sounding sea 696 for annie thank heaven the crisis the danger is past and the lingering is over at last and the fever called is at last sadly i i am shorn of my strength and no muscle i as i lie at full length but no matter i i am better at length and i rest so now in my bed that any might fancy me dead might start at beholding me thinking me dead the moaning and groaning the sighing and sobbing are quieted now with that horrible at heart ah that horrible horrible throbbing the sickness the nausea the pitiless pain have ceased with the that my brain with the fever called that in my brain and o of all that torture the has abated the torture of for the naphthaline of passion accurst i have drunk of a that quenches all thirst of a water that flows with a lullaby sound from a spring but a very feet under ground from a cavern not very down under ground and ah let it be foolishly that my room it is gloomy and narrow my bed for man never in a different bed and to sleep you must in just such a bed my tantalized here blandly reposes forgetting or regretting its roses its old of myrtles and roses for now while so lying it a holier about it of pansies a rosemary odour commingled with pansies with rue and the puritan pansies and so it lies happily bathing in a dream of the and the beauty of annie in a of the tresses of annie she tenderly me she fondly and then i fell to sleep on her breast deeply to from the heaven of her breast when the light was she me warm and she to the to keep me from harm to the queen of the to shield me from harm and i lie so composedly now in my knowing her love that you fancy me dead and i rest so contentedly now in my with her love at my breast that you fancy me dead that you shudder to look at me thinking me dead but my heart it is than all of the stars in the sky for it sparkles with annie it glows with the of the love of my annie with the thought of the of the eyes of my annie 697 old song a dull to see the year dying when winter set the yellow wood sighing sighing o sighing when such a time i do into an old beside a bright fire o pile a bright fire and there i reading old things of knights and lorn damsels while the wind sings o drearily sings i never look nor attend to the blast for all to be is the leaves falling fast falling falling but close at the hearth like a cricket sit i reading of and chivalry gallant chivalry then with an old i talk of our youth how gladsome but foolish forsooth but gladsome gladsome or to get merry we sing some old that made the wood ring in summer time sweet summer time then go we smoking silent and snug naught passes between us save a brown jug sometimes and sometimes a will rise in each eye seeing the two old so merrily so merrily and ere to go we go we down on the we kneel on the knee praying together thus then live till all the gloom by heaven the bold is with me in the shining shining then the clouds part swallows soaring between the spring is alive and the meadows are green i jump up like mad break the old pipe in twain and away to the meadows the meadows again 698 from omar khayyám a book of verses underneath the bough a jug of wine a loaf of bread and beside me singing in the wilderness o

say the lion and the lizard the courts where jamshyd gloried and drank deep and bahrám that great hunter the wild stamps his head but cannot break his sleep i sometimes think that never blows so the rose as where some buried cæsar bled that every hyacinth the garden dropt in her lap from some once lovely head and this reviving herb whose tender fledges the river lip on which we lean ah lean upon it lightly for who from what once lovely lip it springs unseen ah my belovèd fill the cup that to day of past regrets and future fears to morrow why to morrow i may myself with thousand years for some we loved the loveliest and the that from his vintage rolling time hath prest have drunk their cup a round or two before and one by one crept silently to rest and we that now make merry in the they left and summer dresses in new bloom ourselves must we beneath the couch of descend ourselves to make a couch for whom ah make the most of what we yet may spend before we too into the dust descend dust unto dust and under dust to lie sans wine sans song sans singer and sans end ah with the grape my fading life provide and wash my body whence the life has died and lay me shrouded in the living

were dried she could not look on the sweet heaven either at morn or eventide after the flitting of the bats when thickest dark did trance the sky she drew her casement curtain by and glanced athwart the glooming flats she only said night is dreary he cometh not she said she said am aweary aweary i would that i were dead upon the middle of the night waking she heard the night fowl crow the cock sung out an hour ere light from the dark fen the came to her without hope of change in sleep she to walk forlorn till cold winds woke the gray eyed about the lonely moated grange she only said day is dreary he cometh not she said she said am aweary aweary i would that i were dead about a stone cast from the a sluice with waters slept and it many round and small the marish mosses crept hard by a

would that i were dead and ever when the moon was low and the shrill winds were up and away in the white curtain to and fro she saw the gusty shadow sway but when the moon was very low and wild winds bound within their cell the shadow of the poplar upon her bed across her brow she only said night is dreary he cometh not she said she said am aweary aweary i would that i were dead all day within the dreamy house the doors upon their hinges the blue fly sung in the pane the behind the mouldering wainscot or from the crevice about old faces the doors old footsteps trod the upper floors old voices

the poplar made did all her sense but most she loathed the when the thick moted sunbeam athwart the chambers and the was sloping toward his western bower then said she am very dreary he will not come

runs to many camelot and up and down the people go gazing where the lilies round an island there below the island of shalott willows whiten aspens quiver little breezes dusk and the wave that runs for by the island in the flowing down to camelot four gray walls and four gray towers overlook a space of flowers and the silent isle the lady of shalott by the margin willow slide the heavy barges by slow horses and the shallop flitteth silken skimming down to camelot but who hath seen her wave her hand or at the casement seen her stand or is she known in all the land the lady of shalott only reapers reaping in among the bearded barley hear a song that echoes from the river winding clearly down to camelot and by the moon the reaper weary piling sheaves in uplands airy listening whispers the lady of shalott there she weaves by night and a magic web with colours gay she has heard a whisper say a curse is on her if she to look down to camelot she knows not what the curse may be and so she weaveth steadily and little other care hath she the lady of shalott and moving a mirror that hangs before her all the year shadows of the world appear there she sees the highway winding down to camelot there the river eddy whirls and there the surly village churls and the red cloaks of market girls pass onward from shalott sometimes a troop of damsels glad an abbot on an ambling pad sometimes a curly shepherd lad or long page in crimson clad goes by to camelot and sometimes the mirror the knights come riding two and two she hath no loyal knight and true the lady of shalott but in her web she still to weave the magic sights for often the silent a funeral with plumes and lights and music went to camelot or when the moon was overhead came two young lovers lately wed am half sick of shadows the lady of shalott a bow shot from her bower eaves he rode between the barley sheaves the sun came dazzling the leaves and flamed upon the brazen of bold sir lancelot a red cross knight for ever to a lady in his shield that sparkled on the yellow field beside remote shalott the gemmy bridle free like to some branch of stars we hung in the golden galaxy the bridle bells rang as he rode down to camelot and from his baldric a mighty silver bugle hung and as he rode his armour rung beside remote shalott all in the blue unclouded thick shone the saddle leather the helmet and the helmet like one burning flame together as he rode down to camelot as often the purple night below the starry clusters bright some bearded meteor trailing light moves over still shalott his broad clear brow in sunlight on hooves his war horse trode from underneath his helmet his coal black curls as on he rode as he rode down to camelot from the bank and from the he into the crystal mirror lirra by the sang sir lancelot she left the web she left the loom she made three paces the room she saw the water lily bloom she saw the helmet and the plume she down to camelot out flew the web and floated wide the mirror from side to side curse is come upon me the lady of shalott in the stormy east wind straining the pale yellow woods were waning the broad stream in his banks complaining heavily the low sky over camelot down she came and found a beneath a willow left afloat and round about the prow she the lady of shalott and down the dim expanse like some bold seer in a trance seeing all his own mischance with a glassy did she look to camelot and at the closing of the she loosed the chain and down she lay the broad stream bore her far away the lady of shalott lying robed in snowy that loosely flew to left and right the leaves upon her falling light the noises of the she floated down to camelot and as the boat head wound the willowy hills and fields among they heard her singing her last song the lady of shalott heard a carol mournful holy chanted loudly chanted lowly till her blood was frozen slowly and her eyes were darkened wholly to camelot for ere she upon the the first house by the water side singing in her song she died the lady of shalott under tower and balcony by garden wall and gallery a gleaming shape she floated by dead pale between the houses high silent into camelot out upon the wharfs they came knight and burgher lord and dame and round the prow they read her name the lady of shalott who is this and what is here and in the lighted palace died the sound of royal cheer and they themselves for fear all the knights at camelot but lancelot mused a little space he said has a lovely face god in his mercy lend her grace the lady of shalott 701 the daughter it is the daughter and she is grown so dear so dear that i would be the that trembles in her ear for hid in ringlets day and night touch her neck so warm and white and i would be the about her dainty dainty waist and her heart would beat against me in sorrow and in rest and i should know if it beat right clasp it round so close and tight and i would be the necklace and all day long to fall and upon her balmy bosom with her laughter or her sighs and i would lie so light so light i scarce should be at night 702 song of the lotos eaters there is sweet music here that softer than petals from blown roses on the grass or night dews on still waters between of shadowy granite in a gleaming pass music that gentlier on the spirit lies than tired eyelids upon tired eyes music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies here are cool mosses deep and the moss the ivies creep and in the stream the long leaved flowers weep and from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep why are we upon with heaviness and utterly consumed with sharp distress while all things else have rest from weariness all things have rest why should we toil alone we only toil who are the first of things and make perpetual moan still from one sorrow to another thrown nor ever fold our wings and cease from wanderings nor steep our brows in holy balm nor harken what the inner spirit sings is no joy but calm why should we only toil the roof and crown of things lo in the middle of the wood the folded leaf is from out the with winds upon the branch and grows green and broad and takes no care sun at noon and in the nightly dew fed and turning falls and floats adown the air lo with the summer light the full juiced apple waxing over mellow drops in a silent autumn night all its allotted length of days the flower ripens in its place ripens and fades and falls and hath no toil fast rooted in the fruitful soil hateful is the dark blue sky vaulted the dark blue sea death is the end of life ah should life all labour be let us alone time driveth onward fast and in a little while our lips are dumb let us alone what is it that will last all things are taken from us and portions and parcels of the dreadful past let us alone what pleasure can we to war with evil is there any in ever climbing up the climbing wave all things have rest and ripen toward the in silence ripen fall and cease give us long rest or death dark death or dreamful ease how sweet it were hearing the downward stream with half shut eyes ever to falling asleep in a half dream to dream and dream like yonder amber light which will not leave the myrrh bush on the height to hear each speech eating the lotos day by day to watch the crisping ripples on the beach and tender curving lines of creamy spray to lend our hearts and spirits to the influence of mild minded melancholy to muse and brood and live again in memory with those old faces of our over with a mound of grass two handfuls of white dust shut in an urn of brass dear is the memory of our wedded lives and dear the last embraces of our and their warm tears but all hath change for surely now our household hearths are cold our sons inherit us our looks are strange and we should come like ghosts to trouble joy or else the island princes over have eat our substance and the minstrel before them of the ten war in troy and our great deeds as half forgotten things is there confusion in the little isle let what is broken so remain the gods are hard to reconcile hard to settle order once again there is confusion worse than death trouble on trouble pain on pain long labour unto agèd breath sore task to hearts worn out with many and eyes grown dim with gazing on the pilot stars but propt on beds of amaranth and moly how sweet while warm airs lull us blowing lowly with half dropt eyelids still beneath a heaven dark and holy to watch the long bright river drawing his waters from the purple hill to hear the dewy echoes from cave to cave the thick twinèd vine to watch the emerald water many a acanthus wreath divine only to hear and see the far off sparkling brine only to hear were sweet out beneath the pine the lotos blooms below the barren peak the lotos blows by every winding creek all day the wind breathes low with mellower tone every hollow cave and alley round and round the spicy downs the yellow lotos dust is blown we have had enough of action and of motion we to starboard to larboard when the surge was seething free where the wallowing monster spouted his foam fountains in the sea let us swear an oath and keep it with an equal mind in the hollow lotos land to live and lie on the hills like gods together careless of mankind for they lie beside their nectar and the bolts are far below them in the valleys and the clouds are lightly round their golden houses girdled with the gleaming world where they smile in secret looking over wasted lands blight and famine plague and earthquake roaring deeps and fiery sands clanging fights and flaming towns and sinking ships and praying hands but they smile they find a music centred in a doleful steaming up a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong like a tale of little meaning the words are strong chanted from an ill used race of men that cleave the soil sow the seed and reap the harvest with enduring toil storing yearly little dues of wheat and wine and oil till they perish and they suffer some down in suffer endless anguish others in elysian valleys dwell resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel surely surely slumber is more sweet than toil the than labour in the deep mid ocean wind and wave and oar o rest ye brother mariners we will not wander more 703 st eve deep on the convent roof the are sparkling to the moon my breath to heaven like vapour goes may my soul follow soon the shadows of the convent slant down the snowy sward still creeping with the creeping that lead me to my lord make thou my spirit pure and as are the frosty skies or this first snowdrop of the that in my bosom lies as these white robes are and dark to yonder shining ground as this pale earthly spark to yonder argent round so shows my soul before the lamb my spirit before thee so in mine earthly house i am to that i hope to be break up the heavens o lord and far all yon starlight keen draw me thy bride a glittering star in raiment white and clean he lifts me to the golden doors the flashes come and go all heaven bursts her starry floors and strows her lights below and deepens on and up the roll back and far for me the heavenly bridegroom waits to make me pure of sin the sabbaths of eternity one sabbath deep and wide a light upon the shining sea the bridegroom with his bride 704 blow bugle blow the splendour falls on castle and snowy summits old in story the long light shakes across the lakes and the wild cataract leaps in glory blow bugle blow set the wild echoes flying blow bugle answer echoes dying dying dying o hark o hear how thin and clear and thinner clearer farther going o sweet and far from cliff and the horns of elfland faintly blowing blow let us hear the purple glens replying blow bugle answer echoes dying dying dying o love they die in yon rich sky they

now sleeps the crimson petal now the white nor waves the cypress in the palace walk nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font the firefly wakens waken thou with me now droops the milk white peacock like a ghost and like a ghost she glimmers on to me now lies the earth all danaë to the stars and all thy heart lies open unto me now slides the silent meteor on and a shining furrow as thy thoughts in me now folds the lily all her sweetness up and slips into the bosom of the lake so fold thyself my dearest thou and into my bosom and be lost in me 706 come down o maid come down o maid from yonder mountain height what pleasure lives in height the shepherd sang in height and cold the splendour of the hills but cease to move so near the heavens and to glide a sunbeam by the blasted pine to sit a star upon the sparkling spire and come for love is of the valley come for love is of the valley come thou and find him by the happy threshold he or hand in hand with plenty in the maize or red with spirted purple of the vats or foxlike in the vine nor cares to with death and morning on the silver horns nor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine nor find him dropt upon the firths of ice that huddling slant in furrow cloven to roll the torrent out of dusky doors but follow let the torrent dance thee to find him in the valley let the lean headed eagles yelp alone and the monstrous ledges there to slope and their thousand wreaths of dangling water smoke that like a broken purpose waste in air so waste not thou but come for all the await thee azure pillars of the arise to thee the children call and thy shepherd pipe and sweet is every sound sweeter thy voice but every sound is sweet myriads of rivulets hurrying the lawn the moan of doves in immemorial elms and murmuring of innumerable bees 707 from arthur henry hallam mdcccxxxiii fair ship that from the italian sailest the placid ocean with my lost loved remains spread thy full wings and waft him so draw him home to those that in vain a favourable ruffle thy mast and prosperous floods his holy urn all night no ruder air thy sliding keel till phosphor as our pure love early shall glimmer on the dewy decks sphere all your lights around above sleep gentle heavens before the prow sleep gentle winds as he sleeps now my friend the brother of my love my arthur whom i shall not till all my race be run dear as the mother to the son more than my brothers are to me i hear the noise about thy keel i hear the bell struck in the night i see the cabin window bright i see the sailor at the wheel thou the sailor to his wife and men from foreign lands and letters unto trembling hands and thy dark freight a life so bring him we have idle dreams this look of quiet flatters our home bred fancies o to us the fools of habit sweeter to rest beneath the clover sod that takes the sunshine and the rains or where the kneeling hamlet the chalice of the grapes of god than if with thee the roaring should gulf him fathom deep in brine and hands so often in mine should toss with tangle and with shells calm is the morn without a sound calm as to suit a calmer grief and only the faded the chestnut pattering to the ground calm and deep peace on this high wold and on these dews that drench the furze and all the silvery that twinkle into green and gold calm and still light on yon great that sweeps with all its autumn bowers and crowded farms and lessening towers to mingle with the bounding main calm and deep peace in this wide air these leaves that redden to the fall and in my heart if calm at all if any calm a calm despair calm on the seas and silver sleep and waves that sway themselves in rest and dead calm in that noble which heaves but with the heaving deep to night the winds begin to and roar from yonder dropping day the last red leaf is away the rooks are blown about the skies the forest the waters the cattle huddled on the lea and wildly on tower and the sunbeam strikes along the world and but for fancies which that all thy motions gently athwart a plane of molten glass i scarce could brook the strain and that makes the barren branches loud and but for fear it is not so the wild unrest that lives in would dote and pore on yonder that rises upward always higher and onward drags a labouring breast and topples round the dreary west a looming bastion fringed with fire thou comest much wept for such a thy canvas and my was as the whisper of an to breathe thee over lonely seas for i in spirit saw thee circles of the bounding sky week after week the days go by come quick thou bringest all i love henceforth wherever thou mayst my blessing like a line of light is on the waters day and night and like a beacon guards thee home so may whatever tempest mid ocean spare thee sacred bark and balmy drops in summer slide from the bosom of the stars so kind an office hath been done such precious relics brought by thee the dust of him i shall not till all my race be run now sometimes in my sorrow shut or breaking into song by fits alone alone to where he sits the shadow from head to foot who keeps the keys of all the creeds i wander often falling lame and looking back to whence i came or on to where the pathway leads and crying how changed from where it lands where not a leaf was dumb but all the lavish hills would the murmur of a happy pan when each by turns was guide to each and fancy light from fancy caught and thought leapt out to wed with ere thought could wed itself with speech and all we met was fair and good and all was good that time could bring and all the secret of the moved in the chambers of the blood and many an old on argive heights divinely sang and round us all the thicket to many a flute of arcady how fares it with the happy dead for here the man is more and more but he forgets the days god shut the doorways of his head the days have tone and tint and yet perhaps the hoarding gives out at times he knows not whence a little flash a mystic hint and in the long harmonious if death so taste lethean springs may some dim touch of earthly surprise thee ranging with thy peers if such a dreamy touch should fall o turn thee round resolve the doubt my guardian angel will speak in that high place and tell thee all the wish that of the living no life may fail beyond the grave derives it not from what we the likest god within the soul are god and nature then at strife that nature lends such evil dreams so careful of the type she seems so careless of the single life that i considering her secret meaning in her deeds and finding that of fifty she often brings but one to bear i falter where i firmly trod and falling with my weight of upon the great altar that slope darkness up to god i stretch lame hands of faith and grope and gather dust and chaff and to what i feel is lord of all and faintly trust the larger hope careful of the type but no from scarpèd cliff and quarried she cries thousand types are i care for nothing all shall go thou makest thine appeal to me i bring to life i bring to death the spirit does but mean the breath i know no more and he shall he man her last work who so fair such splendid purpose in his eyes who the psalm to wintry skies who built him fanes of fruitless prayer who trusted god was love and love final law nature red in tooth and with ravine against his creed who loved who countless ills who battled for the true the just be blown about the desert dust or within the iron hills no more a monster then a dream a discord dragons of the prime that tare each other in their slime were mellow music matched with him o life as futile then as frail o for thy voice to soothe and bless what hope of answer or redress behind the veil behind the veil the garden bough shall sway the tender blossom flutter down unloved that beech will gather brown this maple burn itself away unloved the sunflower shining fair ray round with flames her disk of seed and many a rose carnation with summer spice the humming air unloved by many a sandy bar the brook shall babble down the plain at noon or when the lesser is twisting round the polar star uncared for gird the windy grove and flood the haunts of hern and crake or into silver arrows the sailing moon in creek and cove till from the garden and the a fresh association blow and year by year the landscape familiar to the child as year by year the labourer his wonted glebe or lops the glades and year by year our memory from all the circle of the hills now fades the last long streak of snow now burgeons every maze of about the flowering squares and by ashen roots the violets blow now rings the woodland loud and long the distance takes a lovelier hue and in yonder living the lark becomes a sightless song now dance the lights on lawn and lea the flocks are whiter down the vale and milkier every milky on winding stream or distant sea where now the seamew pipes or in yonder greening gleam and the happy birds that change their to build and brood that live their from land to land and in my spring wakens too and my becomes an april violet and buds and blossoms like the rest love is and was my lord and king and in his presence i to hear the tidings of my friend which every hour his couriers bring love is and was my king and lord and will be as yet i within his court on earth and by his faithful guard and hear at times a who moves about from place to place and whispers to the worlds of space in the deep night that all is well 708 maud come into the garden maud for the black bat night has flown come into the garden maud i am here at the gate alone and the woodbine spices are wafted abroad and the musk of the roses blown for a breeze of morning moves and the planet of love is on high beginning to faint in the light that she on a bed of daffodil sky to faint in the light of the sun she loves to faint in his light and to die all night have the roses the flute violin bassoon all night has the casement jessamine to the dancers dancing in tune till a silence fell with the waking bird and a hush with the setting moon i said to the lily is but with whom she has heart to be gay when will the dancers leave her alone she is weary of dance and play now half to the setting moon are gone and half to the rising day low on the sand and loud on the the last wheel echoes away i said to the rose brief night in babble and revel and wine o young lord lover what sighs are for one that will never be thine but mine but mine so i sware to the rose ever and ever mine and the soul of the rose went into my blood as the music in the hall and long by the garden lake i stood for i heard your rivulet from the lake to the meadow and on to the wood our wood that is dearer than all from the meadow your walks have left so that whenever a march wind he sets the jewel print of your in violets blue as your eyes to the woody hollows in which we and the valleys of paradise the slender acacia would not one long milk bloom on the tree the white lake blossom fell into the lake as the pimpernel dozed on the lea but the rose was awake all night for your sake knowing your promise to me the lilies and roses were all awake they for the dawn and thee queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls come hither the dances are done in gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls queen lily and rose in one shine out little head sunning over with curls to the flowers and be their sun there has fallen a splendid from the passion flower at the gate she is coming my dove my dear she is coming my life my fate the red rose cries is near she is near and the white rose weeps is late the larkspur listens hear i hear and the lily whispers wait she is coming my own my sweet were it ever so airy a tread my heart would hear her and beat were it earth in an earthy bed my dust would hear her and beat had i lain for a century dead would start and tremble under her feet and blossom in purple and red 709 o that possible o that after long grief and to find the arms of my true round me once again a shadow flits before me not thou but like to thee ah christ that it were for one short hour to the souls we loved that they might tell what and where they be monckton milnes lord 710 shadows they to those who saw them meet the casual friends of every day her smile was and sweet his courtesy was free and gay but yet if one the in some unguarded moment heard the heart you thought so calm and would struggle like a captured bird and letters of mere formal were with repeated tears and this was not the work of days but had gone on for years and years alas that love was not too for maiden shame and manly pride alas that they so the goal of mutual bliss beside yet what no chance could then reveal and neither would be first to own let fate and courage now conceal when truth could bring remorse alone 711 the bride said the master unto the feast she heard the call and rose with willing feet but thinking it not otherwise than for such a bidding to put on her best she is gone from us for a few short into her bridal closet there to for the unfolding of the palace that gives her entrance to the blissful bowers we have not seen her yet though we have full often to her chamber door and have underneath the postern green and laid fresh flowers and short and soft but she hath made no answer and the from the clear west is fading fast away samuel 712 cean dubh deelish put your head darling darling darling your darling black head my heart above o mouth of honey with thyme for fragrance who with heart in breast could deny you love o

the trees where her misty vales expand and her forest paths in summer are by falling waters there is dew at high noontide there and springs the yellow sand on the fair hills of holy ireland he is and ringleted and plaited to the knee uileacan dubh o each captain who comes sailing across the irish sea uileacan dubh o and i will make my journey if life and health but stand unto that pleasant country

butter and the cream do wondrously abound uileacan dubh o the cresses on the water and the sorrels are at hand and the calling daily his note of music bland and the bold thrush sings so bravely his song the forests grand on the fair hills of holy ireland 715 song from heap cassia sandal buds and of labdanum and aloe balls with dull nard an indian from out her hair such balsam down sea side mountain pedestals from tree tops where tired winds are fain spent with the vast and howling main to treasure half their island gain and strew faint sweetness from some fine worm eaten which breaks to dust when once or shredded perfume like a from closet long to quiet with and dropping arras hung mouldering her lute and books among as when a queen long dead was young 716 the wanderers over the sea our galleys went with cleaving prows in order to a speeding wind and a bounding wave a gallant armament each bark built out of a forest left leafy and rough as first it grew and all over the gaping sides within and without with black bull hides seethed in fat and suppled in flame to bear the playful game so each good ship was rude to see rude and bare to the outward view but each upbore a stately where cedar pales in scented kept out the flakes of the dancing brine and an awning the mast below in fold on fold of the purple fine that neither noontide nor star nor moonlight cold which maketh mad might pierce the regal tenement when the sun o gay and we set the sail and plied the oar but when the night wind blew like breath for joy of one voyage more we sang together on the wide sea like men at peace on a peaceful shore each sail was loosed to the wind so free each helm made sure by the twilight star and in a sleep as calm as death we the voyagers from afar lay along each weary in a circle round its wondrous whence soft light and rich scent and with light and perfume music too so the stars round and the darkness past and at morn we started beside the mast and still each ship was sailing fast now one morn land a dim trembling betwixt sea and sky it cried our pilot the shout restrain the eager eye but the heaving sea was black for many a night and many a day and land though but a rock drew so we broke the cedar pales away let the purple awning flap in the wind and a statue bright was on every deck we shouted every man of us and right into the harbour thus with pomp and pæan glorious a hundred shapes of lucid stone all day we built its shrine for each a shrine of rock for every one nor paused till in the westering we sat together on the to sing because our task was done when lo what shouts and merry songs what laughter all the distance stirs a loaded raft with happy of gentle islanders isles are just at hand they cried cloudlets faint in even sleeping our temple gates are wide our olive groves thick shade are for these majestic they cried o then we awoke with sudden from our deep dream and knew too late how bare the rock how desolate which had received our precious freight yet we out our gifts once given must here abide our work is done we have no to mar our work we cried 717 thus the mayne glideth thus the mayne where my love abideth no softer it on through lawns on through meads on and on befall meandering and musical though the niggard bears not on its shaven aught but weeds and waving to view the river as it passes save here and there a scanty of primroses too faint to a weary bee and scarce it its gentle way through strangling where the glossy flutters when noon heats are near glad the shelving banks to shun red and steaming in the sun where the shrew mouse with pale burrows and the speckled stoat where the quick sandpipers in and out the marl and that seems to breed them brown as they naught disturbs its quiet way save some lazy stork that springs trailing it with legs and wings whom the shy fox from the rouses creep he so still 718 song the at the spring and at the morn at seven the hill dew the on the wing the on the thorn in his heaven right with the world 719 love me yet love me yet and i can your protracted growing june that bunch of flowers you carry from seeds of sowing i plant a heartful now some at least is sure to strike and yield what not pluck indeed not love but may be like look at least on remains a one violet your look that pays a thousand pains death love me yet 720 lover the rain set early in to night the sullen wind was soon awake it tore the elm tops down for spite and did its worst to vex the lake i with heart fit to break when glided in porphyria she shut the cold out and the storm and and made the cheerless blaze up and all the cottage warm which done she rose and from her withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl and laid her gloves by her hat and let the damp hair fall and last she sat down by my and me when no voice replied she put my arm about her waist and made her smooth white shoulder bare and all her yellow hair displaced and stooping made my cheek lie there and spread all her yellow hair murmuring how she loved me too weak for all her endeavour to set its struggling passion from pride and vainer ties dissever and give herself to me for ever but passion sometimes would prevail nor could to gay feast a sudden thought of one so for love of her and all in vain so she was come through wind and rain be sure i up at her happy and proud at last i porphyria me made my heart swell and still it while i debated what to do that moment she was mine mine fair perfectly pure and good i a thing to do and all her in one long yellow string i three times her little throat around and strangled her no pain felt she i am quite sure she felt no pain as a shut bud that holds a bee i warily oped her lids the blue eyes without a stain and i next the about her neck her cheek once bright beneath my burning kiss i her head up as before only this time my shoulder her head which droops upon it still the smiling rosy little head so glad it has its utmost will that all it at once is fled and i its love am instead love she not her darling one wish would be heard and thus we sit together now and all night long we have not and yet god has not said a word 721 song nay but you who do not love her is she not pure gold my mistress holds earth aught speak truth above her aught like this tress see and this tress and this last fairest tress of all so fair see ere i let it fall because you spend your lives in praising to praise you search the wide world over then why not witness calmly gazing if earth holds aught speak truth above her above this tress and this i but cannot praise i love so much 722 earl song a woman like a dewdrop so purer than the purest and her noble the noblest yes and her sure the surest and her eyes are dark and humid like the depth on depth of hid the harebell while her tresses sunnier than the wild grape cluster gush in golden tinted plenty down her rose misted marble then her music call it the bubbling the warble and this woman says days were sunless and my nights were moonless the pleasant april herbage and the outbreak tuneless if you loved me not and i who ah for words of flame adore her who am mad to lay my spirit prostrate palpably before her i may enter at her portal soon as now her lattice takes me and by noontide as by midnight make her mine as hers she makes me 723 in a gondola the kiss first kiss me as if you made me you were not sure this eve how my face your flower had its petals up so here and you brush it till i grow who wants me and wide ope i burst the kiss now kiss me as if you my heart at some noonday a bud that dares not the claim so all is up and passively its over your head to sleep i bow 724 meeting at night the gray sea and the long black land and the yellow half moon large and low and the startled little waves that in fiery ringlets from their sleep as i gain the cove with pushing prow and quench its speed the slushy sand then a mile of warm sea scented beach three fields to cross till a farm appears a tap at the pane the quick sharp and blue spurt of a lighted match and a voice less loud its joys and fears than the two hearts beating each to each 725 parting at morning round the cape of a sudden came the sea and the sun over the and straight was a path of gold for him and the need of a world of men for me 726 the lost mistress over then does truth sound as one at first believes hark the good night about your cottage eaves and the leaf buds on the vine are woolly i noticed that to day one day more bursts them open you know the red turns gray to morrow we meet the same then dearest may i take your hand in mine mere friends are we well friends the keep much that i resign for each glance of the eye so bright and black though i keep with endeavour your voice when you wish the snowdrops back though it stay in my soul for ever yet i will but say what mere friends say or only a thought stronger i will hold your hand but as long as all may or so very little longer 727 the last ride together i said then dearest since so since now at length my fate i know since nothing all my love avails since all my life meant for fails since this was written and needs must be my whole heart rises up to your name in pride and thankfulness take back the hope you gave i only a memory of the same and this beside if you will not blame your leave for one more last ride with me my mistress bent that brow of hers those deep dark eyes where pride when pity would be softening through me a breathing while or with life or death in the balance right the blood me again my last thought was at least not vain i and my mistress side by shall be together breathe and ride so one day more am i deified who knows but the world may end to night hush if you saw some western all billowy over by many benedictions and and evening at once and so you looking and loving best conscious grew your passion cloud sunset moonrise star shine too down on you near and yet more near till flesh must fade for heaven was here thus leant she and joy and fear thus lay she a moment on my breast then we began to ride my itself out a long freshening and fluttering in the wind past hopes already lay behind what need to strive with a life awry had i said that had i done this so might i gain so might i miss might she have loved me just as she might have hated who can tell where had i been now if the worst befell and here we are riding she and i fail i alone in words and deeds why all men strive and who succeeds we rode it my spirit flew saw other regions cities new as the world by on either side i thought all labour yet no bear up beneath their unsuccess look at the end of work the petty done the undone vast this present of theirs with the hopeful past i hoped she would love me here we ride what hand and brain went ever what heart alike conceived and dared what act proved all its thought had been what will but felt the fleshly screen we ride and i see her bosom heave many a crown for who can reach ten lines a life in each the flag stuck on a heap of bones a doing what atones they scratch his name on the abbey stones my riding is better by their leave what does it all mean poet well your brains beat into rhythm you what we felt only you you hold things beautiful the best and pace them in rhyme so side by side something nay much but then have you yourself best for men are you poor sick old ere your time nearer one whit your own than we who never have a rhyme sing a joy for me i ride and you great sculptor so you a score of years to art her slave and your venus whence we to yonder girl that fords the burn you acquiesce and shall i repine what man of music you grown with notes and nothing else to say is this your sole praise from a friend his strains intend but in music we know how fashions end i gave my youth but we ride in fine who knows fit for us had proposed bliss here should my being had i the bond still one must lead some life beyond have a bliss to die with dim descried this foot once planted on the goal this glory garland round my soul could i descry such try and test i sink back shuddering from the quest earth being so good would heaven seem best now heaven and she are beyond this ride and yet she has not spoke so long what if heaven be that fair and at best with our eyes whither flower is first we so ever should so abide what if we still ride on we with life for ever old yet new changed not in kind but in degree the instant made eternity and heaven just prove that i and ride ride together for ever ride 728 misconceptions this is a spray the bird clung to making it blossom with pleasure ere the high tree top she sprung to fit for her nest and her treasure o what a hope beyond was the poor which the flying feet hung to so to be singled out built in and sung to this is a heart the queen leant on in a minute erratic ere the true bosom she bent on meet for regal dalmatic o what a fancy was the poor ere the wanderer went on love to be saved for it to spent on 729 home thoughts from abroad o to be in now that there and whoever wakes in sees some morning unaware that the lowest boughs and the brushwood round the elm tree bole are in tiny leaf while the chaffinch sings on the orchard in england now and after april when may follows and the whitethroat builds and all the swallows hark where my pear tree in the leans to the field and scatters on the blossoms and dewdrops at the bent edge the wise thrush he sings each song twice over lest you should think he never could the first fine careless rapture and though the fields look rough with hoary dew all will be gay when noontide wakes the buttercups the little far brighter than this gaudy melon flower 730 home thoughts from the sea nobly nobly cape saint vincent to the north west died away sunset ran one glorious blood red reeking into cadiz bay bluish the burning water full in face trafalgar lay in the dimmest north east distance gibraltar grand and gray and here did

permission first his heavenly feet to lave then lay before him all thou hast no cloud of passion to usurp thy brow or mar thy hospitality no of mortal tumult to the marmoreal calmness grief should be like joy majestic equable sedate confirming cleansing raising making free strong to consume small troubles to great thoughts grave thoughts thoughts lasting to the end 734 the county of mayo the irish of thomas on the deck of patrick boat i sat in woful plight through my sighing all the weary day and weeping all the night were it not that full of sorrow from my people forth i go by the blessèd sun royally sing thy praise mayo when i dwelt at home in plenty and my gold did much abound in the company of fair young maids the spanish ale went round a bitter change from those gay days that now forced to and must leave my bones in santa cruz far from my own mayo they are girls in irrul now proud grown and high with their hair bags and their top knots for i pass their buckles by but little now i heed their airs for god will have it so that i must depart for foreign lands and leave my sweet mayo my grief that patrick loughlin is not earl of irrul still and that brian duff no longer rules as lord upon the hill and that colonel hugh mcgrady should be lying dead and low and i sailing sailing swiftly from the county of mayo 735 my grave the linnet in the rocky dells the moor lark in the air the bee among the heather that hide my lady fair the wild deer browse above her breast the wild birds raise their brood and they her smiles of love have left her solitude i ween that when the dark did first her form retain they thought their hearts could the light of joy again they thought the tide of grief would through future years but where is all their anguish now and where are all their tears well let them fight for breath or shade pursue the dweller in the land of is changed and careless too and if their eyes should watch and till source were dry she would not in her tranquil sleep return a single sigh blow west wind by the lonely mound and murmur summer streams there is no need of other to soothe my dreams 736 remembrance cold in the earth and the deep snow piled above thee far far removed cold in the dreary grave have i forgot my only love to love thee at last by all severing wave now when alone do my thoughts no longer over the mountains on that northern shore resting their wings where heath and fern leaves thy noble heart for ever ever more cold in the earth and fifteen wild from those brown hills have melted into spring faithful indeed is the spirit that after such years of change and suffering sweet love of youth forgive if i forget thee while the tide is bearing me along other desires and other hopes beset me hopes which obscure but cannot do thee wrong no later light has up my heaven no second morn has ever shone for me all my bliss from thy dear life was given all my bliss is in the grave with thee but when the days of golden dreams had and even despair was powerless to destroy then did i learn how existence could be and fed without the aid of joy then did i check the tears of useless passion my young soul from yearning after thine sternly denied its burning wish to down to that tomb already more than mine and even yet i dare not let it languish dare not indulge in rapturous pain once drinking deep of that divinest anguish how could i seek the empty world again 737 the prisoner still let my tyrants know i am not to year after year in gloom and desolate despair a messenger of hope comes every night to me and offers for short life eternal liberty he comes with western winds with wandering airs with that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars winds take a pensive tone and stars a tender fire and visions rise and change that kill me with desire desire for nothing known in my maturer years when joy grew mad with awe at counting future tears when if my sky was full of flashes warm i knew not whence they came from sun or thunder storm but first a hush of peace a soundless calm descends the struggle of distress and fierce impatience ends mute music soothes my breast that i could never dream till earth was lost to me then dawns the invisible the unseen its truth reveals my outward sense is gone my inward essence feels its wings are almost free its home its harbour found measuring the gulf it stoops and dares the final bound o dreadful is the check intense the agony when the ear begins to hear and the eye begins to see when the pulse begins to throb the brain to think again the soul to feel the flesh and the flesh to feel the chain yet i would lose no sting would wish no torture less the more that anguish racks the earlier it will bless and robed in fires of hell or bright with heavenly shine if it but herald death the vision is divine 738 last lines no coward soul is mine no trembler in the storm troubled sphere i see glories shine and faith shines equal arming me from fear o god within my breast almighty ever present deity life that in me has rest as i undying life have power in thee vain are the thousand that move hearts unutterably vain worthless as weeds or idlest froth amid the boundless main to waken doubt in holding so fast by thine infinity so surely the steadfast rock of immortality with wide embracing thy spirit animates eternal years pervades and broods above changes sustains dissolves creates and rears though earth and man were gone and suns and universes cease to be and thou were left alone every existence would exist in thee there is not room for death nor atom that his might could render void thou thou art being and breath and what thou art may never be destroyed 739 airly beacon airly beacon airly beacon o the pleasant sight to shires and towns from airly beacon while my love up to me airly beacon airly beacon o the happy hours we deep in fern on airly beacon courting through the day airly beacon airly beacon o the weary haunt for me all alone on airly beacon with his baby on my knee 740 the sands of dee mary go and call the cattle home and call the cattle home and call the cattle home across the sands of dee the western wind was wild and dark with foam and all alone went she the western tide crept up along the sand and and the sand and round and round the sand as far as eye could see the rolling mist came down and hid the land and never home came she is it weed or fish or floating hair a tress of golden hair a drownèd hair above the nets at sea was never salmon yet that shone so among the stakes of dee they her in across the rolling foam the cruel crawling foam the cruel hungry foam to her grave beside the sea but still the boatmen hear her call the cattle home across the sands of dee hugh 741 say not the struggle naught availeth say not the struggle naught availeth the labour and the wounds are vain the enemy faints not nor faileth and as things have been they remain if hopes were dupes fears may be liars it may be in yon smoke your comrades chase now the fliers and but for you possess the field for while the tired waves vainly breaking seem here no painful inch to gain far back through creeks and inlets making comes silent flooding in the main and not by eastern windows only when daylight comes comes in the light in front the sun climbs slow how slowly but westward look the land is bright 742 the imprisoned soul at the last tenderly from the walls of the powerful house from the clasp of the knitted locks from the keep of the well closed doors let me be wafted let me glide noiselessly forth with the key of softness unlock the locks with a set ope the doors o soul tenderly be not impatient strong is your hold o mortal flesh strong is your hold o love 743 o captain my captain o captain my captain our fearful trip is done the ship has every rack the prize we sought is won the port is near the bells i hear the people all exulting while follow eyes the steady keel the vessel grim and daring but o heart heart heart o the bleeding drops of red where on the deck my captain lies fallen cold and dead o captain my captain rise up and hear the bells rise up for you the flag is flung for you the bugle trills for you bouquets and wreaths for you the shores crowding for you they call the swaying mass their eager faces turning here captain dear father this arm beneath your head it is some dream that on the fallen cold and dead my captain does not answer his lips are pale and still my father does not feel my arm he has no pulse nor will the ship is safe and sound its voyage closed and done from fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won exult o shores and ring o bells but i with mournful tread walk the deck my captain lies fallen cold and dead 744 trust thou thy love trust thou thy love if she be proud is she not sweet trust thou thy love if she be mute is she not pure lay thou thy soul full in her hands low at her feet fail sun and breath yet for thy peace she shall endure 745 when the world is burning when the world is burning fired within yet round with face unscathed ere fierce flames uprushing all lands leap crushing till earth fall fire swathed up amidst the meadows gently through the shadows gentle flames will glide small and blue and golden though by bard beholden when in calm dreams folden calm his dreams will bide where the dance is sweeping through the greensward peeping shall the soft lights start laughing maids unstaying deeming it trick playing high their robes upswaying the lights shall dart and the woodland shall not cease to when far down some glade of the great burning one soft flame seems to his discerning crocus in the shade locker 746 at her window beating heart we come where my love reposes this is window pane these are roses is she nested does she in the twilight stilly lily clad from throat to heel she my virgin lily soon the wan the wistful stars fading will forsake her elves of light on beamy bars whisper then and wake her let this friendly pebble at her flowery grating if she hear me will she heed mabel i am waiting mabel will be anon zoned in apparel happy zone o hark to passion shaken carol sing thy song thou trancèd thrush pipe thy best thy clearest hush her lattice moves o hush dearest mabel dearest 747 the forsaken merman come dear children let us away down and away below now my brothers call from the bay now the great winds shoreward blow now the salt tides seaward flow now the wild white horses play champ and chafe and toss in the spray children dear let us away this way this way call her once before you go call once yet in a voice that she will know margaret voices should be call once more to a ear voices wild with pain surely she will come again call her once and come away this way this way dear we cannot stay the wild white horses foam and fret margaret margaret come dear children come away down call no more one last look at the white town and the little grey church on the windy shore then come down she will not come though you call all day come away come away children dear was it we heard the sweet bells over the bay in the caverns where we lay through the surf and through the swell the far off sound of a silver bell sand strewn caverns cool and deep where the winds are all asleep where the spent lights quiver and gleam where the salt weed sways in the stream where the sea beasts ranged all round feed in the ooze of their pasture ground where the sea snakes coil and twine dry their mail and bask in the brine where great whales come sailing by sail and sail with unshut eye round the world for ever and aye when did music come this way children dear was it yesterday children dear was it call yet once that she went away once she sate with you and me on a red gold throne in the heart of the sea and the youngest sate on her knee she its bright hair and she tended it well when down swung the sound of the far off bell she she up through the clear green sea she said must go for my kinsfolk in the little grey church on the shore to day be easter time in the world ah me and i lose my poor soul merman here with thee i said up dear heart through the waves say thy prayer and come back to the kind sea caves she smiled she went up through the surf in the bay children dear was it yesterday children dear were we long alone sea grows stormy the little ones moan long prayers i said the world they say come i said and we rose through the surf in the bay we went up the beach by the sandy where the sea stocks bloom to the white town through the narrow paved streets where all was still to the little grey church on the windy hill from the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers but we stood without in the cold blowing airs we on the graves on the stones worn with rains and we gazed up the aisle through the small leaded panes she sate by the pillar we saw her clear hist come quick we are here dear heart i said are long alone the sea grows stormy the little ones moan but ah she gave me never a look for her eyes were to the holy book loud prays the priest shut stands the door come away children call no more come away come down call no more down down down down to the depths of the sea she sits at her wheel in the humming town singing most joyfully hark what she sings joy o joy for the humming street and the child with its toy for the priest and the bell and the holy well for the wheel where i spun and the blessed light of the sun and so she sings her fill singing most joyfully till the shuttle falls from her hand and the whizzing wheel stands still she steals to the window and looks at the sand and over the sand at the sea and her eyes are set in a stare and anon there breaks a sigh and anon there drops a tear from a sorrow clouded eye and a heart sorrow laden a long long for the cold strange eyes of a little mermaiden and the gleam of her golden hair come away away children come children come down the hoarse wind blows colder lights shine in the town she will start from her when gusts shake the door she will hear the winds howling will hear the waves roar we shall see while above the waves roar and whirl a ceiling of amber a pavement of pearl singing came a mortal but faithless was she and alone dwell for the kings of the sea but children at midnight when soft the winds blow when clear falls the moonlight when spring tides are low when sweet airs come from heaths with broom and high rocks throw on the sands a gloom up the still glistening beaches up the creeks we will hie over banks of bright the ebb tide leaves dry we will gaze from the sand hills at the white sleeping town at the church on the hill side and then come back down singing dwells a loved one but cruel is she she left lonely for the kings of the sea 748 the song of callicles through the black rushing smoke bursts thick breaks the red flame all etna heaves her forest clothed frame not here o apollo are haunts meet for thee but where helicon breaks in cliff to the sea where the moon send far their light up the still vale of thisbe o speed and rejoice on the sward at the cliff top lie strewn the white flocks on the cliff side the roost deep in the rocks in the moonlight the shepherds soft by the rills lie wrapt in their blankets asleep on the hills what forms are these so white through the gloom what garments out the gold broom what sweet breathing out perfumes the thyme what voices the balmy prime apollo comes his choir the nine the leader is fairest but all are divine they are lost in the hollows they stream up again what seeks on this the glorified train they bathe on this mountain in the spring by their road then on to olympus their endless abode whose praise do they of what is it told what will be for ever what was from of old first hymn they the of all things and then the rest of immortals the action of men the day in his hotness the strife with the palm the night in her silence the stars in their calm 749 to marguerite yes in the sea of life enisled with echoing straits between us thrown dotting the shoreless watery wild we mortal millions live alone the islands feel the enclasping flow and then their endless bounds they know but when the moon their hollows lights and they are swept by balms of spring and in their glens on starry nights the nightingales divinely sing and lovely notes from shore to shore across the sounds and channels pour o then a longing like is to their farthest caverns sent for surely once they feel we parts of a single continent now round us spreads the watery plain o might our marges meet again who that their should be as soon as kindled who renders vain their deep desire a god a god their severance ruled and bade betwixt their shores to the salt estranging sea 750 requiescat strew on her roses roses and never a spray of yew in quiet she reposes ah would that i did too her mirth the world required she bathed it in smiles of glee but her heart was tired tired and now they let her be her life was turning turning in mazes of heat and sound but for peace her soul was yearning and now peace laps her round her ample spirit it and for breath to night it doth the vasty hall of death 751 the scholar gipsy go for they call you shepherd from the hill go shepherd and untie the wattled cotes no longer leave thy wistful flock unfed nor let thy bawling fellows rack their throats nor the grasses shoot another head but when the fields are still and the tired men and dogs all gone to rest and only the white sheep are sometimes cross and recross the strips of moon green come shepherd and again begin the quest here where the reaper was at work of late in this high dark corner where he his coat his basket and his earthen cruise and in the sun all morning binds the sheaves then here at noon comes back his stores to use here will i sit and wait while to my ear from uplands far the bleating of the folded flocks is borne with distant cries of reapers in the corn all the live murmur of a day is this nook the high half field and here till sundown shepherd will i be through the thick corn the scarlet poppies peep and round green roots and yellowing stalks i pale blue convolvulus in tendrils creep and air swept lindens their scent and rustle down their perfumed of bloom on the bent grass where i am laid and bower me from the august sun with shade and the eye travels down to towers and near me on the grass lies book come let me read the oft read tale again the story of that oxford scholar poor of pregnant parts and quick inventive brain who tired of knocking at door one summer morn his friends and went to learn the gipsy lore and the world with that wild brotherhood and came as most men to little good but came to oxford and his friends no more but once years after in the country lanes two scholars whom at college erst he knew met him and of his way of life inquired whereat he that the gipsy crew his mates had arts to rule as they the workings of brains and they can bind them to what thoughts they will i he said secret of their art when fully will to the world impart but it needs heaven sent moments for this skill this said he left them and no more but rumours hung about the country side that the lost scholar long was seen to stray seen by rare glimpses pensive and tongue tied in hat of antique shape and cloak of grey the same the gipsies wore shepherds had met him on the hurst in spring at some lone alehouse in the berkshire moors on the warm ingle bench the smock had found him seated at their entering but their drink and clatter he would fly and i myself seem half to know thy looks and put the shepherds wanderer on thy trace and boys who in lone wheatfields scare the i ask if thou hast their quiet place or in my boat i to the cool bank in the summer heats wide grass meadows which the sunshine fills and watch the warm green muffled cumnor hills and wonder if thou their shy retreats for most i know thou retirèd ground thee at the ferry oxford riders blithe returning home on summer nights have crossing the stripling thames at bablock hithe trailing in the cool stream thy fingers wet as the slow punt swings round and leaning backwards in a pensive dream and fostering in thy lap a heap of in shy fields and distant wychwood bowers and thine eyes resting on the moonlit stream and then they land and thou art seen no more maidens who from the distant hamlets to dance around the fyfield elm in may oft through the darkening fields have seen thee roam or cross a stile into the public way oft thou hast given them of flowers the frail white anemone dark bluebells with dews of summer eves and purple orchises with spotted leaves but none has words she can report of thee and above godstow bridge when hay in june and many a scythe in sunshine flames men who through those wide fields of breezy where black swallows haunt the glittering thames to bathe in the lasher pass have often thee sitting upon the river bank thine outlandish garb thy figure spare thy dark vague eyes and soft abstracted air but when they came from bathing thou wert gone at some lone homestead in the cumnor hills where at her open door the housewife darns thou hast been seen or hanging on a to watch the threshers in the mossy barns children who early range these slopes and for cresses from the rills have known thee watching all an april day the springing pastures and the feeding kine and thee when the stars come out and shine through the long dewy grass move slow away in autumn on the skirts of bagley wood where most the gipsies by the turf edged pitch their smoked tents and every bush you with scarlet patches and shreds of gray above the forest ground thessaly the blackbird picking sees thee nor stops his meal nor fears at all so often has he known thee past him rapt twirling in thy hand a spray and waiting for the spark from heaven to fall and once in winter on the causeway where home through flooded fields foot travellers go have i not thee on the wooden wrapt in thy cloak and battling with the snow thy face towards hinksey and its wintry ridge and thou hast the and the white brow of the cumnor range once to watch while thick the snowflakes fall the line of festal light in christ church hall then sought thy straw in some grange but what i dream two hundred years are since first thy story ran through oxford halls and the grave glanvil did the tale that thou wert from the studious to learn strange arts and join a gipsy tribe and thou from earth art long since and in some quiet churchyard laid some country nook where thy unknown tall grasses and white flowering nettles wave under a dark red fruited yew shade no no thou hast not felt the lapse of hours for what wears out the life of mortal men that from change to change their being rolls that repeated shocks again again exhaust the energy of strongest souls and numb the elastic powers till having used our nerves with bliss and teen and tired upon a thousand schemes our wit to the just pausing genius we our worn out life and are what we have been thou hast not lived why shouldst thou perish so thou hadst one aim one business one desire else wert thou long since with the dead else hadst thou spent like other men thy fire the generations of thy peers are fled and we ourselves shall go but thou possessest an immortal lot and we imagine thee exempt from and living as thou on page because thou hadst what we alas have not for early didst thou leave the world with fresh undiverted to the world without firm to their mark not spent on other things free from the sick fatigue the languid doubt which much to have tried in much been baffled brings o life unlike to ours who fluctuate idly without term or scope of whom each strives nor knows for what he strives and each half lives a hundred different lives who wait like thee but not like thee in hope thou waitest for the spark from heaven and we vague half believers of our casual creeds who never deeply felt nor clearly whose insight never has borne fruit in deeds whose weak resolves never have been for whom each year we breeds new beginnings disappointments new who hesitate and falter life away and lose to morrow the ground won to day ah do not we wanderer await it too yes we await it but it still delays and then we suffer and amongst us one who most has takes his seat upon the intellectual throne and all his store of sad experience lays bare of wretched days tells us his birth and growth and signs and how the dying spark of hope was fed and how the breast was soothed and how the head and all his hourly varied anodynes this for our wisest and we others pine and wish the long unhappy dream would end and waive all claim to bliss and try to bear with close patience for our only friend sad patience too near neighbour to despair but none has hope like thine thou through the fields and through the woods dost stray roaming the country side a truant boy nursing thy project in unclouded joy and every doubt long blown by time away o born in days when wits were fresh and clear and life ran gaily as the sparkling thames before this strange disease of modern life with its sick hurry its divided aims its heads its palsied hearts was rife fly hence our contact fear still fly plunge deeper in the bowering wood averse as dido did with gesture from her false approach in hades turn wave us away and keep thy solitude still nursing the unconquerable hope still clutching the inviolable shade with a free onward impulse brushing through by night the branches of the glade far on the forest skirts where none pursue on some mild pastoral emerge and resting on the moonlit pales freshen thy flowers as in former years with dew or listen with enchanted ears from the dark dingles to the nightingales but fly our paths our feverish contact fly for strong the infection of our mental strife which though it gives no bliss yet spoils for rest and we should win thee from thy own fair life like us distracted and like us unblest soon soon thy cheer would die thy hopes grow timorous and thy powers and thy clear aims be cross and shifting made and then thy glad perennial youth would fade fade and grow old at last and die like ours then fly our greetings fly our speech and smiles as some grave tyrian trader from the sea descried at sunrise an emerging lifting the cool creepers stealthily the fringes of a southward facing among the ægean isles and saw the merry grecian coaster come freighted with amber grapes and chian wine green bursting figs and tunnies in brine and knew the intruders on his ancient home the young light hearted masters of the waves and his rudder and shook out more sail and day and night held on the blue midland waters with the gale betwixt the syrtes and soft sicily to where the atlantic outside the western straits and unbent there where down cloudy cliffs through sheets of foam shy traffickers the dark iberians come and on the beach undid his corded bales 752 philomela hark ah the nightingale the tawny throated hark from that moonlit cedar what a burst what triumph hark what pain o wanderer from a grecian shore still after many years in distant lands still nourishing in thy that wild deep sunken old world pain say will it never heal and can this fragrant with its cool trees and night and the sweet tranquil thames and moonshine and the dew to thy heart and afford no balm dost thou to night here through the moonlight on this english grass the unfriendly palace in the thracian wild dost thou again with hot cheeks and the too clear web and thy dumb shame dost thou once more thy flight and feel come over thee poor fugitive the feathery once more and once more seem to make with love and hate triumph and agony lone daulis and the high cephissian vale listen eugenia how thick the bursts come crowding through the again thou hearest eternal passion eternal pain 753 shakespeare others abide our question thou art free we ask and ask thou smilest and art still out topping knowledge for the loftiest that to the stars uncrowns his majesty planting his steadfast footsteps in the sea making the heaven of heavens his dwelling place spares but the cloudy border of his to the searching of mortality and thou who didst the stars and sunbeams know self self self self secure didst walk on earth at better so all pains the immortal spirit must endure all weakness that impairs all griefs that bow find their sole voice in that victorious brow 754 from the hymn of empedocles is it so small a to have the sun to have lived light in the spring to have loved to have thought to have done to have advanced true friends and beat down baffling foes that we must feign a of doubtful future date and while we dream on lose all our present state and relegate to worlds yet distant our repose not much i know you what pleasures may be had who look on life with estranged like mine and sad and yet the village churl feels the truth more than you loth to leave this which to him little yields his hard sunburnt wife his often fields the boors with whom he the country spots he knew but thou because thou men scoff at heaven and fate because the gods thou fail to make blest thy state tremblest and wilt not dare to trust the joys there are i say fear not life leaves human effort scope but since life teems with ill nurse no extravagant hope because thou must not dream thou not then despair brighty 755 the flowers when love arose in heart and to wake the world to greater joy can she give me now said greed who thought to win some costly toy he rose he ran he he and soon the flowers that love let fall in hot grasp were and and greed said can this be all he flung them down and went his way he cared no jot for thyme or rose but boys and girls came out to play and some took these and some took those red blue and white and green and gold and at their touch the dew and all the bloom a thousandfold so red so ripe the roses 756 the thought into the skies one day i sent a little thought away up to where in the blue round the sun sat shining without sound then my thought came back to me little thought what did you in the regions whence you come and when i spoke my thought was dumb but she breathed of what was there in the pure bright upper air and because my thought so shone i knew she had been shone upon next by night a thought i up into the firmament when the eager stars were out and the still moon shone about and my thought went past the in between the stars but held her breath and durst not stir for the fear that covered her then she thought in this demur i look beneath the shade into where the worlds are made where the suns and stars are wrought shall i meet another thought that other thought have wings shall i meet strange heavenly things thought of thoughts and light of lights breath of breaths and night of nights then my thought began to in the illuminated dark till the silence over under made her heart beat more than thunder and my thought came trembling back but with something on her track and with something at her side nor till she has lived and died lived and died and lived again will that awful thing seem plain 757 maritæ suæ of all the flowers rising now thou only the of that drop of i placed beside thy bed in all the blooms that blow so fast thou hast no further part save those the hour i saw thee last i laid above thy heart two snowdrops for our boy and girl a primrose blown for me wreathed with one often with from each bright head for thee and so i graced thee for thy grave and made these tokens with that old silver heart i gave my first gift and my last i her babe upon her breast here she might lie and calmly her happy eyes on that far that backs the landscape fresh and still i hoped her thoughts would thrid the where careless birds on love carouse and gaze those apple blossoms to revel in the boundless blue but now her faculty of is elder sister to the light and travels free and through dense and rare through form and mind or else her life to be hath found new channels full and meet then o what eyes are leaning if fairer than they were before johnson 758 mimnermus in church you promise heavens free from strife pure truth and perfect change of will but sweet sweet is this human life so sweet i fain would breathe it still your chilly stars i can forgo this warm kind world is all i know you say there is no substance here one great reality above back from that void i shrink in fear and child like hide myself in love show me what angels feel till i cling a mere weak man to men you bid me lift my mean from faltering lips and fitful to sexless souls ideal quires unwearied voices wordless strains my mind with fonder welcome one dear dead tones forsooth the present we must to that which cannot pass away all beauteous things for which we by laws of time and space decay but o the very reason i clasp them is because they die 759 heraclitus they told me heraclitus they told me you were dead they brought me bitter news to hear and bitter tears to shed i wept as i how often you and had tired the sun with talking and sent him down the sky and now that thou art lying my dear old carian guest a handful of grey ashes long long ago at rest still are thy pleasant voices thy nightingales awake for death he taketh all away but them he cannot take 760 the married lover why having won her do i woo because her vestal provokes me always to pursue but spirit like eludes embrace because her womanhood is that as on court days subjects the hand yet so near a affirms no mean familiarness nay rather marks more fair the which can with safety so to dread as lower ladies might that grace could meet with disrespect thus she with happy favour allegiance from a love so that thence no false conceit of difference bridged or state put by because although in act and as lowly as a wife can be her manners when they call me lord remind me by courtesy not with her least consent of will which would my proud affection hurt but by the noble style that imputes an desert because her gay and lofty brows when all is won which hope can ask reflect a light of hopeless that bright in virgin ether bask because though free of the outer i am this temple keeps its sacred to heaven because in short not and never can be mine 761 if i were dead i were dead sometimes say poor child the dear lips as they spake and the tears from eyes which not to grieve me brightly smiled poor child poor child i seem to hear your laugh your talk your song it is not true that love will do no wrong poor child and did you think when you so cried and smiled how i in lonely nights should lie awake and of those words your full avengers make poor child poor child and now unless it that sweet amends thrice told are come to thee o god have thou no mercy upon me poor child 762 departure it was not like your great and gracious ways do you that have naught other to lament never my love of how that july afternoon you went with sudden unintelligible phrase and eye upon your journey of so many without a single kiss or a good bye i knew indeed that you were parting soon and so we sate within the low rays you whispering to me for your voice was weak your harrowing praise well it was to hear you such things speak and i could what made your eyes a growing gloom of love as a warm south wind sombres a march grove and it was like your great and gracious to turn your talk on daily things my dear lifting the luminous pathetic to let the laughter flash whilst i drew near because you spoke so low that i could scarcely hear but all at once to leave me at the last more at the wonder than the loss aghast with huddled unintelligible phrase and eye and go your journey of all with not one kiss or a good bye and the only loveless look the look with which you all unlike your great and gracious ways 763 the toys my little son who from thoughtful and moved and spoke in quiet grown up wise having my law the seventh time i struck him and with hard words and his mother who was patient being dead then fearing lest his grief should hinder sleep i visited his bed but found him slumbering deep with darkened eyelids and their lashes from his late sobbing wet and i with moan kissing away his tears left others of my own for on a table drawn beside his head he had put within his reach a box of counters and a red stone a piece of glass abraded by the beach and six or seven shells a bottle with bluebells and two french copper coins ranged there with careful art to comfort his sad heart so when that night i to god i wept and said ah when at last we lie with trancèd breath not vexing thee in death and thou rememberest of what we made our joys how weakly thy great commanded good then fatherly not than i whom thou hast moulded from the clay leave thy wrath and say will be sorry for their childishness 764 a farewell with all my will but much against my heart we two now part my very dear our solace is the sad road lies so clear it needs no art with faint averted and many a tear in our opposèd paths to persevere go thou to east i west we will not any hope it is so far away but o my best when the one darling of our widowhead the nursling grief is dead and no dews blur our to see the peach bloom come in evening skies perchance we may where now this night is day and even through faith of still averted feet making full circle of our banishment amazèd meet the bitter journey to the bourne so seasoning the termless feast of our with tears of recognition never dry 765 the ballad of keith of ravelston the murmur of the mourning that keeps the shadowy kine keith of ravelston the sorrows of thy line ravelston ravelston the merry path

chanted calendar first came the primrose on the bank high like a maiden looking from the window of a when the battle rolls below so she and saw the storms go by then came the wind in the valley left behind as a wounded maiden with purple streaks of woe when the battle has wanders to and fro so she dishevelled in the wind then came the daisies on the first of may like a while the crowd runs by the way with ten thousand flowers about them they came trooping through the fields as a happy people come so came they as a happy people when the war has away with dance and tabor pipe and drum and all make holiday then came the cowslip like a dancer in the fair she spread her little mat of green and on it danced she with a fillet bound about her brow a fillet round her happy brow a golden fillet round her brow and rubies in her hair 768 laus deo in the hall the coffin waits and the idle armourer stands at his belt the coffin nails and the hammer in his hands the bed of state is hung with crape the grand old bed where she was wed and like an upright corpse she sitteth gazing dumbly at the bed hour by hour her serving men enter by the door and with steps of muffled woe pass breathless

shall heal her ill but her watch she did not cease he her where she sat distraught and her holy cross the cross she from year to year but she neither saw nor heard and said he in her deaf all he had been wont to teach all she had been fond to hear prayer and solemn speech but she not a word only when he to speak with those who wept about the bed your lives she and cried is but newly dead then how sadly he from her it were wonderful to tell and he stood beside the death bed as by one who slumbers well and he him who lay there and in cautious whisper low is not dead but sleepeth said the priest and his brow said she looking up and the sun rose in her face must be better than i thought for the sleep is very sound is better said the priest and her maidens round with them came that ancient dame who nursed her when a child o nurse she nurse she cried nurse and then she smiled and then she wept with that they about her as of old her dying eyes were sweet and blue her trembling touch was cold but she said maidens true no more weeping and well away let them kill the feast i would be happy in my soul is better saith the priest he did but sleep the weary day and will waken whole carry me to his dear side and let the halls be trim whistly whistly said she am wan with watching and wail he must not wake to see me pale let me sleep with him see you keep the tryst for me i would rest till he

need yea every bygone prayer gabriel 771 the blessèd damozel the blessèd damozel from the gold bar of heaven her blue grave eyes were deeper than a deep water even she had three lilies in her hand and the stars in her hair were seven her robe ungirt from clasp to hem no wrought flowers did adorn but a white rose of on the neck meetly worn and her hair lying down her back was yellow like ripe corn she scarce had been a one of choristers the wonder was not yet quite from that still look of hers albeit to them she left her had counted as ten years to one it is ten years of years yet now here in this place surely she me her fell all about my face nothing the autumn fall of leaves the whole year sets apace it was the terrace of that she was standing on by god built over the sheer in which space is begun so high that looking downward thence she scarce could see the sun it lies from heaven across the of ether as a bridge beneath the tides of day and with flame and darkness the void as low as where this spins like a fretful midge but in those tracts with her it the peace of utter and silence for no breeze may along the steady of seraphim no echo there beyond all depth or height heard hardly some of her new friends playing at holy games spake gentle among themselves their virginal chaste names and the souls mounting up to god went by her like thin flames and still she herself and into the vast waste calm till her pressure must have the bar she on warm and the lilies lay as if along her bended arm from the fixt lull of heaven she time like a pulse shake through all the worlds her gaze still strove in that steep gulf to the swarm and then she spoke as the stars sang in their spheres wish that he were come to me for he will come she said i not in solemn heaven on earth has he not are not two prayers a perfect strength and shall i feel afraid round his head the aureole clings and he is clothed in white take his hand and go with to the deep wells of light and we will step down as to a and bathe there in sight two will stand beside that shrine occult withheld untrod whose lamps tremble with prayer sent up to god and where each need its patient period two will lie the shadow that living mystic within whose secret growth the sometimes is felt to be while every leaf that his plumes saith his name audibly i myself will teach to him i myself lying so the songs i sing here which his shall pause in and slow finding some knowledge at each pause and some new thing to know alas to her wise simple these things were all but before they trembled on her sense her voice had caught their tone alas for lonely heaven for life wrung out alone alas and though the end were was thy part or borne in trust and for her shall this too be found good may the close lips that knew not praise ever though they would two she said seek the where the lady mary is with her five handmaidens whose are five sweet symphonies cecily gertrude magdalen margaret and rosalys wise sit they with bound and bosoms coverèd into the fine cloth white like flame weaving the golden thread to fashion the birth robes for who are just born being dead shall fear haply and be dumb then i will lay my to his and tell about our love not once or weak and the dear mother will my pride and let me speak shall bring us hand in hand to him round whom all kneel the solemn with their aureoles and angels meeting us shall to their citherns and citoles will i ask of christ the thus much for him and me to have more blessing than on in nowise but to as then we were being as at peace yea verily verily when he is we will do thus and thus till this my vigil seem quite and almost fabulous we two will live at once one life and peace shall be with us she gazed and and then said less sad of speech than mild this is when he comes she ceased the light past her with angels in strong level lapse her eyes and she smiled i saw her smile but soon their was vague the poised spheres and then she cast her arms the golden barriers and laid her face between her hands and wept i heard her tears 772 love in the valley under yonder beech tree single on the green sward with her arms behind her golden head knees and tresses folded to slip and ripple idly lies my young love sleeping in the shade had i the heart to slide an arm beneath her press her parting lips as her waist i gather slow waking in amazement she could not but embrace me then would she hold me and never let me go shy as the squirrel and wayward as the swallow swift as the swallow along the circleting the surface to meet his winglets fleeter she seems in her stay than in her flight shy as the squirrel that leaps among the pine tops wayward as the swallow overhead at set of sun she whom i love is hard to catch and conquer hard but o the glory of the winning were she won when her mother tends her before the laughing mirror tying up her laces looping up her hair often she thinks were this wild thing wedded more love should i have and much less care when her mother tends her before the lighted mirror loosening her laces combing down her curls often she thinks were this wild thing wedded i should miss but one for many boys and girls heartless she is as the shadow in the flying to the hills on a blue and breezy noon no she is athirst and drinking up her wonder earth to her is young as the slip of the new moon deals she an unkindness but her rapid measure even as in a dance and her smile can heal no less like the swinging may cloud that pelts the flowers with off a sunny border she was made to bruise and bless lovely are the curves of the white owl wavy in the dusk lit by one large star lone on the fir branch his rattle note unvaried brooding the gloom spins the brown evejar darker grows the valley more and more forgetting so were it with me if forgetting could be tell the grassy hollow that holds the bubbling well spring tell it to forget the source that keeps it stepping down the hill with her fair companions arm in arm all against the raying west boldly she sings to the merry tune she marches brave is her shape and sweeter sweeter for she is what my heart first the world was morning light is she love that so desires would fain keep her changeless fain would fling the net and fain have her free happy happy time when the white star low over dim fields fresh with bloomy dew near the face of dawn that draws athwart the darkness threading it with colour like yewberries the yew thicker crowd the shades as the grave east glowing and with crimson a long cloud swells maiden still the morn is and strange she is and secret strange her eyes her cheeks are cold as cold sea shells sunrays leaning on our southern hills and wild cloud mountains that drag the hills along oft ends the day of your shifting brilliant chill as a dull face frowning on a song ay but shows the south west a ripple blown to silver while the clouds are shaken and scaling the mid heavens as they stream there comes a rich deep like love in beauty without end when at dawn she sighs and like an infant to the turns grave eyes craving light released from dreams beautiful she looks like a white water bursting out of bud in havens of the streams when from bed she rises clothed from neck to in her long nightgown sweet as boughs of may beautiful she looks like a tall garden pure from the night and splendid for the day mother of the dews dark eye twilight low lidded twilight the brim rounding on thy breast sings the dew delighted skylark clear as though the dewdrops had their voice in him hidden where the rose flush drinks the rayless planet fountain full he pours the spraying fountain showers let me hear her laughter i would have her cool as dew in twilight the lark above the flowers all the girls are out with their baskets for the primrose up lanes woods through they troop in joyful bands my sweet leads she knows not why but now she loiters eyes the bent anemones and hangs her hands such a look will tell that the violets are peeping coming the rose and unaware a springs in her bosom for odours and for colour covert and the nightingale she knows not why head and chin she darts between her tulips streaming like a willow gray in arrowy rain some bend beaten cheek to gravel and their she will be she lifts them and on she speeds again black the driving raincloud breasts the iron gateway she is forth to cheer a neighbour lacking mirth so when sky and grass met rolling dumb for saw i once a white dove sole light of earth prim little scholars are the flowers of her garden to stand in rows and asking if they please i might love them well but for loving more the wild ones o my wild ones they tell me more than these you my wild one you tell of honied field rose violet blushing eglantine in life and even as they they by the wayside are earnest of your goodness you are of on the banks that line the way peering at her chamber the white crowns the red rose jasmine winds the porch with stars two and three parted is the window she sleeps the starry breathes a falling breath that carries thoughts of me sweeter unpossessed have i said of her my sweetest not while she sleeps while she sleeps the jasmine breathes luring her to love she sleeps the starry bears me to her pillow under white rose wreaths yellow with birdfoot trefoil are the grass glades yellow with cinquefoil of the dew gray leaf yellow with stonecrop the moss mounds are yellow blue the wheat sways yellowing to the sheaf green yellow bursts from the copse the laughing yaffle sharp as a sickle is the edge of shade and shine earth in her heart laughs looking at the heavens thinking of the harvest i look and think of mine this i may know her dressing and such a change of light shows as when the skies in shift from cloud to moonlight or edging over slips a ray of sun or sweeping into white sails furl or on the ocean white sails lean along the waves leaping green visions of her shower before me but from guarded she would be like the sun were she seen front door and back of the old open with the morn and in a breezy freshly sparkles garden to stripe orchard green across a rill where on sand the minnows wink busy in the grass the early sun of swarms and the mellow fluting call my darling up with round and roguish challenge quaintest richest carol of all the singing throats cool was the woodside cool as her white keeping sweet the cream pan and there the boys from school cricketing below brown and red with sunshine o the dark translucence of the deep eyed cool spying from the farm herself she a full of milk and tilted for each in turn the beak then a little fellow mouth up and on tiptoe said will kiss she and her cheek doves of the fir wood walling high our red through the long noon coo crooning through the coo loose droop the leaves and down the sleepy sometimes pipes a chaffinch loose droops the blue cows flap a slow tail knee deep in the river breathless given up to sun and gnat and fly nowhere is she seen and if i see her nowhere lightning may come straight rains and tiger sky o the golden sheaf the rustling treasure armful o the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced o the treasure tresses one another nodding o the girdle slack about the waist slain are the poppies that shot their random quick amid the wheat ears wound about the waist gathered see these brides of earth one blush of ripeness o the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced large and smoky red the cold disk drops clipped by naked hills on violet shaded snow eastward large and still lights up a bower of moonrise whence at her leisure steps the moon aglow nightlong on black print branches our beech gazes in this whiteness nightlong could i here may life on death or death on life be painted let me clasp her soul to know she cannot die gossips count her faults they scour a narrow where there is no window read not heaven or her she was a tiny one agèd woman quavers plucks at my heart and leads me by the ear faults she had once as she to run and tumbled faults of feature some see beauty not complete yet good gossips beauty that makes earth and air may have faults from head to feet hither she comes she comes to me she lingers deepens her brown eyebrows while in new high rise the lashes in wonder of a stranger yet am i the light and living of her eyes something friends have told her fills her heart to brimming nets her in her blushes and wounds her and tames sure of her haven o like a dove alighting arms up she our souls were in our names soon will she lie like a white frost sunrise yellow oats and brown wheat barley pale as rye long since your sheaves have yielded to the thresher felt the girdle seen the tresses fly soon will she lie like a blood red sunset swift with the to morrow green spring sing from the south west bring her back the truants nightingale and swallow song and dipping wing soft new beech leaves up to beamy spreading bough on bough a primrose mountain lucid in the moon raise lilies to the skyfields youngest green transfused in silver shining through fairer than the lily than the wild white cherry fair as in image my seraph love borne to me by dreams when dawn is at my eyelids fair as in the flesh she swims to me on tears could i find a place to be alone with heaven i would speak my heart out heaven is my need every woodland tree is flushing like the dogwood flashing like the whitebeam swaying like the reed flushing like the dogwood crimson in october streaming like the flag reed south west blown flashing as in gusts the sudden lighted whitebeam all seem to know what is for heaven alone 773 phœbus with admetus when by zeus relenting the mandate was revoked sentencing to exile the bright sun god mindful were the ploughmen of who the steer had yoked who

hurried flight and drops the stir in memory seem these things which out of turf and clay astrain for light push patient rings or leap to find the waterway equal to a wonder done whatever simple lives their tricks beneath the father sun as though they caught a broken clue so hard was earth an eyewink back but now the common life has come the blotting cloud a dappled pack the grasses one vast underhum a city clothed in snow and soot with lamps for day in ghostly rows breaks to the scene of hosts afoot the river that reflective flows and there did fog down crypts of play spectre upon eye and mouth their faces are a glass to this magic of the whirl for south a burly joy each creature with sound of its own hungry quest earth has to fill her empty wells and speed the service of the nest the phantom of the snow wreath melt that haunts the look abroad who sees what tomb a white night built where flocks now bleat and sprouts the clod for iron winter held her firm across her sky he laid his hand and bird he starved he worm a sightless heaven a shaven land her shivering spring fast asleep the bitten buds dared not unfold we raced on roads and ice to thought of the girl we love from cold but now the north wind ceases the warm south west awakes the heavens are out in fleeces and green banner shakes 775 grave mark where the pressing wind shoots javelin like its skeleton shadow on the broad wave here is a fitting spot to dig grave here where the ponderous breakers plunge and strike and dart their hissing tongues high up the sand in hearing of the ocean and in of those wind streaks running into white if i the death of love had deeply i never could have made it half so sure as by the unblest kisses which the full waked sense or failing that degrade morning but no morning

sunny braes down to the central fires exist alike in love love is a filling all the abysses of lornest space in whose deeps suns and their bright broods swim this mighty sea of love with wondrous tides is sternly just to sun and grain laving at this moment sides in my blood and brain all things have something more than barren use there is a scent upon the brier a tremulous splendour in the autumn dews cold morns are fringed with fire the clodded earth goes up in sweet flowers in music dies poor human speech and into beauty blow those hearts of when love is born in each daisies are white upon the churchyard sod sweet tears the clouds lean down and give the world is very lovely o my god i thank thee that i live 778 barbara on the sabbath day through the churchyard old and gray over the crisp and yellow leaves i held my rustling way and amid the words of mercy falling on my soul like balms the gorgeous storms of music in the mellow organ calms the upward streaming prayers and the rich and solemn psalms i stood careless barbara my heart was otherwhere while the organ shook the air and the priest with outspread hands the people with a prayer but when rising to go homeward with a mild and saint like a face of airy beauty with its heavenly eyes on mine and in a moment o that face was surely out of heaven barbara o pallid pallid face o earnest eyes of grace when last i saw thee dearest it was in another place you came running forth to meet me with my love gift on your wrist the flutter of a long white dress then all was lost in mist a purple stain of agony was on the mouth i that wild morning barbara i searched in my despair sunny noon and midnight air i could not drive away the thought that you were lingering there o many and many a winter night i sat when you were gone my worn face buried in my hands beside the fire alone within the dripping churchyard the rain plashing on your stone you were sleeping barbara angels do you of the precious golden i around your happy arm while sitting by yon brink or when that night of gliding dance of laughter and guitars was emptied of its music and we through lattice bars the silent midnight heaven creeping us with its stars till the day broke barbara in the years changed wild and far my heart has ranged and many sins and errors now have been on me avenged but to you i have been faithful whatsoever good i i loved you and above my life still hangs that love intact your love the trembling rainbow i the reckless cataract still i love you barbara yet love i am unblest with many doubts opprest i wander like the desert wind without a place of rest could i but win you for an hour from off that starry shore the hunger of my soul were for death hath told you than the melancholy world doth know things deeper than all you could teach me barbara in vain in vain in vain you will never come again there droops upon the dreary hills a mournful fringe of rain the gloaming closes slowly round loud winds are in the tree round selfish shores for ever moans the hurt and wounded sea there is no rest upon the earth peace is with death and thee barbara georgina 779 bride song too late for love too late for joy too late too late

leave us on a lonely shore sweet are familiar songs music her hollow shell in forlornest wells and sweet sad the sound of midnight when the oped casement with the night rain drips there is a pleasure which is born of pain the grave of all things hath its violet else why days which never come again roams hope with that strange longing like regret why put the posy in the cold dead hand why plant the rose above the lonely grave why bring the corpse across the salt sea wave why deem the dead more near in native land thy name hath been a silence in my so long it falters upon language now o more to me than sister or than wife once and now nothing it is hard to that such things have been and are not and life loiters keeps a pulse at even measure and goes upon its business and its pleasure and

in its beginning ah forgotten stumble back strangely and the ghost of stands by fire cold cold and the last spark out how could i sing with those old airs haunting me all the and those old steps that sound when daylight shuts for back she comes and moves reproachfully the mistress of my moods and looks cruel to the last as i not she that did the wrong and broke the spell and memory comfortless away away phantoms about whose brows the bindweed clings hopeless regret in thinking of these some men have lost their minds and others may yet o for one deep draught in this dull hour one deep deep draught of the departed time o for one brief strong pulse of ancient power to beat and breathe all the valves of rhyme thou memory with thy downward eyes that the cup bearer of gods pour deep and long brim all the vacant chalices of with health droop down thine urn i hold my one draught of what i shall not taste save when my brain with thy dark wine is one draught and then straight onward spite of pain and spite of all things changed with gaze footsteps the waning past to undaunted and to carve in the wan of last outposts on utmost height the sad resemblance of an hour or more midnight and love and youth and italy love in the land where love most lovely seems land of my love i be far from thee lend for sake the light of thy moonbeams the spirit of thy cypress groves and thy dark eyed beauty for a little to my desire yet once more let her fall me me let her long hair fall under the blessèd darkness we were alone in that best hour of which first to us how much we loved the thick starlight the young night hung trembling us at her feet i knelt and gazed up from her feet into her eyes her face was we breathed each sighs we did not speak not move we we felt the night said not a word the breeze was dead the leaf lay without whispering on the tree as i lay at her feet was her head one hand in mine and one still went wandering through my hair we were together how where what matter somewhere in a dream drifting slow drifting down a wizard stream whither together then what matter whither it was enough for me to clasp her hand to blend with her love looks my own no more enough with thoughts like ships that cannot land blown by faint winds about a magic shore to realize in each mysterious feeling the droop of the warm cheek so near my own the cool white arm about my shoulder thrown those exquisite fair feet where i was kneeling how little know they divinest bliss that know not to possess and yet refrain let the young psyche roam a fleeting kiss grasp it a few poor grains of dust remain see how those floating flowers the butterflies hover the garden and take no root desire for ever hath a flying foot free pleasure comes and goes beneath the skies close not thy hand upon the innocent that trusts itself within thy reach it may or may not linger thou canst but the wingèd wanderer let it go or stay love thou the rose yet leave it on its stem think midas starved by turning all to gold blessèd are those that spare and that withhold because the whole world shall be trusted them the foolish faun pursues the unwilling that culls her flowers beside the or dips her

be changed for evermore chase not too close the fading rapture to love his long auroras slowly seen be ready to release as to receive deem those the nearest soul to soul whose lips yet lingers

watch stars in outer air and what by fits made hot oleanders in a rosy searched by the lamping fly whose little went in and out like bashful hope meanwhile the sleepy globe began to a ponderous shoulder sunward the dark and the night in beauty like a dream aloof in those dark heavens paused destiny with her last star descending in the of the cold morrow from the emptied sky the hour the distance from her old self the novelty and loneness of the had left a lovely awe on that fair face and all the land grew strange and magical as droops some billowy cloud to the hill heavy with all tears for all care she unto me without force or will and sank upon my bosom murmuring a inarticulate passionate words o moment of all moments upon earth o supreme how worth how wildly worth whole worlds of flame to know this world affords what even eternity can not restore when all the ends of life take hands and round centres of sweet fire ah never more ah never shall the bitter with the be mingled so in the pale after years one hour of life immortal spirits possess this drains the world and leaves but weariness and parching passion and perplexing tears sad is it that we cannot even that hour to sweeten last toil but grasps all and leaves us and when we would weep we dare not let our tears fall lest in truth they fall upon our work which must be done and so we bind up our torn hearts from breaking our eyes from weeping and our brows from aching and follow the long pathway all alone 795 the last wish since all that i can ever do for is to do nothing this my prayer must be that thou mayst never guess nor ever the all endured this nothing done costs me 796 in the train as we rush as we rush in the train the trees and the houses go wheeling back but the starry heavens above the come flying on our track all the beautiful stars of the sky the silver doves of the forest of night over the dull earth swarm and fly companions of our flight we will rush ever on without fear let the goal be far the flight be fleet for we carry the heavens with us dear while the earth slips from our feet 797 sunday up the river my love the water bends dreaming it glideth and glideth away she sees there her own beauty through shadow and ripple and spray o tell her thou murmuring river as past her your light wavelets roll how steadfast that image for shines pure in pure depths of my soul 798

read and his home is bright with a calm delight though the room be poor indeed give a man a girl he can love as i o my love love thee and his heart is great with the pulse of fate at home on land on

reeleth with his own heart that great rich vine 800 summer dawn pray but one prayer for me thy closed lips think but one thought of me up in the stars the summer night waneth the morning light faint and gray the leaves of the aspen betwixt the cloud bars that are patiently waiting there for the dawn patient and colourless though waits to float through them along with the sun far out in the meadows above the young corn the heavy elms wait and restless and the uneasy wind rises the roses are dun through the long twilight they pray for the round the lone house in the midst of the corn speak but one word to me over the corn over the tender locks of the corn 801 love is enough love is enough though the world be a waning and the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining though the sky be too dark for dim eyes to the gold cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder though the hills be held shadows and the sea a dark wonder and this day draw a veil over all deeds over yet their hands shall not tremble their feet shall not falter the void shall not weary the fear shall not these lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover 802 the song to hylas i know a little garden set thick with lily and red rose where i would wander if i from dewy dawn to dewy night and have one with me wandering and though within it no birds sing and though no house is there and though the apple boughs are of fruit and blossom would to god her feet upon the green grass trod and i beheld them as before there comes a murmur from the shore and in the place two fair streams are drawn from the purple hills afar drawn down unto the restless sea the hills whose flowers fed the bee the shore no ship has ever seen still beaten by the billows green whose murmur comes unto the place for which i cry for which i cry both day and night for which i let slip all delight that maketh me both deaf and blind careless to win to find and quick to lose what all men seek yet tottering as i am and weak still have i left a little to seek within the jaws of an entrance to that happy place to seek the unforgotten once seen once once reft from anigh the murmuring of the sea berkeley wriothesley 803 the water nymph and the boy i flung me round him i drew him under i clung i him my own white wonder father and mother weeping and wild came to the forest calling the child came from the palace down to the pool calling my darling my beautiful under the water cold and so pale could it be love beauty to fail ah me for mortals in a few moons if i had left him after some he would have faded faded away he the young monarch all would obey fairer than day alien to springtime joyless and gray he would have faded faded away moving a mockery of the day now i have taken all in his prime saved from slow pitiless time with his happiness one with the prime saved from the dishonour of time laid him my beautiful laid him to rest loving adorable softly to rest here in my crystalline here in my breast 804 the old they are waiting on the for the bark to take them home they will toil and grieve no more the hour for release hath come all their long life lies like a dimly blending dream there is nothing left to to the realms that only seem they are waiting for the boat there is nothing left to do what was near them grows remote happy silence falls like dew now the shadowy bark is come and the weary may go home by still water they would in the shadow of the tree after battle sleep is best after noise tranquillity 805 meet we no angels pansie came on a sabbath noon my sweet in white to find her

and the fallen cling to her and the southwest wind and the west wind sing for rains and ruins are over and all the season of snows and sins the days dividing lover and lover the light that loses the night that wins and time is grief forgotten and frosts are slain and flowers begotten and in green underwood and blossom by blossom the spring begins the full streams feed on flower of rushes ripe grasses trammel a travelling foot the faint fresh flame of the young year from leaf to flower and flower to fruit and fruit and leaf are as gold and fire and the oat is heard above the lyre and the

his feet set to through the boughs overhead and my foliage rings round him and rustles and branches are bent with his tread the storm winds of blow through me and cease the war wind that rages the spring wind of peace ere the breath of them roughen my tresses ere one of my blossoms increase all sounds of all changes all shadows and on the mountain and stream riven heights whose tongue is the tongue and language of storm clouds on earth shaking nights all forms of all faces all works of all in unsearchable of time stricken lands all death and all life and all reigns and all ruins drop

centuries of days strong blossoms with perfume of manhood shot out from my spirit as rays and the sound of them and smell of their were as warmth and sweet and strength to my roots and the lives of my children made perfect with freedom of soul were my fruits i bid you but be i have need not of prayer i have need of you as your mouths of mine air that my heart may be greater within me beholding the fruits of me fair more fair than strange fruit of faiths ye espouse in me only the root that blooms in your boughs behold now your god that ye made you to feed him with faith of your vows in the darkening and abysses adored with dayspring and for lamp and for sword god thunders in heaven and his angels are red with the wrath of the lord o my sons o too toward gods not of me was not i enough beautiful was it hard to be free for behold i am with you am in you and of you look forth now and see lo with wonders with miracles shod with the fires of his for raiment and rod god trembles in

brother on this that was the veil of thee or quiet sea flower moulded by the sea or simplest growth of meadow sweet or sorrel such as the summer sleepy dryads weave waked up by snow soft sudden rains at eve or wilt thou rather as on earth before half faded fiery blossoms pale with and full of bitter summer but more to thee than gleanings of a northern trod by no tropic feet for always thee the fervid languid allured of heavier suns in mightier skies thine ears knew all the wandering watery where the sea sobs round lesbian promontories the barren kiss of piteous wave to that knows not where is that leucadian which hides too deep the supreme head of song ah salt and sterile as her kisses were the wild sea winds her and the green gulfs hither and thither and vex and work her wrong blind gods that cannot spare thou sawest in thine old singing season brother secrets and sorrows unbeheld of us fierce loves and lovely leaf buds poisonous bare to thy subtler eye but for none blowing by night in some unbreathed in clime the hidden harvest of luxurious time sin without shape and pleasure without speech and where strange dreams in a tumultuous make the shut eyes of stricken spirits weep and with each face thou sawest the shadow on each seeing as men sow men reap o sleepless heart and sombre soul unsleeping that were athirst for sleep and no more and no more love for peace and no more strife now the dim gods of death have in their spirit and body and all the springs of song is it well now where love can do no wrong where stingless pleasure has no foam or behind the unopening closure of her lips is it not well where soul from body and flesh from bone divides without a as dew from flower bell drips it is enough the end and the are one thing to thee who art past the end o hand of unbeholden friend for thee no fruits to pluck no palms for winning no triumph and no labour and no lust only dead yew leaves and a little dust o quiet eyes wherein the light saith naught whereto the day is dumb nor any with obscure finger silences your sight nor in your speech the sudden soul speaks thought sleep and have sleep for light now all strange hours and all strange loves are over dreams and desires and sombre songs and sweet hast thou found place at the great knees and of some pale titan woman like a lover such as thy vision here solicited under the shadow of her fair vast head the deep division of prodigious breasts the solemn slope of mighty limbs asleep the weight of awful tresses that still the savour and shade of old world pine where the wet hill winds weep hast thou found any likeness for thy vision o gardener of strange flowers what bud what bloom hast thou found sown what in the gloom what of despair of rapture of derision what of life is there what of ill or good are the fruits gray like dust or bright like blood does the dim ground grow any seed of ours the faint fields quicken any terrene root in low lands where the sun and moon are and all the stars keep silence are there at all or any fruit alas but though my flying song flies after o sweet strange elder singer thy more singing and footprints of thy fleeter feet some dim derision of mysterious from the blind tongueless warders of the dead some gainless glimpse of head some little sound of unregarded wept by effaced unprofitable eyes and from pale mouths some cadence of dead sighs these only these the hearkening spirit hears sees only such things rise thou art far too far for wings of words to follow far too far off for thought or any prayer what ails us with thee who art wind and air what ails us gazing where all seen is hollow yet with some fancy yet with some desire dreams pursue death as winds a flying fire our dreams pursue our dead and do not find still and more swift than they the thin flame flies the low light fails us in elusive skies still the earnest ear is deaf and are still the eluded eyes not thee o never thee in all changes not thee but this the sound of thy sad soul the shadow of thy swift spirit this shut i lay my hand on and not death my spirit from communion of thy song these memories and these melodies that porches of a muse funereal these i salute these touch these clasp and as though a hand were in my hand to hold or through mine ears a mourning of many mourners i among these i also in such as when the pyre was and piled the sods and offering to the dead made and their gods the old mourners had standing to make libation i stand and to the gods and to the do reverence without prayer or praise and offering to these unknown the gods

desolate city dark to me is the earth dark to me are the heavens where is she that i loved the woman with eyes like stars desolate are the streets desolate is the city a city taken by storm where none are left but the slain sadly i rose at dawn undid the latch of my shutters thinking to let in light but i only let in love birds in the boughs were awake i to their chaunting each one sang to his love only i was alone this i said in my heart is the hour of life and of pleasure now each creature on earth has his joy and lives in the sun each in eyes finds light the light of compassion this is the moment of pity this is the moment of love speak o desolate city speak o silence in sadness where is she that i loved in my strength that spoke to my soul where are those passionate eyes that to my eyes in passion where is the mouth that me the breast i laid to my own speak thou soul of my soul for rage in my heart is kindled tell me where didst thou flee in the day of destruction and fear see my arms still enfold thee enfolding thus all heaven see my desire is in thee for it fills the earth thus in my grief i lamented then i from the window to the stair and the open door and the empty street crying aloud in my grief for there was none to chide me none to mock my weakness none to behold my tears groping i went as blind i sought her house my there i at the silent door and and tried the latch love i cried dost thou slumber this is no hour for slumber this is the hour of love and love i bring in my hand i knew the house with its windows and its leafless fig tree climbing round by the doorstep the only one in the street i knew where my hope had to its goal and there all that those desolate walls once held my heart there in my grief she consoled me she loved me when i loved not she put her hand in my hand and set her lips to my lips she told me all her pain and me all her trouble i like a fool scarce heard hardly her kiss love thy eyes were like torches they changed as i beheld them love thy lips were like gems the seal thou settest on my life love if i loved not then behold this hour thy vengeance this is the fruit of thy love and thee the unwise grown wise weeping strangled my voice i out but none blindly the windows gazed back at me dumbly the door she whom i love who loved me not on my yearning gave me no more her hands to kiss me no more her soul therefore the earth is dark to me the sunlight blackness therefore i go in tears and alone by night and day therefore i find no love in heaven no light no beauty a heaven taken by storm where none are left but the slain 818 with esther he who has once been happy is for out of reach his fortune holds nothing secret and eternity which is a mystery to other men has like a woman given him its joy time is his conquest life if it should fret has paid him tribute he can bear to die he who has once been happy when i the world before me and survey its range its mean ambitions its scant fantasies the shreds of pleasure which for lack of men wrap around them and call happiness the poor delights which are the tale and of the courage in its martyrdom when i hear laughter from a tavern door when i see crowds agape and in the watching on tiptoe and with stifled to see a rocket fired or a bull slain when misers handle gold when touch strong hearts with glory till they weep when cities deck their streets for barren which have laid waste their youth and when i calmly the count of my own life and on what poor stuff my dreams were till i too what dole of will serve a human soul for daily bread then i remember that i once was and lived with esther the gods among 819 to manon on his fortune in loving her i did not choose thee dearest it was that made the choice not i mine eyes were as a rude who to some lone his offering brings and cares not at what he bends his knee the gifts alone were mine the rest was he took me by the hand and fired the sacrifice and poured the wine and spoke the words i might not understand i was unwise in all but the dear which was my fortune and the blind which led my foolish steps to abode and sublime which raised an altar and inscribed in its dedication to the

love i left the dead rose where it and set the new above why did my summer not begin why did my heart not haste my old love came and therein and laid the garden waste she with her weary smile just as of old she around a little and with the cold her passing touch was death to all her passing look a blight she made the white rose petals fall and the red rose white her pale robe clinging to the like a that bit the grass and ground alas and a sad trail did make she went up slowly to the gate and then just as of yore she back at the last to and say farewell once more 830 the fountain of tears if you go over desert and mountain far into the country of sorrow to day and to night and to morrow and maybe for months and for years you shall come with a heart that is for trouble and toiling and thirsting you shall certainly come to the at length to the fountain of tears very peaceful the place is and for piteous lamenting and sighing and those who come living or alike from their hopes and their fears full of cypress like shadows the place is and statues that cover their faces but out of the gloom springs the and beautiful fountain of tears and it flows and it flows with a so gentle and lovely and listless and murmurs a tune so to him who hath and hears you shall surely without a word spoken kneel down there and know your heart broken and yield to the long that day by the fountain of tears for it grows and it grows as though up higher the more one is thinking and ever its tunes go on more poignantly into the ears yea so blessèd and good seems that fountain after dry desert and mountain you shall fall down at length in your and bathe your sad face in the tears then alas while you lie there a and sob between living and dying and give up the land you were to find your hopes and your fears o the world shall come up and pass you strong men shall not stay to care for you nor wonder indeed for what your way should seem harder than theirs but perhaps while you lie never your cheek from the wet leaves it presses nor caring to raise your wet and look how the cold world appears o perhaps the mere silences round you all things in that place grief hath found you yea to the clouds you drifting may soothe you somewhat through your tears you may feel when a falling leaf your face as though some one had you or think at least some one who had sent you a thought if that cheers or a little song faint and broken may pass for a tender word spoken enough while around you there that life drowning torrent of tears and the tears shall flow faster and faster brim over and baffle resistance and roll down roads to each of past desolation and years till they cover the place of each sorrow and leave you no past and no morrow for what man is able to and stem the great fountain of tears but the floods and the tears meet and gather the sound of them all grows like thunder o into what bosom i wonder is the whole sorrow of years for eternity only seems account of the great human weeping may god then the maker and father may he find a place for the tears boyle 831 a white rose the red rose whispers of passion and the white rose breathes of love o the red rose is a falcon and the white rose is a dove but i send you a cream white with a flush on its petal tips for the love that is purest and has a kiss of desire on the lips 832 my delight and thy delight my delight and thy walking like two angels white in the gardens of the night my desire and thy twining to a tongue of fire leaping live and laughing higher the everlasting in the mystery of life love

away full three days were not sped i caught my fancy thinking if she were dead and i alone alone it in my in all the world was ever so lone as i i wept but it did not nor comfort my heart i rode as i might and to my love at close of day the sight of her my fears my fairest hearted love and yet in her eyes were tears which when i questioned of now thou art come she cried fled but i thought to i never could here abide if thou wert longer away 837 on a dead child perfect little body without fault or stain on thee with promise of strength and manhood full and fair though cold and stark and bare the bloom and the charm of life doth awhile remain on thee thy treasure wert thou alas no to visit her heart with wondrous joy to thy pride ah must gather his faith together and his strength make stronger to me as i move thee now in the last duty dost thou with a turn or gesture anon respond startling my fancy with a chance attitude of the head a freak of beauty thy hand clasps as wont my finger and holds it but the grasp is the clasp of death heartbreaking and stiff yet feels to my hand as still thy will thy pleasure and trust that enfolds it so i lay thee there thy sunken eyelids closing go lie thou there in thy coffin thy last little bed propping thy wise sad head thy firm pale hands across thy chest disposing so quiet doth the change content thee death whither hath he taken thee to a world do i think that rights the disaster of this the vision of which i miss who weep for the body and wish but to warm thee and awaken thee ah little at best can all our hopes avail to lift

with their magic flood me through the gateway of the eyes i am one with the dream when the trees and skies and fields are one in dusky mood every heart of man is rapt within the breast full of peace and sleep and dreams in the vasty quietude i am one with their hearts at rest from our immemorial joys of hearth and home and away along the margin of the unknown tide all its reach of soundless calm can thrill me far word or touch from the lips beside aye and deep and deep and deeper let me drink and from the olden fountain more than light or peace or dream such primæval being as the heart with awe growing one with its silent stream 873 the great breath its edges with amethyst and rose withers once more the old blue flower of day there where the ether like a diamond glows its petals fade away a shadowy tumult stirs the dusky air sparkle the delicate dews the distant snows the great deep thrills for through it the breath of beauty blows i saw how all the trembling ages past moulded to her by deep and deeper breath to the hour when beauty breathes her and knows herself in death sturge 874 a duet nodding gaily scent in air flowers posied flowers for the hair sleepy flowers flowers bold to stare pick me some with lip or tooth or bleeding gum tell tale shells and shells that whisper come shells that stammer blush and yet are dumb let me hear so black they draw one trembling near brown eyes caverns flooded with a tear cloudless eyes blue eyes so windy clear look at me sadly blown across the sea darkling kisses kisses fair and free bob a cherry kisses a tree give me one thus sang a king and queen in babylon 875 the poppy summer set lip to bosom bare and left the print in a poppy there like a yawn of fire from the grass it came and the fanning wind it to flapping flame with burnt mouth red like a it the blood of the sun as he sank and its cup in the purpurate when the eastern conduits ran with wine till it grew lethargied with fierce bliss and hot as a swinkèd gipsy is and drowsed in sleepy savageries with mouth wide a pout for a sultry kiss a child and man paced side by side treading the skirts of eventide but between the clasp of his hand and lay felt not twenty years she with the rout of her dusk south hair and saw the sleeping gipsy there and and it in swift whim with it long as you live to him and his smile as nymphs from their laving meres trembled up from a bath of tears and joy like a mew sea apart on the wave of his troubled heart for he saw what she did not see that as kindled by its own fervency the verge inward smoulderingly and suddenly his hand and he knew the twenty withered years no flower but twenty shrivelled years never such thing until this hour low to his heart he said of sleep brings wakening to me and of oblivion memory never this thing to me he said with bruisèd poppies my feet are red and again to his own heart very low child i love for i love and know you who love nor know at the diverse chambers in guest hall where some rise early few sit long in how differing accents hear the his great pentecostal tongue know not love from amity nor my reported self from me a fair fit gift is this meseems you give this withering flower of dreams frankly fickle and fickly true do you know what the days will do to you to your love and you what the days will do o frankly fickle and fickly true have loved me fair three lives or days pass with the passing of my face but where i go your face goes too to watch lest i play false to you am but my sweet your foster lover knowing well when certain years are you vanish from me to another yet i know and love like the foster mother frankly fickle and fickly true for my brief life while i take from this token fair and fit meseems for me this withering flower of dreams the sleep flower sways in the wheat its head heavy with dreams as that with bread the goodly grain and the sun the reaper reaps and time the reaper i hang men my needless head and my fruit is dreams as theirs is bread the goodly men and the sun hazed time shall reap but after the the world shall glean of me me the sleeper love love your flower of in leavèd rhyme lies safe i deem and shut in a nook of rhyme from the reaper man and his reaper time love i fall into the claws of time but lasts within a leavèd all that the world of me esteems my dreams my dreams 876 non nobis not unto us o lord not unto us the rapture of the day the peace of night or divine surprise high heart high speech high deeds honouring eyes for at thy all these are taken away not unto us o lord to us thou givest the scorn the scourge the scar the ache of life the loneliness of death the insufferable sufficiency of breath and with thy thou piercest very far not unto us o lord nay lord but unto her be all things given my light and life and earth and sky be blasted but let not all that wealth of loss be wasted let hell the pavement of her heaven tynan 877 sheep and lambs all in the april morning april airs were abroad the sheep with their little me by on the road the sheep with their little me by on the road all in an april i thought on the lamb of god the lambs were weary and with a weak human cry i thought on the lamb of going meekly to die up in the blue blue dewy pastures are sweet rest for the little bodies rest for the little feet rest for the lamb of up on the hill top green only a cross of two stark crosses between all in the april evening april airs were abroad i saw the sheep with their lambs and thought on the lamb of god 878 an upper chamber i came into the city and none knew me none came forth none shouted is here not a hand with laurel would bestrew me all the way by which i drew anear night my banner and my herald fear but i knew where one so long had in the low room at the height trembling lest my foot should be belated singing sighing for the long towards the moment of our dear delight i came into the city when you saviour and again your chosen lord not one guessing what it was that me while along the way as they thousands thousands shouted in accord but through all the joy i knew i only how the hostel of my heart lay bare and cold silent of its music and how lonely never though you crown me with your gold shall i find that little chamber as of old 879 renouncement i must not think of thee and tired yet strong i shun the love that lurks in all delight the love of thee and in the blue height and in the dearest passage of a song oh just beyond the sweetest thoughts that this breast the thought of thee waits hidden yet bright but it must never never come in sight i must stop short of thee the whole day long but when sleep comes to close each difficult day when night gives pause to the long watch i keep and all my bonds i needs must loose apart must doff my will as raiment laid away with the first dream that comes with the first i run i run i am to thy heart 880 the lady of the lambs she walks the lady of my delight a shepherdess of sheep her flocks are thoughts she keeps them white she guards them from the steep she feeds them on the fragrant and folds them in for sleep she roams maternal hills and bright dark valleys safe and deep her dreams are innocent at night the chastest stars may peep she walks the lady of my delight a shepherdess of sheep she holds her little thoughts in sight though gay they run and leap she is so circumspect and right she has her soul to keep she walks the lady of my delight a shepherdess of sheep 881 ireland the dream of a god and the mould of his hand that you shook his stroke that you trembled and to this beautiful land here he loosed from his a brown tumult of wings till the wind on the bore the strange of an island that sings he made you all fair you in purple and gold you in silver and green till no eye that has without love can behold i have left you in the path of the past with the white breath of flowers with the best of hours i have left you at last l 882 genius loci peace shepherd peace what boots it singing on since long ago grace giving phœbus died and all the train that loved the stream bright of the poetic mount with him are beyond the shores of styx and acheron in unexplorèd realms of night to hide the clouds that strew their shadows far and are all of heaven that visits helicon yet here where never muse or god did haunt still may some nameless power of nature stray pleased with the reedy continual and purple pomp of these broad fields in may the shepherds meet him where he herds the kine and careless pass him by whose is the gift divine d 883 dominus illuminatio mea in the hour of death after this whim when the heart beats low and the eyes grow dim and pain has exhausted every limb the lover of the lord shall trust in him when the will has forgotten the lifelong aim and the mind can only disgrace its fame and a man is uncertain of his own name the power of the lord shall fill this frame when the last sigh is heaved and the last tear shed and the coffin is waiting beside the bed and the widow and child forsake the dead the angel of the lord shall lift this head for even the purest delight may pall and power must fail and the pride must fall and the love of the
