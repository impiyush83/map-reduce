prologue

the bride





             a man of reverend age 

    but stout and hale      



                                                               wordsworth 



    a wife’s be the cheapest ov hands 



                                                           william barnes 



the sale was over  live stock  implements  corn and hay  turnips and

potatoes  even apples  had duly been entered to their various buyers  and

now such smaller articles as milk pails  cheese tubs  cream tins  weights

and scales  and other items of a dairy farmer’s gear were passing under

the hammer   the auction had been well attended  for it had been known

beforehand that things would go cheap  and though the melancholy

circumstances under which the sale took place called forth many

expressions of regret and compassion  they in no way lessened the general

eagerness to secure good bargains 



old giles stelling had always kept pace with the times  and had been

among the first to adopt new appliances and avail himself of the lights

which advancing science throws even upon the avocations of the farmer 

he had gone a little too fast  as his neighbours now agreed with many

doleful ‘ah’s’ and ‘ayes’ and shakings of heads   all these grand new

machines of his had helped to precipitate the catastrophe which had

overtaken him—a catastrophe which was tragic indeed  for the old farmer 

overcome by the prospect of impending ruin  had been carried off by an

apoplectic fit even before this enforced sale of his effects 



nevertheless  though many considered these strange new fangled

reapers and binders  these unnatural looking double ploughs  a kind of

flying in the face of providence  a few spirited individuals had made up

their minds to bid for them  and one energetic purchaser had even driven

eighteen miles from the other side of the county to secure one

particularly complicated machine 



the bidding was still proceeding briskly in the great barn when this

person shouldered his way through the crowd and made a tour of inspection

of the premises  previous to setting forth again on his return journey 

he was a middle sized elderly man  with bright blue eyes that looked

forth kindly if keenly from beneath bushy grizzled brows  the ruddy face 

set off by a fringe of white beard and whisker  looked good humoured and

prosperous enough  but the somewhat stooping shoulders bore witness to

the constant and arduous labour which had been elias fiander’s lot in

early life 



he sauntered across the great yard  so desolate to day albeit crowded at

the upper end nearest the barn  the suspension of the ordinary life of

the place gave it an air of supreme melancholy and even loneliness   the

cattle thrusting at each other in their enclosures and bellowing

dismally  the sheep hurdled off in convenient lots  the very fowl penned

up and squawking lamentably  for the more valuable specimens were tied

together in bunches by the legs—all these dumb things seemed to have a

kind of instinctive understanding that something unusual and tragic was

going forward 



‘poor beasts  they do make a deal o’ noise ’ muttered elias half aloud 

‘a body might think they was a cryin’ for their master   well  well  ’t

is an ill wind what blows nobody good  and that there turnip hoer was a

wonderful bargain   it won’t do him no harm as i should ha’ picked it up

so cheap   nay  nay  ’t won’t do him no harm where he be gone to  and i

might as well ha’ bought it as another ’



having satisfied a passing twinge of conscience with this reflection  he

stepped into the great rickyard  and stood a moment gazing from one to

the other of the golden and russet stacks 



‘prime stuff ’ he muttered to himself   ‘that be real old hay in the

corner  and this here wheat rick—there’s a goodish lot o’ money in that

or i’m much mistaken   here be another  half thrashed—ah  fine stuff   ’t

is a pity the poor old master did n’t live to see the end o’ that

job—though if the money were n’t a goin’ into his own pocket he wouldn’t

ha’ been much the better for ’t ’



he was wandering round the rick in question  gazing at it from every

point  and even thrusting his hands upwards into the loosened sheaves of

that portion which had been unroofed and partially thrashed  when a

sudden rustle close to him made him start 



lo  perched high upon the ledge of the half demolished stack a figure was

standing  knee deep among the roughly piled up sheaves  the tall and

shapely figure of a young girl   she was dressed in black  and from under

the wide sombre brim of her straw hat a pair of blue eyes looked down

fiercely at the farmer   the face in which they were set was oval in

shape  and at that moment very pale  the lips were parted  showing a

gleam of white teeth 



‘why  my dear ’ said fiander  stepping a little further away from the

stack and gazing up at her in mild astonishment—‘why  whatever might you

be doin’ up there   you did gi’ me quite a start  i do assure ye ’



‘i’m looking at something i don’t like to see ’ returned the girl in a

choked voice  and her bosom heaved with a quick angry sob 



‘ah ’ said the other tentatively   setting his hat a little further back

on his head and wrinkling up his eyes he examined her more closely   the

black dress  the wrathful  miserable face told their own tale   ‘i do

’low ye be somebody belongin’ to the poor old master ’ he continued

respectfully 



she sobbed again for all response 



‘ah ’ said fiander again  with a world of sympathy in his blue eyes  ‘’t

is a melancholy sight for ye  sure   you’re mr  stelling’s daughter very

like ’



‘granddaughter ’ corrected the girl 



‘dear heart alive  ’t is sad—’t is very sad for ye  miss  but i’m sure

i’d never keep a standin’ on the stack frettin’ yourself so  i would n’t 

truly   ’t is a very sad business altogether  miss stelling  but you’ll

be upsettin’ yourself worse if ye bide here ’



the girl stepped across the sheaves and drew near the edge of the stack 

fiander stretched out his hand to assist her down 



‘that’s it ’ he remarked encouragingly  ‘i’m main glad to see you are so

sensible and ready to take advice  miss stelling   here  let me help ye

down ’



‘no  thank you ’ she replied  ‘and my name is n’t stelling ’



stooping  and supporting herself with one hand against the edge of the

ledge  she swung herself gracefully down  her hat dropping off as she did

so  the face thus exposed to view proved even younger than fiander had

anticipated  and  were he a more impressionable man  he might well have

been startled at its beauty 



even though he had attained the respectable age of fifty eight and had

not long buried a most faithful and hard working helpmate  the worthy

farmer was conscious of a glow of admiration   though the girl’s eyes

were blue  the hair and brows were distinctly dark  and the complexion of

the brunette order—a combination somewhat unusual and very striking   her

figure was  as has been said  tall and slight  yet with vigour as well as

grace in every movement  she alighted on the ground as easily and as

lightly as though she had been a bird 



‘well done ’ ejaculated fiander   ‘and what might your name be if it

bain’t stelling ’



‘my name is goldring ’ she replied a little haughtily   ‘rosalie

goldring   my mother was mr  stelling’s daughter ’



‘well now ’ returned the farmer  smiling cheerfully  ‘goldring  and

that’s a pretty name too—partic’lar for a maid—a token i might say 

rosalie did you tell me  miss   i do mind a song as i used to hear when i

were a boy about rosalie the prairie flower ’  she had picked up her hat

and stood gazing at him discontentedly 



‘i suppose everything is sold by this time ’ she said   ‘my dear

grandfather’s mare  and the trap  and even my cocks and hens   dear

grandfather  he always used to tell me that everything in the whole place

was to be mine when he died—and now they won’t so much as leave me the

old rooster ’



‘poor maid ’ ejaculated fiander  full of commiseration  and guiltily

conscious of having bought that turnip hoer a bargain   ‘’t is

unfort’nate for ye  i’m sure   did n’t your grandfather make no provision

for ’ee ’



‘oh  it is n’t that i mind ’ retorted rosalie quickly  ‘it’s seeing

everything go   everything that i love—all the live things that i knew

and used to take care of—even my churn  and my cheese presses—granfer

used always to say i was wonderful about cheese making—and the pails and

pans out of my dairy—everything that i kept so nice and took such pride

in   they’ll all go to strangers now—all scattered about  one here  one

there   and to morrow they’ll be selling the things out of the house   if

they leave me the clothes i stand up in that’ll be all ’



she sobbed so pitifully and looked so forlorn that fiander’s heart was

positively wrung 



‘my word ’ he ejaculated  ‘i do ’low it’s hard—’t is that  ’t is cruel

hard  what was ye thinkin’ o’ doin’  my dear   you’ll have some relations

most like as ’ll be glad to take ye in ’



‘i have n’t a relation in the world ’ returned rosalie with another sob 

‘i had nobody but grandfather   if i had ’ she added quickly  ‘i don’t

know that i should have gone to them—i don’t like to be beholden to

anybody   i’ll earn my own bread  though i don’t know how i shall do it 

grandfather could never bear the notion of my going to service ’



‘ah  and could n’t he ’ returned fiander  deeply interested 



‘no  indeed   of course when he was alive we never thought of things

coming to this pass   he always told me i should be mistress here when he

was gone  and that i should be well off   dear granfer  he grudged me

nothing ’



‘such a good education as he gi’ed ye too ’ observed elias

commiseratingly 



‘oh  yes   i was at boarding school for three years   i can play the

piano and work the crewel work  and i learnt french ’



‘dear heart alive ’ groaned fiander  ‘and now ye be a thrown upon the

world   but i was meanin’ another kind of education   cheese making and

dairy work and that—you was sayin’ you was a good hand at suchlike ’

while he spoke he eyed her sharply  and listened eagerly for the

response 



‘yes  yes ’ agreed rosalie  ‘i can do all that   we made all kinds of

cheeses every day in the winter  “ramil ” and “ha’skim ” and “blue vinny”

and all   yes  i was kept busy—my butter always took top price in the

market  and then there were the accounts to make up of an evening   my

life was n’t all play  i can tell you  but i was very happy ’



‘my missus ’ remarked fiander  following out his own train of

thoughts—‘that’s the second one  i buried her a year come michaelmas—she

was a wonderful hand at the ha’skim cheeses   a very stirring body she

was   i do miss her dreadful  and these here dairy women as ye hire they

be terrible folk for waste—terrible   i reckon i’ll be a lot out of

pocket this year ’



‘we all have our troubles  you see ’ said rosalie  with tears still

hanging on her black lashes   ‘well  i thank you for your kind words 

sir  they seem to have done me good   i think i’ll go in  now   i don’t

want to meet any of the folk ’



‘bide a bit  my dear ’ said the farmer  ‘bide a bit   i’ve summat to ax

ye   you bain’t thinkin’ of going to service  ye say  and ye don’t

rightly know where to look for a home ’



rosalie stared at him   he was laughing in a confused  awkward way  and

his face was growing redder and redder   before she could answer he went

on 



‘there’s your name now—it be a pretty ’un   i do ’low it ’ud seem almost

a pity to change it  an’ yet if ye was to lose the name ye might get the

thing ’



‘i don’t understand you  sir ’ cried she  growing red in her turn 



‘why  goldring  you know   ’t is a token  as i said jist now   if you was

to get married you would n’t be goldring no more  and yet ye’d be getting

a gold ring  d’ye see—a weddin’ ring ’



‘oh ’ said rosalie distantly 



‘if i might make so bold as to ax  have ye been a keepin’ company wi’ any

young man  miss ’



‘no ’ she returned  ‘i don’t care for young men ’



‘well done ’ cried fiander excitedly  ‘well done  my dear   that shows

your spirit   come  what ’ud ye say to an old one ’



his blue eyes were nearly jumping out of his head  his honest face was

all puckered into smiles 



‘come ’ he cried  ‘’t is an offer   here be i  an old one  yet not so

very old neither  and uncommon tough   i wants a missus terrible bad 

i’ve a been on the look out for one this half year  but i did n’t expect

to take up with a leading article like you   well  and ye be lookin’ for

a home  and ye bain’t a keepin’ company wi’ nobody   i ’d make ye so

comfortable as ever i could   i ’d not grudge ye nothing  no more than

your grandfather   i’ve a worked hard all my life and i’ve got together a

nice bit o’ money  and bought my farm   there’s seventy head of milch

cows on it now  not to speak o’ young beasts and pigs and that   ye might

be missus there  and make so many cheeses as ever ye pleased   how old

might ye be  my maid ’



‘eighteen ’ returned rosalie tremulously  she had been gazing at him with

large startled eyes  but had made no attempt to interrupt him 



‘eighteen   well  and i’m fifty eight   there’s forty years a tween us 

but  lord  what’s forty years   i can mind when i were eighteen year of

age the same as if ’t were yesterday  and i can mind as i did think

myself as old and as wise as i be now   come  my dear  what’s forty year 

i’m hale and hearty  and i’d be so good to ye as ever i could  and you be

lonesome and desolate—thrown upon the world  as i say   come  let’s make

it up together comfortable   say the word  and ye can snap your fingers

at anyone who interferes wi’ ye   my place is just so big as this—bigger 

well  now  is it a bargain ’



‘i think it is ’ murmured rosalie   ‘i—i don’t know what else to do  and

i think you look kind ’



                                           



late on that same evening mr  fiander reached home  and after attending

to his horse and casting a cursory glance round to ascertain that nothing

had gone wrong in his absence  he betook himself across the fields to the

house of his next neighbour and great crony  isaac sharpe 



he found his friend seated in the armchair by the chimney corner   isaac 

being a bachelor man  paid small heed to the refinements which were

recently beginning to be in vogue among his class  and habitually sat in

the kitchen   the old woman who acted as housekeeper to him had gone

home  and he was alone in the wide  flagged room  which looked cheerful

enough just now  lit up as it was by the wood fire  which danced gaily on

the yellow walls  and threw gigantic shadows of the hams and flitches

suspended from the great oaken beams  on the ceiling   he was just in the

act of shaking out the ashes from his pipe  previous to retiring for the

night  when elias entered  and greeted him with no small astonishment 



‘be it you  ’lias   i were just a goin’ to lock up and go to roost ’



elias creaked noisily across the great kitchen  and  standing opposite

sharpe in the chimney corner  looked down at him for a moment without

speaking   the other tapped his pipe on the iron hob nearest him and

continued to gaze interrogatively at the new comer   he was about the

same age as fiander but looked younger  his burly form being straight and

his sunburnt face more lightly touched by the hand of time   hair  beard 

and whiskers  alike abundant  were of a uniform pepper and salt—there

being more pepper than salt in the mixture  when he smiled he displayed a

set of teeth in no less excellent preservation 



as elias continued to gaze down at him with an odd sheepish expression 

and without speaking  he himself took the initiative 



‘ye called round to tell me about the sale  i suppose   well  i take it

very kind of ye  ’lias  though i was n’t for your goin’ after that

new fangled machine   i do ’low ye’ll ha’ give a big price for ’t ’



his tone had a tinge of severity  and it was noticeable throughout that

his attitude towards fiander was somewhat dictatorial  though in truth

fiander was the older as well as the richer man 



‘nay now  nay now ’ the latter returned quickly  ‘ye be wrong for once 

isaac   ’t is a wonderful bargain  things was goin’ oncommon cheap 

there was hurdles to be picked up for next to nothin’   i were a thinkin’

of you  isaac  and a wishin’ ye’d ha’ comed wi’ me   yes  hurdles was

goin’ wonderful cheap   they’d ha’ come in handy for your sheep ’



isaac grunted  since he had not thought fit to accompany his friend  he

was rather annoyed at being told of the bargains he had missed 



‘it was a long way to travel ’ he remarked   ‘did you have to go into

dorchester ’



‘nay i turned off by yellowham hill   banford’s about four mile out o’

dorchester  and i cut off a good bit that way ’



‘well  ye’ve a got the hoer ’ grunted isaac   ‘did you bid for anything

else ’



‘no  i did n’t bid for it ’ returned elias with a sheepish chuckle  ‘but

i’ve a met with a wonderful piece of luck out yonder ’



he paused  slowly rubbed his hands  chuckled again  and  finally bending

down so that his face was on a level with sharpe’s  said slowly and

emphatically 



‘isaac  you’ll be a hearing summat on sunday as ’ull surprise ye ’



isaac  who from force of habit had replaced his empty pipe in his mouth 

now took it out  gaped at his interlocutor for a full half minute  and

finally said 



‘what be i a goin’ to hear o’ sunday ’



‘banns   my banns ’ announced fiander  triumphant  but shamefaced too 



‘what ’ ejaculated isaac  in a tone of immeasurable disgust   ‘ye be at

it again  be ye   i never did see sich a man for wedlock   why  this here

’ull make the third of ’em ’



‘come ’ returned elias plaintively  ‘that’s none of my fault   my

missuses don’t last—that’s where ’t is   i did think the last ’un ’ud ha’

done my time  but she goes an’ drops off just at our busiest season   if

i be so much o’ a marryin’ man  ’t is because the lord in his

mystreerious ways has seen fit to deal hardly wi’ i   ye know as well as

me  don’t ye  isaac  as a dairy farmer can’t get on nohow wi’out a wife ’



‘aye  ’t is what i’ve always said ’ agreed isaac   ‘there may be profit

in the dairy farming  but there’s a deal o’ risk   what wi’ cows dyin’ 

and bein’ forced to toll a woman about  ’t is more bother nor it’s worth 

why did n’t ye do same as me  and keep sheep and grow roots   ah  what

with roots  and what with corn  a man can get on as well that way as your

way—and there’s less risk ’



‘well  i’ve a been brought up to it  d’ye see  isaac—that’s it   my

father was a dairyman before me—in a less way  to be sure   ah  it were a

struggle for him  i tell ye   he did ha’ to pay thirteen pound for every

cow he rented of old meatyard  what was master then   thirteen pound 

think of that   why  i used to hear him say as pounds and pounds went

through his hands before he could count as he’d made a penny ’



‘ah ’ remarked mr  sharpe  with the placid interest of one who hears an

oft told tale   but then pastures and house rent and all were counted in

that—your father paid no rent for ’em  did he   and meatyard found him in

cows  and kept him in hay and oil cake and that ’



‘yes ’ agreed elias unwillingly  for the enumeration of these extenuating

circumstances detracted from the picturesque aspect of the case   ‘oh 

yes  he did that  but my father he al’ays said it were a poor way o’

makin’ a livin’   “save up  ’lias  my boy ” he al’ays did use to say to

i   “save up and buy a bit o’ land for yourself ”  so i scraped and

scrimped and laid by  and my first missus  she were a very thrifty body 

a very thrifty body she were   she put her shoulder to the wheel too  and

when old meatyard died we bought the farm  and things did prosper wi’ us

very well since—till my last poor wife died  then all did go wrong wi’ i 

aye  as i say  if i do seem more set on matrimony than other folks  ’t is

because the lord ha’ marked i out for ’t   now you  isaac  never was

called that way  seemingly ’



‘nay ’ agreed isaac  ‘i never were a called that way   i never could do

wi’ women folk about   i’ve seed too much of ’em when i were a young ’un 

lord  what a cat and dog life my poor father and mother did lead  to be

sure   he liked a drop o’ drink  my father did  and when he’d had a glass

too much i’ve seen my mother pull the hair out of his head by

handfuls—ah  that i have   but father  he’d never complain   soon as she

’d leave go of him he’d stoop down and pick up all the hair as she ’d

a pulled out of his head   he’d put it in a box—ah  many’s the time he’ve

a showed it to me arter him and her had had a fallin’ out  and he’d say

to me  “never you go fur to get married  my boy ” and i’d say  “nay 

father ” and i’ve a kept my word ’



‘your poor sister kep’ house for you a good bit  though  did n’t she 

after she lost her husband   and you were uncommon fond o’ the boy ’



‘yes  it be different wi’ a sister—particularly one as knows she have n’t

got no right to be there   she were a very quiet body  poor eliza were 

i were quite sorry when she and the little chap shifted to dorchester 

but she thought she’d do better in business ’



‘well  but you were a good friend to she ’ remarked elias  ‘both to she

and her boy   ye paid his passage to ’merica arter she died  poor thing 

did n’t ye ’



‘ah  i did pay his passage to ’merica  and i did gi’ him a bit o’ money

in hand to start wi’  out there   well  but you ha’n’t told me the name

o’ your new missus ’



‘rosalie goldring is her name ’ returned elias  lowering his voice

confidentially   ‘rosalie goldring—nice name  bain’t it   soon’s i heard

her name i took it for a kind o’ token ’



‘ah  there be a good many goldrings dorchester side ’ remarked isaac 

‘was that what took you off so far away   you’ve been a coortin’ and

never dropped a hint o’ it ’



‘nay now  i never so much as set eyes on her till this very day   but

being so bad off for a wife  and so put about wi’ all the waste as is

a goin’ on at my place  i thought i’d make sure o’ her  so i axed her 

and she were glad enough to take me—she’s giles stelling’s granddaughter 

d’ ye see  and she has to turn out now ’



‘old stelling’s granddaughter ’ repeated isaac with emphasis 

‘granddaughter   he must ha’ been a terrible old man ’



‘i do ’low he were—old enough ’ replied elias hastily   ‘well  now i’ve

a told ye the news  isaac  i think i might as well take myself home

again   my head be all in a whirl wi’ so much travellin’ and one thing

and another   good night to ye  isaac  ye must be sure an’ come over to

see the new turnip hoer to morrow ’



a little more than three weeks later fiander brought home his bride  and

isaac sharpe cleaned himself  and strolled up in the evening to

congratulate the couple   elias admitted him  his face wreathed with

smiles  and his whole person smartened up and rejuvenated 



‘come in  isaac  come in   the wife’s gone upstairs to get ready for

supper  but she’ll be down in a minute ’



‘i give you joy ’ said sharpe gruffly 



‘thank’ee  isaac  thank’ee   come in and take a chair   ye may fill your

pipe too—she does n’t object to a pipe ’



‘ who  does n’t object to a pipe ’ said isaac staring  with a great hand

on each knee 



‘why  mrs  fiander does n’t   oh  isaac  i be a favoured so   i told you

the a’mighty had marked me out for wedlock  well  i can truly say that

this here missus promises to be the best o’ the three   wait till ye see

her  and you’ll think i’m in luck ’



isaac gazed at him with a kind of stolid compassion  shook his head 

deliberately filled his pipe  and fell to smoking   elias did the same 

and after he had puffed for a moment or two broke silence 



‘ah  ye’ll find her most agree’ble   i did mention to her that you be

used to drop in of a sunday  and she did make no objections—no objections

at all ’



‘did n’t she ’ returned isaac   ‘come  that’s a good thing ’  he paused

for a moment  the veins in his forehead swelling   ‘i don’t know but if

she had made objections i should n’t ha’ come all the same ’ he continued

presently   ‘i’ve a come here sunday arter sunday for twenty year and

more   it would n’t seem very natural to stop away now ’



‘nay  sure ’ agreed fiander nervously  ‘’t would n’t seem at all

natural ’



the sound of a light foot was now heard crossing the room overhead and

descending the stairs 



‘that be her ’ remarked elias excitedly 



the door opened  and a tall well formed figure stood outlined against the

background of fire lit kitchen   it was almost dusk in the parlour where

the two men sat 



‘why  you’re all in the dark here ’ observed a cheerful voice   ‘shall i

light the lamp  elias ’



‘do  my dear  do   this here be mr  isaac sharpe  our next neighbour  as

you’ve a heard me talk on often   isaac  here’s mrs  fiander ’



isaac wedged his pipe firmly into the corner of his mouth  and extended a

large hand  according to the code of manners prevalent in that

neighbourhood  it was not considered necessary to rise when you greeted a

lady 



‘how d’ ye do  mum   i give you joy ’ he remarked 



when her hand was released mrs  fiander sought and found lamp and

matches  and removed the shade and chimney  always with such quick

decided movements that isaac remarked to himself approvingly that she was

n’t very slack about her work   she struck a match  bending over the

lamp  and suddenly the light flared up   isaac leaned forward in his

favourite attitude  a hand on either knee  and took a good look at the

new comer  then drawing himself back  and removing his pipe from his

mouth  he shot an indignant glance at fiander 



‘come  that looks more cheerful ’ remarked the unconscious bride  ‘and

supper will be ready in a minute   i’ll go and get the cloth ’



as she vanished the new made husband bent over anxiously to his friend 



‘what do you think of her ’ he remarked  jerking his thumb over his

shoulder 



‘elias ’ returned his friend wrathfully and reproachfully  ‘i did n’t

expect it of ye  no  that i did n’t   at your time of life and arter

buryin’ two of ’em   nay now  i did n’t think it of you   the least you

might do was to pick out a staid woman ’



‘come  come ’ retorted fiander  ‘she’s young  but that’ll wear off 

isaac—she’ll mend in time ’



‘it bain’t only that she be young ’ resumed sharpe  still severe and

indignant   ‘but i do think  ’lias  takin’ everything into consideration 

that it ’ud ha’ been more natural and more decent  i might say  for you

to ha’ got married to somebody more suited to ye   why  man  your new

missus be a regular beauty ’

                                                      a cumberland ballad 



sunday noontide  and a warm sunday too   the little congregation pouring

out of the ivy grown church in the hollow seemed to have found the heat

within oppressive  the men were wiping their moist brows previous to

assuming the hard uncompromising hats which alone could do justice to the

day  and the women fanned themselves with their clean white

handkerchiefs  or sniffed ostentatiously at the squat  oddly shaped

bottles of smelling salts  or nosegays of jessamine and southernwood 

with which they had provided themselves   in the village proper sundry

non churchgoers waited the return of their more pious brethren  one or

two lads sat expectantly on stiles  on the look out for their respective

sweethearts  whom they would escort homewards  and with whom they would

possibly make appointments for a stroll at some later hour of the day 

children  with important faces  might be seen returning from the

bakehouse  carefully carrying the sunday dinner covered with a clean

cloth  and a few older men and women stood about their doorsteps  or

leaned over their garden gates  with the intention of waylaying their

homeward bound neighbours and extracting from them items concerning a

very important event which had recently taken place in the vicinity 



one very fat old lady  propping herself with difficulty against the

lintel of her door  hailed her opposite neighbour eagerly 



‘good day  mrs  paddock   did ye chance to notice if master have a gone

by yet ’



‘nay  he have n’t a come this way—not so far as i know ’ returned the

other   ‘they do say he takes on terrible about poor mr  fiander ’



‘ah ’ said the first speaker with a long drawn breath  ‘he’d be like to 

i do ’low  seein’ what friends they was   folks d’ say as fiander have

very like left him summat ’



‘nay  nay  he’ll leave it all in a lump to she   he thought the world of

the missus   he’ll be sure to ha’ left it to she—wi’out she marries

again   then—well  then  very like mr  sharpe will come in   poor mr 

fiander  ’t is a sad thing to ha’ never chick nor child to leave your

money to ’



‘ah  sure  ’t is a pity they did n’t have no children   i reckon mr 

fiander looked to have ’em  seein’ he’d picked out such a fine shapely

maid   he were a fine man too  though he were gettin’ into years  to be

sure  when he wed her   not but what a body ’ud ha’ expected the old

gentleman to last a good bit longer   sixty two they d’ say he were ’



‘well  and that’s no age to speak on   lord  i were that upset when i

heerd he were took i’m not the better of it yet ’



‘ay  ’t is a terrible visitation   all as has hearts must feel it ’



‘i do assure ye  mrs  belbin  i’ve scarce closed my eyes since  and when

i do drop off towards mornin’ i do dream—’t is fearful what i do dream 

this very night  i tell ye  i thought the end had come  and we was all

a bein’ judged yon in church   the lord a’mighty hisself was a sittin’ up

in gallery a judging of we—’



‘bless me ’ interrupted mrs  belbin  ‘and what were a’mighty god like to

look on  mrs  paddock ’



‘oh  he were beautiful—wi’ broad large features and a very piercin’

eye—but he had a beautiful smile   i thought  if ye can understand  that

some was a goin’ up to the right and some to the left   yes  we was all

bein’ judged  taking our turns   squire fust  and then his lady  and then

all the young ladies and gentlemen a goin’ up one after t’ other and

a bein’ judged—’



‘well  well ’ commented mrs  belbin  throwing up her eyes and hands 

‘all so natural like  wa’ n’t it ’



she had evidently been much impressed by the strict order of precedence

observed by the actors in this visionary drama 



‘well  then i seed farmers a goin’ up—’



‘did ye see poor farmer fiander ’ inquired the other eagerly 



‘nay  nay   he were n’t there  strange to say   ’t ’ud ha’ been natural

to see him—him bein’ dead  ye know—but he were n’t there   but i see

master a bein’ judged ’



‘did ye  now  and where did he go   he’s a good man—he ’d be like to go

up’ards   were hamworthy there—the butcher  i mean   i wonder what the

a’mighty ’ud say to the short weights that he do give us poor folk ’



‘nay  i did n’t see him  fur it were a comin’ nigh my turn  and i were

that a feared i could n’t think o’ nothin’ else   and when i did get up

to walk up under gallery i thought my legs did give way and down i

plumped—and that did awaken me up ’



‘well  it was a wonderful dream  mrs  paddock   i’m not surprised as you

be feelin’ a bit poorly to day   ’t is astonishing what folks d’ dream

when they’re upset   i do assure ye when my stummick’s a bit out of order

i’m hag rid all night   last sunday ’t was  i did dream i seed a great

big toad sittin’ on piller  and i hollered out and hit at him  and belbin

he cotched me by the hand  “good gracious ” says he  “what be’st thumpin’

me like that for ”  “why ” says i  “bain’t there a toad on piller ”  “nay

now ” says he  “there’s nothin’ at all  but you’ve a hit me sich a crack

upon the chops that i’ll lay i’ll have the toothache for a week ”’



‘i’d never go for to say as dreams did n’t mean summat  though ’ said

mrs  paddock 



‘aye  i’ve great faith in dreams and tokens and sich   ye mind old maria

gillingham   folks always used to think her a bit of a witch  but she

never did nobody much harm seemingly   it were but the day before she

died as i did meet her   “you look poorly  maria ” says i   “i be like to

be poorly  mrs  paddock ” says she   “i’m near my end ” she says   “i ’ve

had a token ”  “you don’t tell me ” says i   “yes ” she said   “i were

a sittin’ in chimbly corner just now  and three great blue bottles did

come flyin’ in wi’ crape upon their wings  and they did fly three times

round my head  and they did say   soon gone     soon gone     soon

gone  ”’



‘ah ’ commented mrs  belbin  ‘and she were soon gone  were n’t she ’



‘she were ’ agreed mrs  paddock lugubriously   ‘they did find her lyin’

wi’ her head under the table next day  stone dead         but here’s rose

bundy a comin’ down the road   well  rose  was the widow in church ’



‘ay  i seed her ’ cried rose  a fat red cheeked girl  with round black

eyes at this moment gleaming with excitement   ‘she did have on such

lovely weeds—ye never saw such weeds   there was crape on ’em very nigh

all over   she did have a great long fall as did come to her knees very

near  and another much the same a hanging down at the back o’ her bonnet 

and her skirt was covered with crape—and i think there was truly more

black than white to her han’kercher   ah  it was a goin’ all the time

under her veil—fust her eyes and then her nose   poor thing  she do seem

to feel her loss dreadful ’



‘and well she may ’ said mrs  paddock emphatically   ‘a good husband same

as fiander bain’t to be picked up every day ’



‘why  he was but a old man ’ retorted the girl   ‘mrs  fiander’ll soon

have plenty o’ young chaps a comin’ to coort her  they d’ say as mr 

fiander have a left her every single penny he had  to do what she likes

wi’   she’ll soon take up wi’ some smart young fellow—it is n’t in natur’

to expect a handsome young body same as her to go on frettin’ for ever

after a old man  let him be so good as he may ’



‘nay now  nay now ’ cried mrs  belbin authoritatively  ‘’t will be this

way  as you’ll soon see   mr  fiander will ha’ left the widow his money

and farm and all  as long as she do be a widow  but if she goes for to

change her state  why then o’ coorse it’ll go to somebody else   there

never was a man livin’—and more particularly a old one—as could make up

his mind to leave his money behind him for a woman to spend on another

man   that’ll be it  ye’ll find   mrs  fiander’ll keep her money as long

as she d’ keep her mournin’ ’



‘here be master  now ’ announced her opposite neighbour  craning her head

a little further out of the doorway   ‘the poor man  he do look upset and

sorrowful ’



the eyes of all the little party fixed themselves on the approaching

figure   mr  sharpe was clad in sunday gear of prosperous broadcloth  and

wore  somewhat on the back of his head  a tall hat so antiquated as to

shape and so shaggy as to texture that the material of which it was

composed may possibly have been beaver   his large face was at that

moment absolutely devoid of all expression  mrs  paddock’s remark 

therefore  seemed to be dictated by a somewhat lively imagination   he

nodded absently as the women greeted him  which they did very

respectfully  as both their husbands worked under him  but wheeled round

after he had passed the group to address mrs  paddock 



‘i’ll take those chicken off you as you was a speakin’ on if you’ll fetch

’em up to my place to week   the fox have a took a lot of mine  and i be

loath to disappoint my customers ’



‘i’ll fetch ’em up  sir  so soon as i can   these be terrible times  mr 

sharpe  bain’t they   sich losses as we’ve a had last week   the fox he

’ve a been terrible mischeevous  and poor mr  fiander—he were took very

unexpected  were n’t he ’



‘ah ’ agreed mr  sharpe 



‘you’ll be the one to miss him  sir   as we was sayin’  mrs  belbin and

me  mr  sharpe ’ull be the one to miss him   ye did use to go there every

sunday reg’lar  mr  sharpe  did n’t ye ’



‘ah ’ agreed the farmer again   his large face seemed just as

expressionless as before  but a close observer might have detected a

sudden suffusion of colour to the eyelids 



‘they d’ say as mrs  fiander be takin’ on terrible ’ put in mrs  belbin 

folding her arms across her ample bosom  and settling herself for a good

chat with an air of melancholy enjoyment   ‘she is a nice young

woman—yes  she’s that  and the marriage did turn out wonderful well 

though folks did think it a bit foolish o’ mr  fiander to choose sich a

young maid at his time o’ life   but he was lonesome  poor man  losing

his first wife so long ago  and the children dying so young  and his

second missus bein’ took too   but  well  as i d’ say  the last marriage

turned out wonderful well  there was never a word said again’ mrs 

fiander ’



‘there was never a word  to  be said ’ returned mr  sharpe somewhat

sternly 



‘yes  just what i d’ say ’ chimed in mrs  paddock   ‘his ch’ice was a

good ’un   she be a nice body  mrs  fiander be ’



‘ah ’ agreed the farmer  ‘i d’ ’low she be a nice plain young woman   her

husband have a proved that he did think his ch’ice a good ’un  for he’ve

a left her everything as he had in the world ’



‘but not if she marries again  sir  sure ’ cried both the women together 



‘lard ’ added mrs  belbin  ‘he’d never ha’ been sich a sammy as to let

her keep everything if she goes for to take another man ’



‘she be left house and farm  stock and money  onconditional ’ returned

mr  sharpe emphatically   and he passed on  leaving the gossips aghast 







chapter ii





    the time i’ve lost in wooing 

    in watching and pursuing

          the light that lies

          in woman’s eyes 

    has been my heart’s undoing 



                                                             thomas moore 



the subject of the conversation recently recorded was slowly removing her

‘blacks ’ and laying them carefully away on the lavender scented shelves

in the desolate upper chamber of the home which had suddenly grown so

lonely   divested of the flowing mantle  the tall  well moulded figure

was set off by its close fitting black robe  and the face  which had been

hidden from view by the thick folds of crape  proved able to stand the

test of the glaring summer sunshine   the adjective ‘plain ’ applied to

the widow by her late husband’s friend  must be taken only in its local

sense as signifying ‘simple and straightforward ’ even to the indifferent

eyes of this elderly yeoman rosalie’s beauty had ripened and increased

during the four years that had elapsed since her marriage with his

friend   the black lashes which shaded her lovely eyes were still wet 

the red lips quivered  and the bosom heaved convulsively   most of the

friends and neighbours of the late mr  fiander would have been

astonished—not to say scandalised—at the sight of such grief   it was

quite decent and becoming to cry in church where everybody was looking at

you  but to cry when you were alone for an old man of sixty two—when you

had been left in undisputed possession of all his property  and might

with perfect impunity marry again at the earliest possible opportunity—it

was not only unreasonable and foolish  but rank ingratitude for the most

merciful dispensation of providence 



but mrs  fiander continued to sob to herself  and to look blankly round

the empty room  and out at the wide fields where the familiar figure had

been wont to roam  and when  taking the new widow’s cap from its box  she

arranged it on the top of her abundant hair  she could not repress a

fresh gush of tears 



‘poor fiander ’ she said to herself  ‘he would n’t let me wear it if he

knew   it makes me a perfect fright  and is so cumbersome and so much in

the way   but i’ll wear it all the same   nobody shall say i’m wanting in

respect to his memory   dear  dear  not a week gone yet   it seems more

like a year ’



she descended the stairs slowly  and entered the parlour   there was the

high backed chair where fiander used to sit waiting for the sunday midday

meal  there also was the stool on which he supported his gouty leg 

opposite was another chair  invariably occupied by farmer sharpe on

sunday afternoons  when  after a walk round his neighbour’s land  he came

in for a chat and a smoke   mrs  fiander herself had always sat at the

table  joining in the conversation from time to time  after she had mixed

for her husband and his friend the stiff glass of grog of which it was

their custom to partake   fiander said nobody mixed it so well as she 

and even mr  sharpe occasionally nodded approval  and generously agreed

that she was a first rate hand 



she wondered idly if mr  sharpe would come to day  she almost hoped he

would   she did not like to walk round the fields alone—people would

think it strange  too—and it was so lonely and so dreary sitting by

herself in the house 



but mr  sharpe’s chair remained empty all that afternoon  mrs  fiander 

however  had other visitors   it was getting near tea time  and she was

looking forward somewhat anxiously to the arrival of that meal which

would make a break in the dismal hours  when a genteel knock at the door

startled her   she knew it was not isaac  for it was his custom to walk

in uninvited  and thought it might be some other neighbour coming with a

word of comfort   she was surprised  however  when the maid ushered in a

tall  stout young man  whom she recognised as the son of one of the

leading tradespeople in the town   andrew burge’s father was  indeed  not

only cab and coach proprietor on a large scale  but also undertaker  and

rosalie now remembered that her actual visitor had taken a prominent part

at her husband’s funeral 



‘i jest called to see how you might be getting on  mrs  fiander ’ he

remarked  ‘and to offer my respectful condoliences   ’t was a melancholy

occasion where we met last  mrs  fiander ’



‘it was indeed ’ said rosalie  adding  somewhat stiffly  ‘take a seat 

mr  burge ’



mr  burge took a seat—not one of the ordinary chairs which mrs  fiander

indicated with a general wave of the hand  but poor elias’s own

particular one  which was  as has been stated  established in the

chimney corner   it happened to be directly opposite to the one in which

rosalie had been sitting—isaac sharpe’s usual chair—and was no doubt

chosen by the visitor on account of its agreeable proximity to his

hostess   anybody more unlike its former occupant it would be hard to

imagine   andrew was  as has been said  tall and stout  with black eyes 

closely resembling boot buttons in size and expression  a florid

complexion  and very sleek black hair   he conveyed a general impression

of bursting out of his clothes  his coat appearing to be too tight  his

trousers too short  his collar too high  and his hat  when he wore it 

too small   this hat he carefully placed upon the ground between his

legs  and drew from its crown a large white pocket handkerchief  which he

flourished almost in a professional manner 



‘i feels ’ he went on  attuning his voice to the melancholy tone in

harmony with this proceeding—‘i feels that any condoliences  let them be

so sincere as they may  falls immaterially short of the occasion   the

late mr  elias fiander was universally respected by the townsfolk of

branston as well as by his own immediate neighbours ’



‘you are very kind ’ said rosalie  feeling that she must make a remark 

and inwardly chiding herself for the frenzied impatience with which she

had longed to turn him out of her husband’s chair   after all  the poor

young man was unconscious of offence  and meant well 



‘it was  i may say  mrs  fiander  a object of congratulation to me that i

was able to pay the deceased a last melancholy tribute   p’r’aps you did

n’t chance to observe that it was me druv the ’earse ’



‘i knew i had seen you there ’ said the widow  in a low voice  ‘but i

could n’t for the moment recollect where ’



‘it would ha’ fallen in better wi’ my own wishes ’ went on andrew  ‘if i

could ha’ driven both o’ you   but my father told me you did n’t fancy

the notion o’ the jubilee ’earse ’



‘you mean that combined hearse and mourning coach ’ cried rosalie   ‘no 

indeed   why  the coffin is put crosswise behind the driver’s legs  just

like a bale of goods   i think it’s dreadful ’



‘nay now ’ returned andrew  ‘we are most careful to show every respect to

the pore corpse   the compartment is made special—glazed  and all quite

beautiful   some people thinks it a privilege for the mourners to be

sittin’ behind  so close to their dear departed   and then think of the

expense it saves—only one pair of horses needed  you know   not but what

expense is no object to  you   and of course  your feelin’s bein’ o’ that

delicate natur’  you felt  i suppose  it would be almost too ‘arrowing ’



‘i know i could n’t bear the idea ’ she cried   ‘the  jubilee  hearse  do

you call it   how came you to give it such a name ’



‘ah   why  you see  it was entirely my father’s idea  and he had it built

in the jubilee year   he thought  you know  he’d like to do something a

little special that year by way of showin’ his loyalty   ah  he spared no

expense in carryin’ of it out  i do assure ’ee   well  as i was sayin’ 

mrs  fiander  it would have been a great pleasure to me to have given you

both a token of respect and sympathy at the same time  but  since it was

n’t to be  i followed what i thought would be most in accordance with

your wishes  and i showed my respect for your feelin’s by driving the

remains ’



here he flourished the handkerchief again and raised the boot button eyes

to mrs  fiander’s face 



‘i am  of course  grateful for any tribute of respect to my dear

husband ’ she said 



‘yes ’ resumed mr  burge  ‘i thought you’d look on it in that light  but

i should have thought it a privilege to drive you  mrs  fiander ’



rosalie made some inarticulate rejoinder 



‘i thought i’d just call round and explain my motives ’ he went on  ‘and

also take the opportunity of offering in person my best condoliences ’



‘thank you ’ said rosalie 



‘i may speak  i think ’ remarked andrew pompously  ‘in the name of the

whole borough of branston   there was  i might say  but one mournful

murmur when the noos of his death came to town   but one mournful murmur 

i do assure ’ee  mrs  fiander ’



rosalie looked up gratefully  the young man certainly meant well and this

information was gratifying   she felt a little thrill of melancholy

pleasure at the thought of the universal esteem and respect in which her

poor elias had been held   but meeting the hard expressionless gaze of

mr  burge’s tight little eyes  the appreciative compliment died upon her

lips 



‘so now ’ resumed the visitor  diving for his hat and carefully tucking

away the handkerchief in its lining—‘now  mrs  fiander  having spoken for

myself and for my fellow townsmen  and having assured myself that you are

no worse in health than might have been expected under these extraneous

circumstances  i will withdraw ’



he rose  ducked his head  extended his hand  and solemnly pumped

rosalie’s up and down for about two minutes  finally backing to the door 



as he let himself out he almost fell over another caller who was at that

moment raising his hand to the knocker   this was a dapper gentleman of

about his own age  with an alert and sprightly air and a good humoured 

sharp featured face 



rosalie  just standing within the half open parlour door  caught sight of

the new comer and wondered who he might be   in a moment he had set her

doubts at rest 



‘good day  ma’am ’ he remarked  advancing cheerily with outstretched

hand   ‘i must introduce myself  i see  i’m not so well known to you as

you are to me   my name is cross—samuel cross—and i am one of mr 

robinson’s clerks   robinson and bradbury  solicitors  you know—that’s

who i am   i just called round to—to make a few remarks with regard to

certain business matters in the hands of our firm ’



‘won’t you sit down ’ said rosalie  hastily taking possession of her

husband’s chair   it should not  if she could help it  again be

desecrated that day   she pointed out a small one  but mr  samuel cross 

without noticing the intimation  stepped quickly forward and seated

himself opposite to the widow in the chair she had just vacated—isaac

sharpe’s chair   rosalie contemplated him with knitted brows  since mr 

sharpe  that trusted friend  had not thought fit to occupy his customary

place himself that afternoon  she felt ill pleased at the intrusion of

this presumptuous stranger 



what a callow little shrimp of a man it was  to be sure  and how unlike 

with his spare form and small narrow face—a face which she mentally

compared to that of a weasel—to the large  bland personality of isaac 



‘a matter of business ’ she said drily   ‘i am surprised that mr 

robinson should send you on sunday ’



‘oh  this is quite an informal visit  mrs  fiander  not at all official 

i came of my own accord—i may say  in my private capacity   this here is

n’t a six and eightpenny affair   he  he ’



‘oh ’ said rosalie  even more drily than before 



‘no  seeing  mrs  fiander  that you are left so peculiarly lonely and

desolate  i just thought to myself that it would be only kind to call in

in passing and mention that your business matters  mrs  fiander  are in a

most satisfactory position   i have frequently heard our firm remark that

they seldom had to deal with affairs more satisfactory and

straightforward ’



‘my husband had a very clear head for business ’ said mrs  fiander   ‘i

always found that ’



‘’t is n’t that alone ’ rejoined the young man  ‘it is  if i may be

permitted to express an opinion  the very satisfactory manner in which he

has disposed of his property  on which i feel bound to congratulate you 

i called round  private as i say  jist to let you know as all was most

satisfactory ’



‘thank you   i had no doubt about it ’ said rosalie  surveying her

visitor with increasing disfavour as he leered at her from the depth of

isaac’s capacious chair 



‘ladies ’ he pursued  with an ingratiating wriggle—‘ladies is apt to be

easily alarmed when legal matters is under discussion   the very terms

which come so natural to us are apt to frighten them   lor’ bless you  i

des say when mr  robinson do talk about testamentary dispositions and

such like it makes you feel quite nervous   but ’t is only the sound of

the words as is strange  the thing itself  meaning the testamentary

dispositions of the late lamented mr  fiander  is  i do assure you  most

satisfactory   what with the freehold property  meanin’ the farm and the

money invested in such good and safe securities—you may be sure that they

are good and safe  mrs  fiander  for i may ventur’ to tell you in

confidence that the late lamented used to consult our firm with regard to

his investments—i have pleasure in assuring you that very few ladies find

theirselves in so satisfactory a position as you do find yourself to day 

i jist dropped in  unofficial like  to let you know this  for  as i said

to myself  it may be a satisfaction to pore mrs  fiander to know  her 

circumstances  and to understand that  desolate as she may be left  there

is some compensations  and that  moreover  she has been left absolutely

free and independent  the late lamented not having hampered her by no

conditions whatever ’



here mr  cross  who had been leaning forward in his chair so that his

face  with its narrow jaws and its little twinkling eyes  had been a good

deal below the level of the slightly disdainful countenance of his

hostess  now slowly straightened himself  clapped an exultant hand on

either knee  and brought the jaws aforesaid together with a snap 



mrs  fiander could not help contrasting him once more with the friend who

should by right be sitting opposite to her  how far more welcome would

have been the sight of the good tempered rubicund visage  the placid

portly form   even the contented  amicable taciturnity which mr  sharpe

usually maintained during the greater part of his visits would have been

far more to her mind than this loquacity  which somehow seemed

unpleasantly near familiarity   still  it was unreasonable to take a

dislike to the poor young man merely because he looked like a weasel and

was disposed to be a little over friendly  no doubt his intention was

kind 



she thanked him  therefore  with somewhat forced politeness  but could

not repress a little forward movement in her chair which a sensitive

person would have recognized as a token of dismissal   mr  cross was not 

however  of this calibre  and prolonged his visit until his hostess’s

patience fairly wore out   she rose at last  glancing at the clock  and

observing that she thought it was time to get ready for evening church 



‘i will have the pleasure of escorting you ’ announced samuel promptly

and cheerfully 



thereupon mrs  fiander sat down again 



‘on second thoughts i’m too tired ’ she said  ‘but i will not allow you

to delay any longer  mr  cross—you will certainly be late as it is ’



he had no course but to withdraw then  which he did  unwillingly enough 

after tenderly pressing the widow’s hand and assuring her  quite

superfluously  that she might depend on him to look after her interests

in every way in his power 



rosalie was disconsolately polishing the hand which had received this

undesired token of interest  when the door creaked slowly open  and a

tall  gaunt  elderly female  clad in rusty black  and wearing somewhat on

the back of her head a flat black bonnet  with the strings untied 

entered the room   this was mrs  greene  a personage generally to be met

with in this neighbourhood in households whose number had recently been

either increased or diminished   she was equally at home  as she once

remarked  with babies and with corpses  and she filled up the intervals

by ‘charing ’  her appearance was so genteel  and her manner of

fulfilling her various duties so elegant  that the clergyman’s daughter

had once remarked that she was wonderfully refined for a char woman  the

appellation had stuck to her  and she was commonly known as the ‘refined

char woman’ among such of the ‘gentry’ as occasionally employed her in

that capacity 



she had come to littlecomb farm to ‘lay out’ poor elias fiander  and she

was remaining on as chief factotum and comforter   for it was n’t to be

supposed that the poor young widow ’ud be eq’al to lookin’ after the

maids—much less to turn her thoughts to doin’ for herself   she now

advanced slowly to the table  and after heaving a deep sigh proceeded to

lay the cloth   rosalie knew that she was burning to enter into

conversation  but was too much dispirited to encourage her   but

by and by  after a preliminary cough  mrs  greene remarked in a

lugubrious tone 



‘that’s a lovely cap  mum   everybody was a sayin’ that you did look

charmin’ in your weeds   ay  that was what they said   “she do look

charming”—that was the very thing they said  “’t is a comfort  too ” says

they  “to see how nice she do mourn for mr  fiander ”  they was all

a passing the remark one to the other about it  mum—admirable they said

it was ’



‘nonsense ’ cried rosalie wrathfully  but with a little quaver in her

voice  ‘it would be very strange  i think  if i did not grieve for such a

good husband   i wish people would n’t talk about me ’ she added

petulantly 



‘talk ’ ejaculated mrs  greene dismally   ‘ah  they will talk  mum  you

may depend on it   they’ll al’ays talk  and perticlarly about a young

widow   lord  how they did go on about me when poor greene died   they

did n’t leave so much as my furnitur’ alone   whether i could afford to

keep it  or whether i’d be for ridden house and goin’ into lodgin’s  and

whether i’d put the children in an orphanage and get married again—it was

enough to drive a body silly the way they did go on ’



‘disgusting ’ cried rosalie  now faintly interested   ‘the idea of

talking of a second marriage when your poor husband was only just dead ’



‘why  that be the first thing they’d talk on ’ with a kind of dismal

triumph—‘more perticlar if a woman be young and good lookin’   in your

own case  mum  i do assure ye they be all a pickin’ out  your  second 

ah  that’s what they be a doin’  but as they all picks different men they

don’t so very well agree ’



‘mrs  greene ’ ejaculated her mistress indignantly  wheeling round in her

chair  ‘what do you mean   how dare you come and repeat such things to

me—it’s positively indecent ’



‘that be the very remark as i did pass myself to the men yesterday ’

retorted mrs  greene  pausing to contemplate mrs  fiander with her hands

upon her hips   ‘the very thing   “’t is most onbecomin’ ” says i  “to be

settin’ yourselves up to pry into the affairs o’ your betters   missus ”

says i  “be a thinkin’ of nothing but her mournin’ so far  and when she

do make her ch’ice ” says i  “she’ll please herself and pick out him as

is most suitable ”  them was my words  mum ’



‘well ’ cried rosalie  rising to her feet impetuously  ‘i wonder you dare

to own them to me  mrs  greene   i think that  considering you are a

widow yourself  you ought to know better than to accuse another woman of

such faithlessness   if you think i could ever  ever forget my good kind

husband  you are much mistaken ’



mrs  greene coughed drily behind her hand 



‘why should i marry again any more than you ’ cried rosalie  with angry

tears starting to her eyes 



‘well  mum  the cases be very different   nobody never axed i—’t was n’t

very likely as they should  considering i had six children and only my

own labour to keep ’em   as for you  mum  nobody could n’t think it at

all strange if you was to get married again—considerin’ everything  you

know   your station in life ’ continued mrs  greene delicately  ‘and your

not bein’ blessed with no children  and your fortun’ and your  oncommon 

looks—it ’ud be very strange if there was n’t a many a coming coortin’

ye—and you may depend upon it they will ’ she cried with conviction 

‘and seein’ how young you be  mum  and how lonesome like  i should say it

be a’most your dooty to take a second ’



‘now listen to me  mrs  greene ’ said rosalie very emphatically  ‘i wish

to put an end to this foolish gossip at once   you can tell everybody

that you hear talking about the matter that i never intend to marry

again   never —do you hear me ’



‘yes  mum ’ returned mrs  greene  with every feature and line of her

countenance expressing disbelief  ‘i hear   p’r’aps i better begin by

lettin’ them two chaps know what called here to day   i do ’low they’ll

be disapp’inted ’



‘i wish you would n’t talk such nonsense  mrs  greene ’ cried rosalie

almost pettishly  though the colour rushed over her face  and a startled

expression showed itself for a moment in her heavy eyes   ‘go away   i

don’t want to be worried any more  remember what i have said  that’s

all ’







chapter iii





    nothing coming  nothing going—

    landrail craking  one cock crowing 

    few things moving up and down 

          all things drowsy 



                                                       north country song 



rosalie passed a very unquiet night  and woke from a troubled sleep

shortly after dawn   the dead weight of grief  ever present to her since

her bereavement  was now  as she dimly felt  supplemented by something

else—something irritating  something unpleasant   as her scattered

faculties returned to her she gradually recognised that this state of

feeling was produced by several small causes   the two visits which she

had received yesterday  and which she had supposed to proceed from mere

officious goodwill  had  as she now acknowledged  been prompted in all

probability by aspirations as unjustifiable as they were unseemly   her

subsequent interview with mrs  greene had disagreeably enlightened her on

this point  and had also made her aware of the kind of gossip to which

she must expect to be subjected   then—all through that long  lonely 

heavy day isaac sharpe had not once put in an appearance   he  her

husband’s faithful friend  the only real friend whom she herself

acknowledged  had not thought fit to look in for so much as five minutes

to cheer her in her desolation   as she thought of these things hot tears

welled afresh to her eyes   oh  how desolate she was   no one really

cared for her  and  what was almost worse  no one seemed to believe in

the sincerity of her affliction 



as she lay tossing uneasily on her pillow  and as the light grew and

brightened  and the birds’ jubilant songs mingled with the distant lowing

of cows  a new sense of disquietude came to her  proceeding from a

different and very tangible cause   it was broad day—monday morning—a

morning of exceptional importance at the farm—and no human being seemed

yet to be afoot   reaching up her hand to the old fashioned watch pocket

which hung in the centre of the bed  she took down elias’s heavy silver

repeater and pressed the spring    ting    ting    ting    ting    ting  

five o’clock   sitting up  she sent the two cases flying open and gazed

almost incredulously at the dial beneath   ten minutes past five—no less 

she sprang out of bed and flung open her door 



‘jane   susan   what are you about  ’t is past five o’clock  and churning

morning   how did you come to oversleep yourselves like that ’



there was a muffled murmur  a thud upon the floor  a  pat    pat  of bare

feet across the room above  and a door overhead opened 



‘was ye callin’  mum ’



‘was i calling   i should think i was calling   have you forgotten what

morning it is ’



‘nay  missus  that i haven’t   lord  no   ’t was this day se’ennight as

poor master was buried   dear  yes  so ’t was ’



a lump rose in rosalie’s throat  but she steadied her voice and said

coldly 



‘i am not talking of that   it is churning morning  as you know very

well   you should have been up and about an hour ago   make as much haste

as you can  now  and come down ’



she closed the door with just sufficient noise to indicate the condition

of her feelings  and hastened across the room to the open window 

drawing the curtains apart  she looked out   a glorious summer’s day 

not a cloud upon the pearly blue expanse of sky  the leaves stirring

gently in a fresh breeze—a breeze laden with all the exquisite spicy

scents of morning  the fragrance of dewy grasses  of sun kissed trees  of

newly awakened flowers   the monthly rose tree climbing round her

mullioned window thrust its delicate clusters of bloom almost into

rosalie’s face  but she pushed it impatiently aside   her eyes cast a

keen glance on the homely scene beyond   above the time worn roofs of the

farm buildings  where the green of the moss and the mellow red and yellow

of the tiles were alike transfigured by this mystic glow  she could see

last year’s ricks shouldering each other  their regular outlines defined 

as it were  with a pencil of fire  the great meadow beyond  which sloped

downwards till it reached the church yard wall a quarter of a mile away 

broke into light ripples  tawny and russet  as the breeze swept over it 



surely these were sights to gladden a young heart—even a heart that had

been sorrowing—yet the expression of rosalie’s eyes grew more and more

discontented and displeased  and a frown gathered on her brow 



the fowl were flocking impatiently about the gate of the great barn yard 

yonder  on the further side  from beneath the tiled roof of the line of

pigsties she could hear loud vociferations  turning her eyes towards the

stable buildings which ran at right angles to them  she could see that

the doors were fast closed  and could hear the rattling of chains and

stamping of heavy hoofs within   the church meadow ought to have been cut

to day—the grass was over ripe as it was  men and horses should have been

at work since three o’clock   no figures appeared even in the

neighbourhood of the barn  and looking beyond to the barton proper  she

could see that it was empty   no wonder that the lowing of the cows had

sounded distant in her ears  they were still in their pasture by the

river   poor creatures  crowding round the gate  no doubt  as the fowl

were doing close at hand  all clamouring alike for the attention which

was evidently withheld from them   what was everyone about   why had not

the men come to their work as usual 



she performed her toilet hastily and somewhat perfunctorily  and when at

last a sleepy looking red haired man came slouching up the lane which led

to the farm  he was surprised to see a figure in rustling print and

broad brimmed chip hat standing in the midst of a bevy of cocks and hens 

scattering handfuls of grain with wide impetuous sweeps of a round 

vigorous arm 



‘hallo   what’s the hurry  sukey ’ he inquired pleasantly 



but the face which was flashed upon him was not the rosy and somewhat

vacant one of susan  but belonged to no less a person than missus

herself 



‘what’s the hurry  job ’ she repeated severely   ‘i should like to know

why there is n’t a little more hurry   what has become of all the men 

has anybody gone to fetch the cows   what is everyone about  i say ’



job tilted his hat a little sideways on his red locks  the better to

scratch his head  and gazed at his mistress with a puzzled and somewhat

scandalised expression 



‘ye must expect things to be a bit onreg’lar for a bit  mum ’ he

remarked   ‘seein’ the loss we’ve had  and us all bein’ so upset like

about poor master  we ha’n’t a got the ’eart to go about our work as if

nothin’ had happened   it bain’t to be looked for   nay now ’ he

continued mildly  ‘an’ we did n’t look to find yerself a goin’ about this

way—we did n’t  sure   it scarce seems nait’ral   if i may make so bold

as to say so  it do seem’—here job fixed an expostulatory glance on the

angry young face that was confronting him—‘it d’ seem scarce right  mum ’



‘job hunt ’ returned his mistress haughtily  ‘you are not called upon to

make remarks upon my actions  but i will tell you so much  it is my duty

to see that the work in this place is properly done  and i intend that it

shall be properly done   go and call the other men at once   tell them if

they are ever again so disgracefully late they shall all be fined   call

them quickly ’ she added with an imperative tap of the foot  ‘and then go

and fetch the cows ’



as she turned to re enter the house she caught sight of susan  who was

evidently exchanging astonished and depreciatory grimaces with job  while

mrs  greene  in the background  was raising hands and eyes to heaven 



‘come  get to work ’ she cried sharply   ‘skim the cream  susan  and you 

jane  get the churn ready   well  mrs  greene  what are you staring at 

have you never seen me work before  that the fact of my turning up my

sleeves need astonish you so much   i suppose you can find something to

do about the house   give me that other skimmer  jane ’



‘ho dear  yes  mum  i can find a plenty to do about this here house   i

wur but a lookin’ at you  mum  because it do really seem a’most too much

for flesh an’ blood to be a takin’ on itself as you be a takin’ on

yourself now  mum   dear  yes  but it’s to be hoped as ye won’t overtax

your constitootion  mrs  fiander ’



‘go and clean the kitchen grate ’ said rosalie  beginning to skim with

great rapidity and decision  ‘and see that you blacklead it properly ’



‘ho yes  mum   i’ll  blacklead it ’ returned the elder matron  without 

however  attempting to move from the spot where she stood  and continuing

to fix her eyes mournfully on her mistress—‘ i’ll  blacklead it right

enough ’ she repeated  with a kind of groan  after a pause  during which

she had meditatively polished first one skinny bare arm and then the

other with a not over clean apron 



‘well  why in heaven’s name don’t you go  then ’ cried rosalie

impatiently  for she felt mrs  greene’s sorrowfully disapproving gaze

right at the back of her head 



‘i be going  mum  i be going   if i mid take the liberty of remindin’

you  mum—’t is your  hat  as you’ve a got on your head ’



‘well ’ inquired rosalie  reddening ominously 



‘well  mrs  fiander ’ returned the char woman with an insinuating smile 

‘would n’t you like me to run upstairs wi’ it now and fetch you down your

cap ’



‘no ’ replied her mistress very shortly  ‘if i had wished for it i should

have sent for it   you need not be so officious   the strings would get

in my way while i worked ’ she added a little inconsequently   she felt

she was lowering herself by making this explanation  yet she could not

bear that even mrs  greene and the two maids should think her wanting in

respect to elias’s memory 



mrs  greene withdrew  murmuring under her breath that it was to be ’oped

as nobody would n’t chance t’ look in that morning  which was not 

indeed  very likely  the hands of the old fashioned clock in the kitchen

beyond just pointing to the quarter past six 



for some minutes nothing was heard but the clinking of the skimmers

against the sides of the vats as the rich cream  clotted and crinkled and

thick  was removed therefrom   the scene was a pretty one  indeed  such a

dairy on such a summer’s morning must always hold a charm and a

picturesqueness of its own  and now that the angular presence of mrs 

greene was removed there was absolutely no discordant element in this

cool harmony   the dairy itself was a wide  pleasant room  its buff walls

and red flagged floor throwing out the exquisite tints of the vast tracts

of cream  each marked off by its own barrier of glancing tin  and varying

in tone from the deep yellow of that portion destined for the morning’s

churning to the warm white of the foaming pailfuls which job poured from

time to time somewhat sulkily into the vat nearest the door   then there

was the green of the gently swaying boughs without  seen through windows

and open door  the brilliant patch of sunlight creeping over the uneven

threshold  the glint of blue sky between sunlit green and sunlit stone 

the brave array of glittering cans on the topmost shelf added their own

share of brightness  the great earthenware crocks and pans  some the very

colour of the cream itself  some ruddy in tone  some of a deep rich

brown  lent also valuable aid  then there were tall white jars containing

lard  carefully packed baskets and smooth wooden vessels piled high with

eggs  little squares of filmy gauze hung out on lines in readiness for

the golden rolls of butter which they were soon to enfold   the figures

of the girls themselves—for the mistress of littlecomb farm was no more

than a girl in years—gave the necessary and very delightful touch of

human interest   susan and jane  in cotton dresses and large aprons so

immaculate that the mere sight of them was sufficient to recall that it

was the first day of the week  were not without a certain rustic charm of

their own  as for rosalie  standing in the foreground  with her sleeves

rolled up on her white arms  her print dress fitting so closely to her

beautiful form  the hair hastily rolled up escaping into such exquisite

curls and tendrils round brow and ear and shapely neck—rosalie was as

ever what her admiring old elias had once called her—the leading article 



when the churn was fairly at work  the skim milk duly meted out to the

pigs  and the long procession of dairy cows were sauntering back to their

pasture under the guardianship of job and the three ‘chaps’ who had till

then been busily milking  rosalie removed her hat and sat down to

breakfast 



the flush of annoyance still lingered on her face  and  while she ate 

her glance wandered through the window to the premises without   she

could hear robert cross and james bundy leisurely leading out the horses 

inducing them with many objurgations to stand while they were being

harnessed to the rattling  creaking mower   how slow they were   they

should have been in the field hours ago  and yet they slouched about as

though the beautiful golden morning were not already half over   now  at

last they were starting—no  here was james coming back for something they

had forgotten   rising hastily from her chair  she leaned out of the open

window  tapping impatiently on the pane   ‘what are you about  bundy 

why on earth don’t you try and make a little more haste ’



‘mum ’ gasped bundy  turning round a vacant  weather beaten countenance

adorned with the smallest fraction of a nose which it was possible for

the face of man to possess 



‘i say  why don’t you make more haste when you have lost so much time

already ’



‘i be making so much haste as ever i can ’ responded james  much

aggrieved   ‘i be just a comin’ to fetch the ile can   ’t would n’t be no

use to get to work without the ile can ’



‘why did n’t you think about the oil can while cross was harnessing the

horses  ’t is nearly eight o’clock—you have lost half your morning’s

work ’



bundy looked up at the sky  then  still in an aggrieved manner  at his

mistress 



‘we was all so upset ’ he was beginning  when she interrupted him

fiercely 



‘don’t let me hear another word about your being upset   if i can attend

to my business  you can attend to yours  i should think   ’t is but an

excuse for disgraceful laziness ’



‘we  was  upset ’ asserted bundy with much dignity  ‘and  as for bein’

behind  if it comes to that we can keep on workin’ a bit later this

a’ternoon ’



‘you must certainly work later this afternoon  but how long will this

fine weather last  think you   besides  you know as well as i do that it

is much better for the horses to work in the early morning   there  get

started now  and try to make up for lost time ’



she returned to her breakfast  and james rejoined his companion at a

slightly accelerated pace   but  by and by  her attention was caught by

the sound of voices  apparently in placid conversation   back to the

window again flew she  the village carpenter  who was supposed to be

repairing the yard gate  had just arrived  and was leaning negligently

against one of the posts  while abel hunt  job’s brother  a large bucket

of pig food in either hand  was leisurely talking to him 



‘i will give them a few minutes ’ said rosalie to herself   ‘after all  i

must n’t be too hard on them ’



once more she went back to the table  finished her egg  and drank her

second cup of tea  the trickle of talk meanwhile continuing without

ceasing 



pushing back her chair  she returned to the window impatiently   the

carpenter had remained in the same attitude  without even unfastening his

bag of tools  abel had set down his pails  and propped himself up against

the other gate post  the pigs were wildly protesting in the background 



rosalie recrossed the room hastily and went to the door 



‘do you intend to gossip here all day ’ she inquired with flashing eyes 



‘we was jest a talkin’ about the melancolly event ’ explained the

carpenter 



‘you will oblige me ’ said rosalie  ‘by keeping to your work   abel  take

those pails across to the sties at once   remember  i will have no more

dawdling ’



abel took up his pails  and the carpenter unfastened his tools  the

expression of both faces alike shocked  wounded  and astonished 



‘if this goes on ’ murmured rosalie to herself  ‘i shall not only break

my heart  but go out of my mind   oh  elias  you were clever as well as

kind—everything seemed to go by clock work when you were here—oh  why did

you leave me ’







chapter iv





    an’ o’ worken’ days  oh  he do wear

    such a funny roun’ hat —you mid know’t—

    wi’ a brim all a strout roun’ his hair 

    an’ his glissenèn eyes down below’t 

    an’ a coat wi’ broad skirts that do vlee

    in the wind ov his walk  round his knee 



                                                           william barnes 



all the forenoon was passed in butter making  and in the afternoon

rosalie betook herself to the mead to superintend the operations of james

and robert   it was not until after tea that she had leisure to change

her dress and make her way  by the well known little footpath that

skirted the cornfields and wound across the downs  to isaac sharpe’s

farm 



she found that worthy standing contemplatively in the middle of his yard 

there had been sheep shearing that day  and the master had worked as hard

as any of the men  now  however  the naked  ungainly looking ewes had

returned to their pasture  the newly taken fleeces lay neatly piled up in

a corner of the barn  and isaac was at liberty to straighten his weary

back  relax his muscles  and smoke the pipe of peace 



tall  massive  and imposing was this figure of his  ever at its best in

the smock frock and serviceable corduroys and leggings of weekday wear 

his wideawake  turned up at the back and projecting in front in the

orthodox shovel form  was decidedly more becoming than the sunday beaver 

he started as the yard gate creaked upon its hinges  and rosalie’s

black robed figure passed through 



‘why  mrs  fiander ’ he cried  hastening towards her  ‘be this you   i’m

glad to see ye   is there anything i can do for ’ee ’



rosalie could hardly have defined the motive which prompted her visit 

her desolate heart felt the need of sympathy  in this strange new life of

hers she yearned to find herself once more  if but for a moment  in touch

with the past   ‘no  mr  sharpe ’ she said with a little gasp  ‘i don’t

think there’s anything you can do for me   i only came because i—i—oh 

mr  sharpe  everything is going wrong ’



isaac sharpe took out his pipe and opened his eyes very wide 



‘come ’ he said  ‘come—tell me what be the matter ’



‘everything’s the matter ’ returned the widow in a shaking voice   ‘oh 

isaac  i can’t get on without elias ’



‘can’t ’ee now  my dear ’ returned isaac  blinking very hard   ‘well  i’m

sure ’t is nat’ral ’



rosalie gave a little sob  and the farmer  stretching out a large brown

hand  patted her arm soothingly 



‘don’t ’ee take on  though ’ he said   ‘nay now  don’t ’ee take on  my

dear   cryin’ never did nobody no good ’



‘i’m so lonely ’ went on the girl brokenly   ‘i miss him at every turn ’



‘ye’d be like to do that ’ responded sharpe judicially   ‘dear  yes—ye’d

be like to do that ’



‘everything is at sixes and sevens ’ she pursued plaintively   ‘the men

think they can do just as they like  it was eight o’clock before they

began their mowing this morning ’



‘well  i never ’ ejaculated isaac   ‘eight o’clock   what be the world

comin’ to ’



‘the very maids won’t get up ’ continued rosalie   ‘this was churning

morning  and it was after five before anybody moved   none of the men

came near the place until six  the cows were left in the pasture  none of

the beasts were fed ’



‘shockin’  shockin’ ’ commented the farmer   ‘dear heart alive   i never

heard o’ sich doin’s ’



‘when i speak to them ’ cried rosalie  her voice rising with the

recollection of her wrongs  ‘they turn round and tell me they are all too

much upset to think of work ’



‘do they now ’ in tones of deep disgust   ‘well  an’ that’s a pretty

story ’



‘yes   and you know  mr  sharpe  ’t is the last thing elias would have

wished—that the work should be neglected and everything allowed to go

wrong like this  yet they seem to think me heartless for expecting things

to go on as before   and the worst of it all is’—here poor rosalie began

to weep hysterically—‘they don’t any of them believe that i am sorry for

elias  and they think i’m going to marry again  and  and—two hateful 

odious  impudent young men have already come to court me ’



her sobs well nigh choked her as she made this last announcement  and

isaac  full of concern  fell to patting her arm again 



‘don’t ’ee now  my dear  don’t ’ee   well  ’t is very annoyin’ for ’ee 

i’m sure   there  don’t ’ee cry so   well  well  to think on’t   started

coortin’ a’ready  have they   well  they mid ha’ waited a bit   but come

in a minute  do ’ee  mrs  fiander  and sit ’ee down   dear heart alive 

dear heart alive  poor elias ’ud be terrible upset if he were to see ye

a givin’ way like this ’



he half persuaded  half propelled the still weeping widow across the yard

and into his kitchen  where  sitting down near the table and covering her

face with her hands under the heavy crape veil  she continued to sob

until her host was nearly distracted 



‘here  my dear  take a sup o’ this  ’t will do ye good ’



rosalie threw back her veil and took the glass which he offered her 

raising it to her lips  she found that the dark decoction which it

contained was excessively strong  unusually acid  and unspeakably nasty 

fresh tears  not prompted by sorrow this time  started to her eyes as she

set down the glass 



‘thank you  mr  sharpe ’ she said  ‘i am better now   i don’t think i’ll

finish it   it seems very strong ’



‘ah  it’s that ’ agreed the farmer with some pride   ‘sloe wine bithey d’

call it  she do make a quart every year   wonderful good for the spasms 

or sich like   she do get taken that way sometimes in her in’ards  pore

old soul  an’ she says a drop o’ this do al’ays set her to rights   sloe

wine  ah  that’s what it be called  ye’d scarce think ’twere made o’

nought but the snags what grows in the hedges—jist snags an’ a trifle o’

sugar   but i do assure ye ’t is that strong ’t will sometimes lift the

cork out o’ the bottle   now  mrs  fiander  ye’d best finish it  ’t is a

pity to let the good stuff go to waste ’



but  as rosalie gratefully but firmly declined  the worthy man appeased

his thrifty conscience by draining the glass himself 



‘well now  mrs  fiander ’ he resumed  as he set it down  ‘i be trewly

sorry that ye be so vexed an’ ann’yed wi’ the men comin’ so late  but  if

i may advise ’ee  be a bit stiff wi’ ’em  don’t ’ee let ’em fancy they

can impose upon ’ee because ye be a woman ’



‘i assure you  mr  sharpe  i showed them very plainly that i was vexed

this morning   i spoke as severely as i could ’



‘lard  my dear  them chaps don’t care for words  more pertic’lar a

woman’s words   bless you  they’ve all got women folks o’ their own  an’

they be well used to scoldin’   ’t is different wi’ us men  when we be

angry we can  dang  here and there  and use a bit o’ language   then  d’

ye see ’ said isaac  leaning forward confidentially  ‘the chaps

understand as we be in earnest  but ’t ’ud be no manner o’ good your

tryin’ to do that  my dear  ’t would n’t come nat’ral to ’ee  and they

would n’t think a bit the better of ’ee for it   nay  nay ’ he repeated

mournfully  ‘they wouldn’t think the better of ’ee ’



a faint smile hovered round rosalie’s lips  but isaac remained quite

serious 



‘a woman must show by her deeds that she be in earnest ’ he went on after

a pause   ‘’t is the only way  my dear   deeds and not words for a

woman ’



here he paused again  shaking his head reflectively   it was possible

that his thoughts had travelled back to that memorable box in which his

erring father had enshrined the riven locks that testified to his own

transgressions and the vigorous retaliation of his wife   isaac’s late

mother had certainly been a woman of action 



‘that’s it  my dear ’ repeated sharpe  emerging from his reverie  ‘ye’ll

be forced to turn to deeds   next time them chaps comes late  jist you up

an’ fine them   says you  “short work desarves short pay   bear in mind ”

says you  “that accordin’ to the work shall be the wage ”’



‘yes  i might try that ’ agreed rosalie   ‘but the worst of it is they

lose so much time and do their work so badly when they do come ’



‘then  jist make a’ example o’ one o’ them—that’s your best plan   give

the worst o’ them the sack  and ye’ll find the others ’ull settle down

like—like lambs ’ said the sheep farmer  bringing out the simile

triumphantly 



‘thank you very much for your advice  mr  sharpe   i’ll take it   and

now—’ she paused a moment  blushing—‘what would you recommend me to do

with regard to my other difficulty   how am i to make people understand

that i don’t mean to marry again ’



‘well  a body ’ud really think they need n’t be so pushin’ ’ remarked

isaac   ‘it be downright ondacent for ’em to be a hangin’ about ’ee so

soon—’



‘they have no business to think of it at all  mr  sharpe ’ interrupted

the widow fiercely   ‘i shall never   never  put anyone in my dear

elias’s place ’



‘that’s very well said  my dear ’ returned isaac  looking at her with

real kindness and emotion   ‘’t is the proper spirit   i myself  as you

may have heard me say  was never one to set up for wedlock   well  ye’ve

had a husband  and a good ’un  an’ you be in the right o’t to be

satisfied wi’ that  just as i be satisfied wi’ havin’ no wife at all 

dear heart alive  when i were a young chap the maids did use to be

castin’ their eyes at me  but i never took no notice  and when i grew

more staid there was one very perseverin’ woman  i do mind—very

perseverin’ she were   ah  she come to house here  time and again  wi’

one excuse or another  and at last  so soon as i did see her comin’ i did

use to shut door in her face ’



‘why  that’s what i shall do ’ cried rosalie  laughing  and clapping her

hands—‘that’s the very thing i shall do   thank you for the hint  mr 

sharpe   that again  you see  will be deeds  not words ’



isaac looked kindly at the bright face and sparkling eyes  and nodded

cheerfully 



‘that be the way to take ’em ’



‘i only wish i had thought of it on sunday ’ she went on   ‘those two men

sat and talked so long  that i was wishing them anywhere   i expected you

on sunday  mr  sharpe ’ she added  in an altered voice  while the smile

vanished from her face 



‘did ’ee ’ said isaac  abashed  and guilty 



‘yes  i did  indeed—i thought you would have come if only in memory of

old times ’



‘why  to tell the trewth  i could n’t a bear to go nigh the place ’

blurted out the farmer   ‘nay  nay—i’ve been a goin’ to littlecomb farm

sunday after sunday for nigh upon five and twenty year   i don’t know how

you could expect me  mrs  fiander  to go there now as he be gone ’



he wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his smock frock  and at this tribute

to elias’s memory his widow forgave the gruffness of isaac’s tone  and

almost  but not quite  the slight to herself 



she gazed at him for a moment in silence with a quivering lip  and he

wiped his eyes again and heaved a sigh 



‘you do not think of me at all ’ said rosalie  at last   ‘you don’t

consider my loneliness  or what i feel when i sit there  looking at the

two empty chairs  and thinking of how i used to sit between you  and how

happy we used to be   is n’t it worse for me to see his empty place than

you   you might have come—even if it did hurt you—you might have come to

bring me a word of comfort   i think you were very unkind  mr  sharpe ’



‘don’t ’ee now  my dear ’ stammered isaac  almost purple in the face  and

with his usually keen eyes suffused with tears   ‘i do really feel

touched to the ’eart when you look at me so pitiful and say such things 

god knows i’d be main glad to comfort you  but what can the likes of i

do ’



‘you could let me feel that i had still a friend ’ sobbed rosalie   ‘you

might come and sit in your old chair  and we could—we could talk about

elias ’



‘that’s trew  so we could ’ agreed isaac in a choked voice   ‘well  next

sunday—if i live so long—i’ll not let nothing hinder me   i’ll come  my

dear   i d’ ’low i should ha’ thought of you yesterday  but i could n’t

seem to think o’ nothing but how ’lias war n’t there ’



‘well  i shall be very glad to see you ’ said rosalie  rising  and

tremulously beginning to pull down her veil   ‘and i am very grateful for

your kindness   perhaps ’ she added hesitatingly  ‘you might be able to

look in one day during the week ’



‘nay ’ returned the farmer  ‘nay  mrs  fiander  not before sunday   i be

very busy to week—we be shearin’  d’ ye see  and there’s the big mead to

be cut   nay—not before sunday ’



‘oh  very well ’ she responded a little stiffly  and she went out of the

house and across the yard without speaking again except to say good bye

at the gate 



the downs were now all bathed with the light of the sinking sun  and the

topmost branches of the hedges which bordered the cornfields seemed

turned to gold  while the banks beneath had begun already to assume the

deeper tint that spoke of gathering dew—dew that the morning light would

turn to a very sheet of silver  but rosalie could only see the beauties

of the world without through a mist of crape and tears 



‘i have not a friend in the world ’ she said to herself  ‘not one   isaac

would n’t even take the trouble to walk a quarter of a mile to see how i

was getting on after following his advice   he is only coming on sunday

as a sort of duty  not because he wants to   well  never mind  i will

show him and everyone that i can look after myself   i want nobody’s

pretended pity since nobody really cares ’



and she held up her head beneath its heavy veil  and went on her way with

a stately carriage and a firm step 







chapter v





                                        he drow’d

    hizzelf about  an’ teäv’d an’ blow’d 

    lik’ any uptied calf 

                    

    an’ mutter’d out sich dreats  an’ wrung

    his vist up sich a size 



                                                           william barnes 



on the next morning when the men came slowly sauntering to their work

they were surprised to see mrs  fiander  clad this time not in homely

print but in ceremonious black  standing by her own door  with a severe

expression of countenance   she held a note book in her hand  and as each

arrived she jotted down some memorandum therein   when the last straggler

had appeared upon the scene  she summoned the entire band before her 



‘men ’ she said  speaking calmly and very distinctly  ‘since you seem to

pay no attention to what i say  i must show you that i am not to be

trifled with   i shall fine every one of you this morning for being late 

i shall continue to fine you each morning that you are late  and i shall

deduct from your pay a certain amount for every hour that you wilfully

waste   in fact  for the future your wage shall be in exact proportion to

the work you do ’



the men stared  gaped  and looked sullenly first at one another and then

at their mistress 



‘do you understand ’ she inquired sharply 



job hunt  his red bearded face even more glowing than usual  answered in

surly tones for himself and comrades 



‘nay  missus  us can’t say as we do ’



‘well  then  i’ll make it clear to you ’ rang out the brisk young voice 

‘you are paid for the work you do during certain hours  and if you don’t

come here punctually  or if you waste any of those hours  i shall deduct

from your weekly wage the value of the lost time—i shan’t pay you  in

fact  for work you don’t do ’



‘nay  now ’ responded job  rolling his head from side to side  and

assuming a bullying air   ‘i don’t hold wi’ these here reg’lations   us

don’t want no new rules  do us  mates ’



‘nay  that we don’t ’ came the answer in a chorus of growls 



‘whether you want them or not  i mean to keep to them ’ returned rosalie 

‘that will do  you can all go to work now ’



she turned  and went into the house  her heart was beating very fast  and

she was rather white about the lips  but she had borne herself bravely 

and no one would have guessed the difficulty she had found in nerving

herself to take this stand 



she could hear the men’s voices murmuring together discontentedly  but

by and by the sound of heavy slouching steps moving away in different

directions warned her that the group had dispersed 



it being the morning for cheese making  she presently went upstairs to

change her imposing black robe for her working dress  and  chancing as

she came downstairs to look out of the window  she observed that job hunt

was standing  arms a kimbo  by the pigsties  in close conversation with

his brother   now  job should at that moment have been far on his way to

the pasture  abel ought to have been feeding the pigs  this was palpable

defiance 



‘deeds  not words ’ said rosalie to herself   ‘they think i am merely

threatening—i must show them i am in earnest ’



she went across the yard  note book in hand 



‘it is now half past five ’ she remarked   ‘you  job  are two hours and a

half late  you  abel  an hour   i have made a note of the time 

moreover  if i find that you continue to disobey me i shall not keep you

in my service ’



job made an indescribable sound  between a snort and a groan  and slowly

walked away   abel  however  continued to stare darkly at his mistress 

without changing his position 



as rosalie  now thoroughly incensed  was about to pour out upon him the

vials of her wrath  she suddenly perceived—the fact being unmistakably

impressed upon her—that the pigsties near which she stood were in a most

disgraceful condition 



‘abel ’ she said  ‘when were these sties cleaned out   not  i am sure  on

saturday ’



‘i were—mortal busy o’ saturday ’ returned abel in sepulchral tones 



‘why were you more busy last saturday than on any other saturday ’



abel shuffled from one foot to the other  and repeated sulkily that he

had been mortal busy 



‘you must clean them as soon as ever you have fed the pigs ’ said rosalie

sharply   ‘’t is enough to bring fever to the place to have them in this

state ’



‘pigs is n’t p’ison ’ responded abel roughly 



‘do not attempt to answer me back like that ’ she cried   ‘it must be

very bad for the poor animals themselves   get to work without a moment’s

delay ’



‘saturday is the day ’ growled the man   ‘i’m—blowed if i clean ’em out

afore saturday ’



‘mind what you are about ’ said his mistress sternly  uplifting a warning

fore finger   ‘i will not put up with impertinence or disobedience ’



‘saturday is the day ’ shouted abel  and the shuffling movement became so

violent and rapid that he actually seemed to dance 



‘this will never do ’ said rosalie   ‘i see i must make a change at once 

abel hunt  i give you notice to leave on saturday week ’



‘one change be enough for me  widow fiander ’ retorted abel  uplifting

his voice as though his mistress stood a hundred yards away from him

instead of barely two 



rosalie’s lips quivered 



‘’t is your own fault ’ she cried passionately   ‘if you behave in this

way i must make an example of you   unless you do as i tell you  you must

go ’



‘i’m danged if i do clean the pigs out afore saturday ’ shrieked abel 

and he threw his hat upon the ground  waved his arms  and stamped about

like a maniac   ‘i don’t want no danged women folk to come a orderin’ o’

me ’ and here abel relieved his feelings by what isaac sharpe would

delicately call ‘a bit o’ language ’



‘clean your pigs yourself  widow fiander   one change be enough for me 

notice me so much as ever ye like  i’ll not clean them pigs out afore

saturday ’



then came a little more ‘language ’ and so on  da capo  



never had such an experience fallen to rosalie’s lot before  neither her

kind old grandfather nor her doting husband had ever given her a rough

word  while they lived her subordinates had invariably obeyed her orders

with alacrity  and treated her personally with respect   the sound of

abel’s strident tones  the sight of his inflamed face  above all the

words he used and the insolence of his manner  positively frightened her 

she turned pale  trembled—then  making a valiant effort to stand her

ground  threw out her hand as though to command silence  but  as abel

continued to dance and rave  sheer physical terror overcame her  and she

suddenly turned and fled  her heart thumping violently against her ribs 

the tears—never very far off during these first days of her

bereavement—springing to her eyes 



she rushed upstairs to her room and flung herself across the bed  burying

her face in the pillow in an agony of humiliation 



‘what a fool i am   what a miserable fool   to be afraid of that wretched

booby   how can i ever hope to rule these people if i show the white

feather at the outset   now  of course  they will think that they’ve only

got to bully me and i shall at once give in   oh  fool  fool   to give

way to silly womanish fears at such a moment   oh  oh  how shall i ever

look them in the face ’



she continued to roll her head on the pillow for some moments  her cheeks

had now become burning  and her heart still beat fast  no longer with

terror  but with anger   by and by she sat up  pushed back her hair  and

shook out the folds of her dress 



‘after all  ’t is never too late to mend ’ she said to herself 



she went downstairs  and into the dairy  directing her maids somewhat

sharply  and setting about her own work with flushed cheeks and a serious

face   in course of time her agitation subsided  and after her solitary

breakfast she was quite herself again 



at noon  as she passed through the kitchen to the parlour  she chanced to

glance through the open door  and observed that the men had gathered

together in the yard  and were eagerly talking instead of making their

way homewards  or retiring to the barn to eat their dinners   she feigned

to pay no attention to them  however  and walked on to her own quarters 



presently she became aware that the whole body was advancing towards the

house  and a moment later susan thrust in her round face at the door 



‘please  mum  the men be wishin’ to speak a few words with ’ee ’



‘very well ’ said rosalie  ‘i will go out to them ’



on reaching the threshold of the outer door she paused  looking round on

the group  and waiting for them to take the initiative   job was  as

before  the first to speak 



‘i be come to tell ’ee  mrs  fiander  as i wish to notice ye for saturday

week   these here changes bain’t to my likin’  and the mistress bain’t to

my likin’  so ye’ll please to suit yourself by that time  mum ’



he spoke gruffly  and eyed her impertinently  but this time she did not

flinch 



‘very well  job ’ she said  ‘i have no doubt i shall be able to do so

without any difficulty ’



abel was the next to advance  but rosalie waved him aside 



‘as it has already been settled that you are to leave ’ she remarked 

‘you can have nothing to say to me   step back   now who comes next ’



james bundy  it seemed  came next  he approached a little hesitatingly 

looking hard at his mistress 



‘please  mum  i wish to leave on saturday week ’



‘quite right ’ returned rosalie with great unconcern   ‘next ’



james bundy stepped back and robert cross stepped forward  smiling

obsequiously 



‘i’m sure  mum  it do go agen me terrible to make sich a break as this

here  but still  d’ ye see  we can’t nohow put up with—’



‘you need not take the trouble to explain—you wish to leave on saturday

week with the others  i suppose ’



‘’ees—leastways—’



‘that will do ’ said rosalie   ‘now  sam belbin  you wish to leave too ’



sam belbin made a step forward and glanced round appealingly 



by this time his companions were looking very blank   the sudden assault

by which they had expected to frighten their mistress into capitulation

had apparently failed   their respective attitudes had changed  she was

calm and unmoved  and they were beginning to be seriously uneasy   good

places and regular pay were not to be picked up every day in that part of

the world 



‘well  sam ’ said rosalie kindly  as though to help him out 



sam was the chief of the three ‘dairy chaps ’ a good looking young fellow

of about four and twenty  with a dark  good humoured countenance and a

certain jaunty air   as he now advanced a smile flashed suddenly over his

face  his white teeth gleaming out pleasantly 



‘mum ’ he said   ‘mum—mrs  fiander—’



she smiled too 



‘well  sam  what have  you  got to say   the usual thing  i suppose ’



‘no  mum—not at all  mum   i—wish to say as i haven’t got no fault to

find at all  mum   i’ll come in better time to morrow morn  an’ ye’ll not

have to speak to me agen  mum ’



‘ very  good ’ said rosalie in a different tone   at this unexpected

speech a lump came in her throat  but she choked it down 



‘have the others got anything to say ’ she inquired   ‘because  if so  i

hope they will make haste and say it   my dinner will be getting cold ’



the men who had not hitherto spoken looked at each other uncertainly 

their glances finally resting on the beaming countenance of sam belbin 

after all  had he not chosen the better part 



‘i do agree with he ’ said one under his breath  and then another 

by and by all remarked aloud  somewhat falteringly  that they just

thought they would mention their wish to give more satisfaction in the

future 



job and his followers scowled at these renegades  but their mistress

rewarded them with a gracious smile 



‘very well said ’ she remarked   ‘that’s the proper spirit   do your duty

by me  and you will find me ready to do mine by you ’



the day was hers  as she felt when she returned in triumph to her dinner 



isaac sharpe happened to be strolling through the village that evening 

when he was accosted by mrs  belbin  who was standing  as was her custom

at this hour  arms a kimbo  on her doorstep 



‘there be a great upset up at fiander’s  bain’t there  sir ’



isaac brought his slow  ruminative gaze to bear on her 



‘why  what upset do ye mean  mrs  belbin   things be like to be upset now

that the master’s gone to the new house   but i hope as your son an’ the

rest of ’em be giving the widow so little trouble as ever they can ’



‘i dunno about that  sir   my sam he do tell i as there was a regular

blow up this mornin’   i d’ ’low as my son  he  did behave so well as

ever he could   says he to mrs  fiander  “mum ” he says  “i have n’t no

fault to find wi’ you at all  and i’ll do my  h endeavours to gi’e ye

satisfaction ”  that were what  he  did say—my son sam did  but there was

others as  accordin’ to all accounts  went on most scandalious ’



here mrs  belbin rolled up her eyes and wagged her head significantly 



‘ah ’ put in mrs  paddock  hastening to cross the road and join in the

conversation  ‘it did give me sich a turn when i heard on it  that i did

sit down on the table   ’t were a good job as i did  else i should ha’

fell down   sich doin’s   the whole lot of ’em—aye  every single one as

works for her—marchin’ up to give her notice   ’t was enough to frighten

a pore lone woman out of her wits ’



‘i have n’t heard a word of this ’ cried isaac emphatically   ‘the men

gave her notice  d’ ye say ’



‘all except my sam ’ put in mrs  belbin proudly   ‘’ees  they all did go

up in a lump  so to speak  and noticed her  one arter the other  till it

come to my sam’s turn  an’ then he up an’ says  “mrs  fiander  mum ” says

he  “i have n’t got no fault to find wi’ ye ” and a few more  when they

heard that  heartened theirselves up and follered his example ’



‘’t was very well done o’ your sam ’ said mrs  paddock in a complimentary

tone  ‘but as for them others—why  they do say as abel hunt were

a dancin’ an’ a swearin’ like a madman   “i want no orderin’ from danged

women folk ” says he  just so bold as if the missus was his wife   and

job  he did shout at her so rough  and speak so impident   ’t was really

shockin’ ’



‘i must go up and see her ’ said sharpe  much perturbed   ‘i’m sure i

don’t know whatever’s come to folks these times   as to them hunts—i’ll

gi’e them a bit o’ my mind   they should be ashamed o’ theirselves to

treat a pore young creature so disrespectful   they do think  i s’ppose 

as mrs  fiander has n’t got nobody to purtect her  and they can serve her

so bad as they like   but them as was friends to her husband is friends

to her   pore young thing   well  i be glad your son did do his duty by

her  anyways  mrs  belbin   my father a’mighty  these be times ’



he walked away at an accelerated pace  the women looking after him 



‘he did speak so feelin’  did n’t he ’ commented mrs  paddock   ‘“pore

young creature ” says he  d’ ye mind   an’ “pore young thing ”  master be

a very feelin’ man ’



‘ah ’ agreed mrs  belbin  ‘an’ he did say as he were glad my sam did do

his duty   ah  he be a good man  master be   but i would n’t like so very

much to be abel hunt jist now—nay  nor job neither ’







chapter vi





    souvent femme varie 

    bien fol est qui s’y fie 



the mistress of littlecomb farm had no cause to complain of the

unpunctuality of any of her workpeople on the following morning   each

man appeared at the very moment he was supposed to appear  the maids were

up betimes  and the business of the day progressed with far greater speed

than usual 



at dinner time she again observed a group of men in the yard  smaller in

number  however  than on the preceding day  and talking with dismal

countenances and hesitating tones   susan came presently to announce  as

before  that some of the men wished to speak to her 



rosalie went out  and discovered a detachment of four awaiting her  two

with plaintive  wobegone faces  the others in a state of surly

depression 



‘missus ’ stammered james bundy  ‘we be a come—me and these here chaps—be

a come to ’pologise  and to say as we hopes ye won’t bear no malice  and

as ye’ll overlook what has passed   we’ll undertake to give satisfaction

from this time for’ard ’



‘’t is a pity you did not say that yesterday  james ’ said rosalie

severely 



bundy looked at cross  and the latter’s jaw fell 



‘if ye’d please to overlook it  mum ’ resumed james  falteringly   ‘we

was  so to speak  took by surprise wi’ the new rules  and we was

persuaded’—here he darted a reproachful glance at joe—‘i’ve got a long

family  mum ’ he added tearfully  ‘and my wife—she be near her time wi’

the eleventh—’



‘well  james  you have been foolish  but i do not altogether think it was

your fault   i will make no definite promise  but i will see how you go

on between this and saturday week ’



‘i be to go on saturday week ’ ejaculated james  whose wits were none of

the keenest  and who was more impressed by the severity of the tone than

by rosalie’s actual words 



‘no  no  you foolish fellow   come  i will give you another chance  but

mind you behave very well ’



robert cross next came forward 



‘mine be a very long family  too ’ he began  having evidently remarked

the happy results which had ensued from bundy’s plea   rosalie stopped

him 



‘well  i will give you another chance  cross ’ she said   ‘next time 

think twice before you follow a bad leader   as for you  abel hunt ’ she

said  turning sternly to that gentleman  ‘i am at a loss to know what you

can have to say—in fact  i have no wish to hear it  whatever it may be 

you must go   no apology can atone for your insolence yesterday ’



‘and how be you goin’ to manage about them pigs ’ inquired abel

plaintively 



‘that is no concern of yours ’



‘mr  sharpe was a speakin’ to me yesterday ’ put in job  very humbly  for

his courage was fast oozing away  ‘an’ he did say ’twould be terrible

ill convenient for ’ee to have so many chaps a leavin’ together  an’ so

me an’ my brother agreed as we’d ax to stop on ’



‘i can do very well without you ’ retorted mrs  fiander tartly   ‘no 

job  you have behaved too badly   you have been the ringleader of this

disgraceful business—you must certainly go ’



‘on saturday week ’ faltered job 



‘yes  saturday week—you  and  abel   how abel can suppose i could

possibly keep him after such conduct  i can’t imagine   i certainly will

not ’



‘mr  sharpe did say’—job was beginning  now almost in tears  when she

interrupted him relentlessly 



‘never mind what mr  sharpe said   i have quite made up my mind as to

what i shall do ’



she was thoroughly in earnest  and the men knew it   they fell back

ruefully  and their young mistress returned to the house  carrying her

head very high and setting her face sternly 



when her work was over that afternoon she set out  with a business like

air  on what seemed to be a tour of inspection  first walking briskly

along the rows of pigsties  the condition of which had on the day before

given rise to so much controversy   all was now as it should be  abel 

sam  and one or two of the other subordinates having devoted their

attention to them at early dawn   here were pigs of every age and degree 

from the venerable matron to the spry young porker just beginning to

devote himself to the serious business of life—namely  growing fat 

seventy two in all  and most of them doomed to destruction within a few

months  that was the part of the economy of farming which rosalie most

disliked  it was the blot on the otherwise poetical and peaceful

avocation   but she had hitherto been taught to consider the presence of

these pigs an absolute necessity   was this really the case   might not

she  with her woman’s wit  devise some better expedient by means of which

the obnoxious animals could be dispensed with  and at the same time waste

of skim milk and whey avoided 



leaving the yard  she betook herself to the orchard  where a few more

porcine families were taking exercise   their presence somewhat detracted

from the picturesque appearance of the place  which  though the ‘blooth’

or blossom had long since fallen  had still a considerable share of

beauty of its own   the sunlight beating down now through the delicate

green leafage brought out wonderful silvery lights from the lichened

trunks  and outlined the curiously gnarled branches   it struck out a

golden path across the lush grass for rosalie to walk on  and she passed

slowly down the glade with bent head and serious face 



turning when she reached the end to retrace her steps  she saw a

well known sturdy form approaching her  and advanced to meet isaac

sharpe  still with a certain queenly air  and without quickening her

pace   isaac’s countenance  on the contrary  wore a perturbed and puzzled

expression  his brow was anxiously furrowed  and he gazed hard at mrs 

fiander as he hastened towards her 



‘i’m a feared ye’ve had a deal o’ trouble  here ’ he began 



‘yes  i followed your advice  you see ’



‘and it did n’t altogether answer ’ said the farmer  with a nervous

laugh 



‘oh  yes  it answered very well   i think the men know i’m in earnest

now ’



‘them two hunts come round to my place at dinner time  they were in a

taking  poor chaps   but ’twill do them good   all the same  i think i’d

let ’em off  if i was you  mrs  fiander   job be a roughish sort o’ chap 

but he be a good cowman  an’ abel  he be wonderful with the management o’

pigs ’



‘i’m not going to let them off ’ said rosalie  her face hardening again

as she thought of abel’s maniacal dance  and of the loud voice which had

frightened her  and of job’s insolent manner when he had said  ‘the

missus bain’t to my likin’ ’



‘well  but ’twill be a bit ’ard to find as good ’ isaac objected 

‘p’r’aps ye’ll not better yourself   i doubt ’t will be harder for you to

get on wi’ strange men ’



‘i am not going to put strange men in their place   i am not going to

hire any more men  i’m going to have women   i can manage women very

well ’



‘but  my dear ’ cried isaac  opening his eyes very wide  and speaking in

horror stricken tones  ‘women can’t do men’s work ’



‘no  but they can do women’s work   i have thought it all out  mr 

sharpe  and my mind is made up   job and abel must go   i shall put sam

belbin in job’s place ’



‘well  he have behaved well to ’ee ’ conceded isaac  unwillingly  ‘but he

be young   i doubt if he’s fit for ’t ’



‘i’ve watched him ’ returned rosalie  positively  ‘and i think he’s quite

fit for it   he has worked under job for some time  and is a capital

milker   i think he will manage very well   as to abel  i shall put no

one in his place  for i mean to sell the pigs ’



‘sell the pigs ’ ejaculated isaac—‘at this time o’ year ’  his face

became absolutely tragic  but rosalie merely nodded 



‘why  what’s to become o’ your skim milk ’ he gasped  ‘an’ the whey  and

that ’



‘there will be no skim milk ’ said rosalie   ‘i shall make blue vinney

cheese  as i used to make when i was with my grandfather   some people

are very fond of it   that is made entirely of skim milk  you know   as

for the whey  there will not be much nourishment in it  but i shall keep

a few sows still  just to consume that and the butter milk   they will

not require much attention as they walk about here  you see  and there is

always a lot of waste green stuff ’



‘i don’t think ye’ll find many folks here what cares for the blue vinney

cheese ’ said isaac  still much dejected   ‘nay  ’t is all the ha’ skim

as they likes hereabouts   the blue vinney has gone out o’ fashion  so to

speak ’



‘if they don’t buy them here i can send them to dorchester ’ said the

widow resolutely   ‘they used to buy them up there faster than i could

make them   so you see there will be no waste  mr  sharpe  there will be

less work to do outside  and therefore i shall not miss job or abel  but 

as we shall be very busy in the dairy  i must have two or three extra

women to help me ’



isaac stared at her ruefully  she looked brighter than she had done since

her husband’s death  but she also looked determined   he shook his head

slowly  his mind was of the strictly conservative order  and the

contemplated abolition of pigs from the premises of this large dairy farm

seemed to him an almost sacrilegious innovation   moreover  to sell pigs

in july  to make cheeses that nobody in that part of the world cared to

eat  to replace two seasoned men who knew their business—whatever might

be their faults—with that dangerous commodity  womankind—the whole

experiment seemed to him utterly wild  and pregnant with disaster 



‘i mean to do it ’ said rosalie  defying the condemnation in his face 

‘by this time next year you will congratulate me on my success ’



‘i hope so  i am sure ’ said isaac in a slightly offended tone   ‘i came

here to advise ’ee  but it seems ye don’t want no advice ’



‘oh yes  i do ’ she cried  softening in a moment   ‘i value it of all

things  mr  sharpe   my one comfort in my difficulties is the thought

that i can talk them over with you   i have laid my plan before you quite

simply  in the hope that you would approve ’



‘well  my dear ’ said isaac  somewhat mollified  ‘i don’t approve  d’ ye

see   since you ask my advice  i’ll tell ye plain that i don’t think the

plan will work   ye won’t be able to sell your pigs to begin with  then

ye’ll want a man wi’ more experience than sam to look after the cows  it

bain’t such easy work—nay  that it bain’t   then  as to gettin’ more

women ’bout the place  i don’t hold with the notion   i don’t think it

’ud benefit ye  my dear   i don’t trewly ’



rosalie appeared to meditate 



‘think it over  mrs  fiander ’ he urged  ‘don’t do nothing in a hurry 

that be my advice ’



‘thank you very much   yes  i’ll think it over   you’ll come on sunday 

won’t you  mr  sharpe ’



‘’ees ’ agreed isaac doubtfully   ‘’ees  i’ll come on sunday   i be main

glad you be thinking of taking my advice  mrs  fiander ’



‘i am grateful to you for giving it ’ said rosalie with a sweet smile 

and the farmer walked away  thinking that on the whole women were far

less unreasonable than he had hitherto supposed 



the next day was thursday—early closing day at branston—therefore no one

was surprised when mrs  fiander  having as she averred some business to

do in the town  ordered the gig in the forenoon   it was the first time

she had used that vehicle since her husband’s death  and she looked

sorrowful enough as she climbed into it  clad in her deepest weeds 



the steady old horse looked round when she gathered up the reins  as

though wondering at the innovation—for elias had always been accustomed

to drive—and was with some difficulty induced to start 



‘nigger be so wise as a christian  that he be ’ commented bundy  as the

gig and its occupant disappeared   ‘he was a standin’ and a waitin’ for

master  so sensible as i mid do myself   but he’ll have to get used to

the change the same as the rest of us ’



‘ay  an’ p’r’aps he’ll not like it so very well ’ returned abel

sardonically   ‘give a woman a whip in her hand  and she fancies she’s

bound to lay it on ’



but nigger was suffered to jog along the road at his own pace  for the

old sadness which had fallen upon rosalie had for a moment checked her

eager spirit  and a new preoccupation was  moreover  now added to it 

would elias approve of what she was about to do  or would he agree with

isaac   no  surely he would say that she knew best  he was always pleased

with anything she did   he used to say that she was the best manager he

had ever known  and  on the other hand  used frequently to speak of

isaac’s ‘notions’ with good humoured derision   it will be seen that mrs 

fiander’s meditations over her friend’s advice had resulted  as indeed

might have been expected  in the determination to adhere to her original

plan  and she was now on her way to interview two personages whose

co operation would be necessary in carrying it out 



her appearance in the shop of mr  hardy  the principal grocer of the

town  caused a certain amount of commotion  everybody turned to look at

the beautiful young widow  who had indeed for many days past formed the

principal topic of conversation among the townsfolk  and much interest

was aroused by her murmured request to see mr  hardy in private 



‘certainly  mrs  fiander   step this way  ma’am   john  open the door

there ’



john hardy  a tall  good looking young man in a white linen jacket 

hastened to obey his parent’s behest  and was even good enough to

accompany the visitor along the passage which led from the shop to the

family sitting room   it was empty at this hour  mrs  hardy being

presumably occupied in household duties  and mr  john ushered rosalie in

with much ceremony  and invited her to be seated in the best armchair 



some disappointment was perceptible in his ingenuous countenance when he

found that the interview which had been so mysteriously asked for was

merely connected with cheese  but his father listened to rosalie’s

proposition with grave attention 



‘i don’t exactly see how the plan would work ’ he remarked  shaking his

head   ‘we sell your ha’skim cheeses very fairly well  mrs  fiander ’

mr  hardy was a discreet person  and was determined not to commit

himself   ‘but as for the blue vinney  i’d be very glad to oblige you 

but i’m really afraid—you see there’s scarcely any demand for blue vinney

nowadays   a few of the old folks ask for it now and then  but we don’t

get  not to say  a reg’lar custom for ’t  and it would n’t be worth our

while to keep it ’



‘i am considered a particularly good hand at making blue vinney ’ said

rosalie   ‘i used to be quite celebrated for it when i lived near

dorchester—in fact  i could easily sell my cheeses now at dorchester 

only i thought i would give you the first offer as you have dealt with me

so long ’



growing warm in her excitement  she threw back her veil  john hardy 

gazing at her flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes  thought mrs  fiander had

never looked so handsome as in her widow’s weeds 



‘dorchester ’ commented the senior   ‘that would be a long way for you to

send  ma’am ’



‘i am sure ’ put in the son quickly  ‘we’d be sorry to think as mrs 

fiander should need to take her cheeses to dorchester  father ’



the elder mr  hardy glanced from one to the other of the two young faces 

and  as rosalie bestowed a grateful smile upon his son  an idea seemed to

strike him 



‘well ’ he said good naturedly  ‘you are trying an experiment  i

understand  mrs  fiander   there’s always a certain amount o’ risk in an

experiment  but still  “nothing venture  nothing have ” they say   if

you’re willing to venture i shall be glad to help you all i can   send

your cheeses to me  and i’ll do my best to sell ’em   i won’t promise to

pay money down for ’em ’ he added  cautiously  ‘same as i do for the

ha’skims  but i’ll try an’ sell ’em for you  and we can settle about them

after ’



‘i am very much obliged ’ said rosalie  a little blankly  however  for

she had not been accustomed to do business in this manner 



‘we will use our utmost endeavours to push the goods—of that you may be

sure ’ cried young john eagerly  and she smiled upon him again  so

graciously that he somewhat lost his head  and made several incoherent

statements as to the excellence of blue vinney cheese for which his

worthy father subsequently brought him to book 



‘that’s not the way to get round a woman  my lad ’ he remarked   ‘mrs  f 

will just think you be right down silly  the notion o’ tellin’ her as

blue vinney cheese was richer to the palate than rammil—why  rammil’s

made altogether o’ good new milk  and this here’s nothin’ but skim   she

makes cheese o’ skim instead o’ givin’ it to the pigs  and you go and

tell her all that rubbish   she’s no fool—the widow is n’t—that is n’t

the way to make up to her ’



meanwhile rosalie had driven across the market place and up a side street

to the house of a certain auctioneer  and to her great joy found him at

home 



he was a stout middle aged man  with some pretensions to good looks  and

more to being a dandy   he was attired in a sporting costume of quite

correct cut  and received his visitor with an air of jovial hospitality 



‘delighted to see you  i’m sure  mrs  fiander   i feel  h onoured   i am

at your service for anything you may wish—you may command me  ma’am ’



rosalie had begun by expressing a desire to transact a little business

with him  and now proceeded to explain its nature 



‘i wish to sell my pigs by auction ’ she said   ‘i have about sixty five

to dispose of  and i should like the sale to take place as early as

possible next week ’



‘next week ’ ejaculated the auctioneer  his face falling 



‘yes ’ said rosalie  with great decision 



‘but—have you considered the question   it would be difficult to sell off

such a number of pigs at any season of the year  but now—in the height of

the summer   if i may advise you  mrs  fiander  don’t be in such a hurry 

wait and sell the pigs at a more convenient time   nobody’s killing pigs

now  and most people as go in for fatting pigs have got as many as they

want by this time ’



‘it must be next week ’ said the widow obstinately   job and abel were

leaving on the saturday  and the stock must be got rid of before the new

era began 



‘you’ll lose to a certainty  ma’am ’ said mr  wilson  running his hand

through his well oiled hair   ‘what with all the regulations on account

of the swine fever  the selling of such a number of pigs would be a

difficult matter—at any season  as i say  and you don’t give me no time

scarcely to get out my bills—’



‘the sale must take place before saturday week ’ insisted rosalie   ‘you

must do the best you can for me  mr  wilson ’



‘you may rely on that  mrs  fiander  but it really grieves me to think

that you should lose so much ’



he paused  thoughtfully biting the end of one finger  and suffering his

eyes meanwhile to travel slowly over the handsome face and graceful

figure of his client   during this scrutiny he was not unobservant of the

rich materials of which her dress was composed  and her general

appearance of mournful prosperity 



‘well  i’ll tell you what i’ll do  he said   ‘it’s against my own

interest  but i always like to oblige a lady—particularly such a lady as

you  mrs  fiander   i’ll drive round the country and see if i can

persuade people to buy up those pigs by private contract   i know a

pig jobber over shaftesbury side as might be glad to take a good many off

you  if he got them at a low price   if i understand you  mrs  fiander 

the price is not an object to you ’



‘no—o ’ faltered rosalie   ‘of course  i should like as much money as

possible for them  but the price is not so important as to get rid of the

animals as soon as possible ’



‘just so ’ agreed the auctioneer cheerfully   ‘well  mrs  fiander  i

shall lose by it  as i say  but i will try and arrange matters for you in

this way   under the circumstances  ma’am  i grudge no time or trouble

spent in your service   i am always thought to be a lady’s man—my late

poor wife used to say that my consideration for ladies injured the

business  but  as i used to tell her  a man has a heart or else he has

n’t    if  he has a heart—if he has more feelings than his neighbours  he

is n’t to blame for it   “let the business go  my dear ” i ’d say  “but

don’t ask me to be hard on a woman ”’



it had been whispered among the gossips of branston that during the

lifetime of the late mrs  wilson her lord had been wont to correct her

occasionally with a boot jack  but these rumours had not reached

rosalie’s ears  and even if they had she would probably have disbelieved

them   nevertheless  she did not quite like the manner in which the

gallant auctioneer leered at her  nor his unnecessarily warm pressure of

her hand on saying good bye 



she drove homewards with a mixture of feelings   the inauguration of her

new plan seemed to involve a considerable amount of risk  not to say

loss  she felt conscious of the fact that she owed her very partial

success more to the persuasion of her beauty than to faith in her

prospects as a woman of business  yet there was  after all  satisfaction

in thinking that she had carried her point 







chapter vii





    he that will not love must be

    my scholar  and learn this of me 

    there be in love as many fears

    as the summer’s corn has ears 



                                           



    would’st thou know  besides all these 

    how hard a woman ’t is to please 

    how cross  how sullen  and how soon

    she shifts and changes like the moon 



                                                                  herrick 



it was with some trepidation that rosalie awaited isaac’s visit on the

sunday following that long and eventful week   the good fellow was 

indeed  so overcome when he found himself seated once more in the

familiar chair  with the vacant place opposite to him  that she had not

courage to make a confession which would  she knew  distress and annoy

him—a confession which would have to be made  nevertheless 



her own eyes filled as she saw isaac unaffectedly wiping away his tears

with his great red and yellow handkerchief  and for some moments no word

was spoken between them   she filled his pipe and lit it for him  but he

suffered it to rest idly between his fingers  and made no attempt to sip

at the tumbler of spirits and water which she placed at his elbow 



‘let’s talk of him ’ she murmured softly  at last  bending forward 

‘tell me about when you knew him first ’



‘lard ’ said sharpe with a sniff  ‘i know’d him all his life  i may say 

i were with him when he were confirmed—and i were at both his weddin’s 

yours was the only one i was n’t at ’



rosalie straightened herself  feeling as if a douche of cold water had

been unexpectedly applied to her 



‘ah ’ went on isaac  shaking his head mournfully  ‘i knowed his fust and

his second missus well—they was nice women  both on ’em   the fust was a

bit near  but  as poor ’lias used to say  ’twas a good fault   ah  he’d

say that—a good fault ’



he put his pipe between his lips  and immediately took it out again 



‘the second mrs  fiander ’ he went on  ‘was a good creatur’ too—very

savin’  delicate  though  but he’d al’ays make allowances  her husband

would  though it did seem to me sometimes as it was a bit disheartenin’

to a man when his wife got the ’titus just at the busiest time of year 

ah  he used to tell me often as it were n’t no use to be a dairy farmer

without you had a active wife ’



rosalie fidgeted in her chair  these little anecdotes of isaac seemed to

her rather pointless under the present circumstances 



‘all i can say is ’ she remarked after a pause  ‘that  i  always found

poor dear elias the most considerate of men ’



‘i d’ ’low ye did ’ said isaac  turning his moist eyes upon her   ‘he

thought a deal o’ you—he did that   says he to me the first night i come

here  when you come home arter getting wed  “i d’ ’low ” says he  “she’s

the best o’ the three ”’



there was comfort in this thought  and rosalie looked gratefully at her

visitor  whose eyes had again become suffused with tears as he recalled

this touching tribute 



‘he used to say ’ she observed presently in a low voice  ‘that i was a

very good manager  but i don’t think it was on that account alone he was

so fond of me ’



‘’ees  he did use to say you was a wonderful manager ’ said isaac 

disregarding the latter part of the sentence   ‘many a time he’ve a told

me that you had n’t got no equal as a manager ’



sentiment was evidently not to be the order of the day  but here  at

least  was an opportunity of introducing the little matter of business

which weighed so heavily on rosalie’s conscience 



‘i think ’ she said  diffidently  ‘he would say i was wise in carrying

out this new plan ’



‘what new plan ’ inquired isaac  pausing with his handkerchief halfway to

his eyes  and turning towards her sternly  though the tears hung upon his

grizzled lashes 



‘why  the one i spoke to you of—about doing away with the pigs  you

know ’ she returned faintly 



‘that there notion that i gi’e ye my advice agen ’ said sharpe grimly 



‘yes ’ hesitatingly   ‘i thought it over  as you told me to  and i did

n’t think i could manage differently   i find i can sell the pigs all

right  and mr  hardy has promised to try and dispose of my blue vinney

cheeses ’



isaac blew his nose  returned his handkerchief to his pocket  and stood

up 



‘i’m glad to hear as ye can manage so well ’ he said sarcastically   ‘you

don’t want no advice  that’s plain  and i sha’n’t never offer you none

agen   i’ll wish ye good day  mrs  fiander ’



‘oh  don’t go away like that ’ cried she piteously   ‘please don’t be

offended with me   such an old friend—’



at this moment a figure passed across the window  and a loud knock was

heard at the house door   rosalie rushed to the door of the parlour 



‘don’t let any one in  susan ’ she cried   ‘say i’m—i’m engaged   stay at

least a minute  mr  sharpe—i want to tell you—i want to explain ’



throwing out one hand in pleading  she held open the parlour door an inch

or two with the other  and presently the manly tones of mr  cross were

heard through the chink 



‘i am sorry to hear that mrs  fiander is engaged   will you kindly inform

her that i will call next sunday ’



‘tell him  susan ’ said her mistress  opening the door a little way  and

speaking under her breath—‘tell him that i am always engaged on sunday ’



susan was heard to impart this information  and then the visitor’s tones

were heard again 



‘that’s a pity   tell her  if you please  that i shall ’ope to have the

pleasure of finding her at home some afternoon during the week ’



‘i am always out in the afternoon ’ said rosalie  speaking this time so

decidedly that it was not necessary for susan to repeat her words 



‘oh ’ said the young man  addressing this time not the maid but the

bright eye of which he caught a glimpse through the door  ‘then i shall

take my chance of finding you in the morning ’



‘i am too busy to see anyone in the morning ’ retorted rosalie  and she

shut the door with a finality which left mr  cross no option but to

depart 



‘you see i do take your advice sometimes ’ said rosalie  turning to

isaac  and speaking in a plaintive tone  though a little smile played

about her mouth 



isaac’s back was towards her  and he made no reply  as she approached the

burly form  however  she saw his shoulders heave  and presently  to her

great relief  discovered that he was shaking with silent laughter 



‘well  my dear  ye don’t do things by halves—i’ll say that for ’ee ’ he

chuckled   you’ve a got rid o’ that there chap  anyhow   he’ll not ax to

come coortin’ again   well  well  if ye manage as well in other ways i’ll

not say that ye bain’t fit to look arter yourself ’



‘but it was your advice  you know  mr  sharpe ’ she said demurely   ‘you

gave me the hint about shutting the door ’



‘i d’ ’low i did ’ said isaac  and  being a good natured and placable

person  his transitory sense of resentment was soon replaced by thorough

appreciation of the humorous side of the situation 



the discomfiture of samuel cross gave a salutary lesson not only to

himself  but to sundry other adventurous young men who had been a little

hasty in their overtures to mrs  fiander   it was soon noised abroad that

the young widow wished for the present to keep herself to herself  as the

saying went  and that it would in consequence be advisable to abstain

from making advances to her—at least  until she had laid aside her crape 



for some months  therefore  rosalie enjoyed comparative immunity from the

importunities which had so much annoyed her  while the new arrangements

appeared to work amazingly well both within and without littlecomb farm 



job and abel departed in due course  the pigs were sold—at considerable

loss to their owner  sam was installed as chief cowman  and sustained his

honours cheerfully  without  however  appearing to be unduly elated  and

three strapping damsels were engaged as dairy maids   with their

co operation mrs  fiander turned out weekly a score and more of large

round cheeses  which were stowed away in an upper room until  in course

of time  they should become sufficiently ripe—some people might use the

term mouldy—to have earned their title of ‘blue vinney’ cheese 



this process took a considerable time  and meanwhile the profits of the

dairy were a good deal lessened since rosalie had left off making the

ha’skim cheeses  for which she had been so particularly famed  and for

which she had invariably received regular payment   still  as she told

herself  when the blue vinneys were disposed of  she would receive her

money in a lump sum  and all would be the same in the end 



her chief trouble at this time arose from the frequent calls of mr 

wilson  the auctioneer  who  though he could not be said to be regularly

paying attention to rosalie  found  nevertheless  sundry excuses for

‘dropping in’ and conversing with her at all manner of unseasonable

times   he made  as has been implied  no direct advances  and rosalie 

moreover  could not treat him so unceremoniously as she had treated mr 

cross  for she felt in a manner indebted to him about the sale of those

unlucky pigs   he had carried the matter through for her with great

difficulty to himself  as he frequently assured her  and he had steadily

refused all remuneration   it was hard  therefore  for the young widow to

repel or avoid him  and she was in consequence reluctantly obliged to

endure many hours of his society 







chapter viii





    your own fair youth  you care so little for it 

    smiling towards heaven  you would not stay the advances

    of time and change upon your happiest fancies 

    i keep your golden hour  and will restore it 



                                                            alice meynell 



one september day rosalie betook herself to the little churchyard where

elias lay at rest   three months had elapsed since he had been taken from

her  and she had not let a week pass without visiting and decorating his

grave   she thought of him often  and her affectionate regret was in no

way diminished  yet  though she was now on her way to perform this

somewhat melancholy duty  she advanced with a bright face and a rapid

bounding step 



she was young  full of vigour and elasticity  and on such a day as

this—an exquisite golden day  full of sunshine  and yet with a tartness

hinting of approaching autumn in the air—every fibre of her being

thrilled with the very joy of life 



when she knelt by her husband’s grave  however  her face became pensive

and her movements slow   taking a pair of garden shears from the basket

which she carried  she clipped the short grass closer still  laid the

flowers gently down on the smooth surface  placed the dead ones in her

basket  and  after lingering a moment  bent forward and kissed the new

white headstone 



as she rose and turned to go away  her face still shadowed by tender

regret  she suddenly perceived that she was not alone   at a little

distance from her  ensconced within the angle of the churchyard wall  a

man was sitting  with an easel in front of him   above the large board on

the easel she caught sight of a brown velveteen coat and a flannel shirt

loosely fastened with a brilliant tie  also of a dark face framed in

rather long black hair and shaded by a soft felt hat of peculiar shape 

from beneath its tilted brim  however  a pair of keen dark eyes were

gazing with intense curiosity at the young woman  and  though he held a

palette in one hand and a brush in the other  he was evidently more

interested in her than in his painting 



rosalie  vexed that her recent display of feeling had been observed by

this stranger  walked quickly down the little path  colouring high with

displeasure the while  and assuming that stately carriage which came

naturally to her in such emergencies 



the gentleman turned slowly on his camp stool  his eyes twinkling and his

dark moustache twitching  and watched her till she was out of sight 



rosalie was clad in her morning print  and wore her wide brimmed chip

hat  so that her attire gave no indication of her station in life   as

her tall figure disappeared the man rose  stepped past his easel—which

supported a canvas whereon already appeared in bold firm lines a sketch

of the antiquated church porch—and made his way up the path and across

the grass to elias fiander’s grave 



‘let us see ’ he murmured  ‘that kiss spoke volumes   it must be a

sweetheart at the very least  yet when she came swinging down the

meadow path she certainly looked heart whole   here we are—a brand new

stone   funny name—elias fiander   no—aged sixty two   must have been her

father  or perhaps her grandfather—the girl looked young enough—so all my

pretty romance has come to nothing   i wish she had stayed a few minutes

longer—i would give something to make a sketch of her ’



he went back to his work whistling  and thinking over rosalie’s beautiful

face and figure regretfully  and with an admiration that was entirely

æsthetic  for he had a cheery  rotund little wife at home in london  and

half a dozen children to provide for  so that he was not given to

sentiment 



it was  perhaps  because his admiration was so innocent and his ambition

so laudable  that a few days later his wish to transfer rosalie’s charms

to canvas was granted in a most unexpected way 



it had been unusually hot  and the artist  having finished his sketch of

the porch  was proceeding by a short cut through littlecomb farm to the

downs beyond  in search of cooler air  when  on crossing a cornfield at

the further end of which the reapers were busily at work  he suddenly

came upon a woman’s figure lying in the shade of a ‘shock’ of sheaves 



the first glance announced her identity  the second assured him that she

was fast asleep   she had removed her hat  and her clasped hands

supported her head  the upward curve of the beautiful arms being

absolutely fascinating to the artist’s eye   the oval face with its warm

colouring  the slightly loosened masses of dark hair  were thrown into

strong relief by the golden background  the absolute abandonment of the

whole form was so perfect in its grace that he paused  trembling with

artistic delight  and hardly daring to breathe lest he should disturb

her 



but rosalie  overcome with the heat and tired out after a hard morning’s

work  slept peacefully on while he swung his satchel round  opened it

quickly  and began with swift deft fingers to make a rapid sketch of her 

a few light pencil strokes suggested the exquisite lines of the prostrate

form  and he had already begun to dash on the colour  when  with a loud

shriek and flapping of wings  a blackbird flew out of the neighbouring

hedge  and rosalie stirred and opened her eyes 



rosalie’s eyes always took people by surprise  and the artist  who had

not before noticed their colour  suffered his to rest upon them

appreciatively while they were still hazy with sleep  but when  with

returning consciousness  he observed a sudden wonder and indignation leap

into them  he threw out his hand hastily 



‘one moment  if you please—stay just as you are for one moment ’



still under the influence of her recent heavy slumber  and taken aback by

the peremptory tone  rosalie obeyed 



‘what are you doing ’ she inquired suspiciously  but without changing her

posture 



‘don’t you see ’ he returned   ‘i am making a picture of you ’



a warm tide of colour spread over the upturned face 



‘you should n’t do that without asking my leave ’



‘a man must take his chances where he finds them ’ said the artist   ‘i

don’t often get such a chance as this   i am a poor man  and can’t afford

to let an opportunity slip ’



he had a shrewd sallow face and kind merry eyes  and as he spoke he

paused in his work and smiled down at her 



‘i don’t want to be disobliging ’ said rosalie  ‘but i—i don’t like it 

i fell asleep by accident—i should n’t have thrown myself down like this

if i had thought anyone was likely to see me ’



‘all the better ’ commented he   ‘you could n’t have put yourself into

such a position if you had tried to   it has evidently come naturally 

and it is simply perfect ’



he paused to squeeze out a little colour from one of the tiny tubes in

his open box  and again smiled encouragingly down at his model 



‘now will you oblige me by closing your eyes again   no  don’t screw them

up like that  let the lids drop gently—so  very good   ’t is a pity to

hide the eyes—one does not often see blue eyes with such murillo

colouring  but the length of the lashes makes amends  and i want you

asleep ’



again a wave of colour swept over rosalie’s face  the stranger marked it

approvingly  and worked on 



‘is it nearly done ’ she inquired presently   ‘you said you would only be

a moment ’



‘i find it will take several moments  but i am sure you would not grudge

me the time if you knew what a wonderful piece of good fortune this is

for me ’



‘how can it be good fortune for you ’



‘don’t frown  please  let the lids lie loosely   i will tell you why i

consider this meeting a piece of good fortune   do you know what it is to

make bread and butter ’



‘i make butter three times a week ’ returned rosalie  somewhat amused 

‘and i make bread too  sometimes ’



‘well  i have got to make bread and butter every day of my life  not only

for myself  but for my wife and six small children  and i have nothing to

make it with but this   you may open your eyes for a moment if you don’t

move otherwise ’



rosalie opened her eyes  and saw that he was bending towards her  and

holding out a paint brush 



‘now  go to sleep again ’ he went on   ‘yes  that’s what i make my

bread and butter with  and it is n’t always an easy task  because there

are a great many other chaps who want to make bread and butter in the

same kind of way  and we can never be quite sure which among the lot of

us will find the best market for his wares   but i shall have no

difficulty in disposing of you  i am certain—therefore  i consider myself

in luck ’



‘do you mean that you will sell that little picture of me ’



‘not this one  but a big one which i shall make from it   it will go to

an exhibition  and people will come and look at it   as the subject is

quite new and very pretty  i shall ask a big price for it  and there will

be lots of bread and butter for a long time to come ’



‘but would anybody care to buy a picture of a woman whom they don’t know 

lying asleep in a cornfield ’ cried rosalie incredulously  and

involuntarily raising her drooped lids 



‘most certainly they will ’ responded the artist confidently   ‘this will

be a lovely thing when it is done   i shall come here to morrow and make

a careful study of this stook against which you are lying  and of the

field  and i shall look about for a few good types of harvesters to put

in the middle distance ’  he was speaking more to himself than to her 

but rosalie listened with deep interest  and watched him sharply through

her half closed lids   suddenly she saw him laugh 



‘perhaps if i come across a very attractive specimen of a rustic  i may

place him just behind the stook here  peering through the sheaves at you 

or bending forward as if he were going to—’



‘oh  don’t ’ cried rosalie  starting violently and opening her eyes wide 

‘no  i won’t have it  i won’t be in the picture at all if you put

anything of that kind in ’



‘not—if i chose a particularly nice young man ’ inquired the painter 

still laughing softly to himself   ‘not if i chose— the  young man ’



‘i am sure i don’t know what you mean ’ protested she  her cheeks crimson

again and her lips quivering   ‘there is no young man ’



‘do you mean to tell me  my dear child  that with that face you have

lived till now without anyone courting you—as i suppose they would call

it ’



‘oh  of course they court me ’ rosalie hastened to admit  ‘but i hate

them all   and they are all very ugly ’ she added eagerly  ‘and would

look dreadful in a picture ’



‘there  you are frowning again   come  let us talk of something less

exciting   keep still  please   so you make butter three times a week  do

you   you are a farmer’s daughter  i suppose ’



‘i was a farmer’s granddaughter ’ she returned   ‘my father was a

schoolmaster ’



‘ah  that accounts for your educated way of speaking ’



‘no  father died when i was quite a baby  but my grandfather sent me to

school ’



‘then you live with your mother  i suppose ’



‘no  i live alone here   this farm belongs to me ’



she could not help peeping out beneath her lashes to judge of the effect

of her words  and was gratified when the busy brush paused and the dark

eyes glanced down at her in astonishment 



‘you live alone here   but this is a big farm—you can’t manage it all

yourself ’



‘yes  i do   it is hard work  but i contrive to do it   i am rather

lonely  though ’



‘that will be remedied in time ’ said the artist encouragingly   ‘the

right man will come along  and perhaps ’ he added with that queer smile

of his  ‘you won’t find him so ugly as the rest ’



‘you don’t know who i am or you would n’t speak like that ’ said rosalie

with dignity  adding  with a softer inflexion of her voice  ‘the right

man has come—and gone   i am a widow ’



and unclasping the hands beneath her head  she thrust forward the left

one with the shining wedding ring 



confusion and concern now replaced the careless gaiety of the stranger’s

face 



‘i beg your pardon ’ he said earnestly  ‘i did not know   you look so

young—i could not guess—but i am very sorry for my foolish talk ’



‘i was married four years ’ said rosalie softly   something gentle and

kindly about the man invited confidence   ‘my poor elias has only been

dead three months ’  she paused abruptly  astonished at the sudden

expression of blank bewilderment on the other’s face 



‘your husband’s name was elias’ he queried   ‘i beg your pardon for what

must seem idle curiosity   was it—was it his grave that i saw you

visiting the other day ’



‘yes ’ said rosalie  sighing and blushing  ‘yes  i—i thought i was

alone ’



‘ aged sixty two  ’ quoted the artist to himself  and he raised his hand

to his mouth for a moment to conceal its tell tale quivering   he thought

of the girl’s elastic gait on the morning when he had first seen her  and

scrutinised once more the blooming face and admirably proportioned form

before him  then  shaking his head slowly  went on with his work 



‘perhaps i shall call this picture “the sleeping beauty ”’ he observed

after a pause  with apparent irrelevance   ‘you know the story  don’t

you ’



‘yes  but i don’t think it would be a good name   she was a princess who

went to sleep in a palace in the wood  and i am just i—in my working

dress  asleep in a cornfield ’



‘these are mere details ’ said he   ‘the main points of the story are the

same   she woke up all right  you know   you will wake up some day  too 

my beauty ’



he put such meaning into the words  and smiled down at her so oddly  that

she felt confused and uncomfortable   it was not that her pride was

wounded at the liberty he had taken in applying such a term to her  his

admiration was so evidently impersonal that it could not offend her  and 

moreover  his allusion to his wife and children had had a tranquillising

effect   but the man’s look and tone when he made this strange remark

filled her with vague disquietude  both betrayed a secret amusement

mingled with something like compassion   ‘she would wake up some day ’ he

said  but she did not want to wake up   she was quite happy—at least  as

happy as could be in her bereaved state—she asked nothing more from life 

it would be certainly more unpleasant than the reverse to discover that

life had surprises in store for her   but why need she trouble herself

about a prophecy so idly uttered  and by an absolute stranger 

nevertheless  she did trouble herself  not only throughout the remainder

of the time that the artist was completing his sketch  but frequently

afterwards 



‘you will wake up some day  my beauty ’  oh no  no  let her sleep on if

this placid contented existence were indeed sleep  let her dream away the

days in peace  until that time of awakening which would re unite her to

elias

    then  proud celinda  hope no more

    to be implor’d or woo’d 

    since by thy scorn thou dost restore

    the wealth my love bestow’d 

    and thy disdain too late shall find

    that none are fair but who are kind 



                                                           thomas stanley 



when the artist had gone away  after lingering some days longer to

complete his studies for the projected picture  the tenor of rosalie’s

existence flowed on as calmly as even she could desire   she made and

sold her butter  had her cheeses conveyed to mr  hardy’s establishment in

branston  superintended the harvesting of her potatoes and mangels  laid

in her winter store of oil cake  and fattened sundry turkeys and geese

for the christmas market 



early on a winter’s afternoon rosalie fiander might have been seen

walking slowly across the downs in the neighbourhood of isaac sharpe’s

farm   she carried a large basket  and every now and then paused to add

to the store of scarlet berries or shining evergreen which she was

culling from thicket and hedgerow for christmas decoration 



all at once she was surprised by hearing a step on the path behind her

and a man’s voice calling her name  and  turning  descried the tall and

somewhat ungainly person of andrew burge 



though it wanted yet a few days of christmas  that gentleman  who was of

a social turn of mind  had evidently begun to celebrate the festival  and

rosalie  gazing at him  was somewhat dismayed on perceiving the flushed

hilarity of his countenance and the devious gait by which he approached 



she paused reluctantly  however  and shook hands with him when he came

up 



‘i’ve been calling at your place  mrs  fiander ’ he observed  ‘to wish

you the compliments of the season ’



‘i am very much obliged to you ’ said rosalie   ‘the same to you  mr 

burge ’



‘ah ’ said the young man  rolling an amorous eye at her  ‘i was most

wishful  mrs  fiander  to give you my christmas greetings in person ’



‘you are very good ’ said she   ‘i wish you a merry christmas and a happy

new year   and now i think i must be moving home  for i am very busy

to day ’



‘allow me to escort you ’ urged andrew   ‘’t was a disapp’intment to me

not to find you at home   i am rej’iced to have overtaken you  and

anxious to prorogue the interview   there’s a season for condoliances and

a season for congratulations   this here is the time for congratulations 

and i am anxious  mrs  fiander  ma’am  to prorogue it ’



‘my work is waiting for me at home ’ said the young widow in alarm   ‘i

am afraid i shall have no time to attend to you  but  perhaps  some other

day—’



she broke off and began to walk away rapidly  but the uneven  lumbering

steps kept pace with hers 



‘christmas comes but once a year ’ remarked mr  burge  somewhat thickly 

‘’t is a joyful season—a season as fills a man’s ’eart with ’ope and

’appiness ’



this observation appearing to call for no rejoinder  rosalie let it pass

unnoticed except by a slight quickening of her pace  to no purpose 

however  for her unwelcome companion kept by her side 



‘christmas for ever ’ he ejaculated huskily  with an appropriate flourish

of his hat  instead of restoring it to its place after this sudden

display of enthusiasm  he continued to wave it uncertainly  not over his

own head  but over rosalie’s  leering the while in a manner which

materially increased her discomposure   all at once she saw that a sprig

of mistletoe was tucked into the band of mr  burge’s head gear  and

almost at the moment she made this discovery he lurched forward  so as to

bar her progress  and bent his face towards hers 



‘how dare you ’ cried rosalie  thrusting him from her with a vigorous

push  then  as he momentarily lost his equilibrium and staggered

backwards against the hedge  she fairly took to her heels and fled from

him at full speed  not towards her own home  but to isaac sharpe’s

premises 



‘o mr  sharpe ’ she cried breathlessly   ‘oh  oh  save me   he’s after

me ’



‘who’s arter you  my dear   why  you be a shakin’ same as an aspen tree 

what in the name o’ goodness has put you in such a state ’



‘oh  it’s—it’s that dreadful andrew burge   he overtook me on the downs

and tried to kiss me   i think he’s tipsy  and i know he’s running after

me ’



‘nay now  my dear  don’t ’ee take on so   he’ll not hurt ye here—i’ll see

to that   dang his impidence   tried to kiss ye  did he   that chap needs

to be taught his place ’



‘i’m sure he’s coming down the path now ’ cried rosalie  wringing her

hands   ‘oh  dear  if he does n’t come here i dare say he’ll go back to

the farm  and i shall find him there when i go home ’



‘now  don’t ’ee go on shakin’ and cryin’ so   don’t ye be so excited 

rosalie ’ said isaac  who was himself very red in the face and violently

perturbed   ‘come  i’ll walk home along of ye  and if i do find him there

i’ll settle him—leastways  if you’ll give me leave   ye don’t want to

have nothin’ more to say to ’en  do ye   very well  then  ’t will be easy

enough to get rid of ’en ’



so isaac sharpe  without pausing to pull a coat over his smock frock 

duly escorted mrs  fiander across the downs and home by the short cut 

and  as rosalie had surmised  susan greeted them on the threshold with

the pleasing information that mr  burge was waiting for her in the

parlour 



‘very good ’ said isaac   ‘leave ’en to me  my dear   jist you go to the

dairy  or up to your room  or anywheres ye like out o’ the road   i’ll

not be very slack in getting through wi’ this here job ’



he watched her until she had disappeared from view  and then suddenly

throwing open the parlour door shouted in stentorian tones to its

solitary occupant 



‘now then  you must get out o’ this ’



burge  who had been sitting in a somnolent condition before the fire 

woke up  and stared in surprise mingled with alarm at the white robed

giant who advanced threateningly towards him through the dusk 



‘why  what does this mean ’ he stammered 



‘what does this mean ’ repeated the farmer in thundering tones   ‘it

means that you’re a rascal  young fellow ’



and isaac qualified the statement with one or two specimens of ‘language’

of the very choicest kind 



‘what do you mean  eh ’ he pursued  standing opposite the chair where

andrew sat blinking  ‘by running arter young females on them there

lonesome downs  when you was not fit for nothin’ but a public bar 

frightenin’ her  and insultin’ her till she was very near took with a fit

on my doorstep   what do ye mean  ye villain  eh   if ye was n’t so drunk

that ye could n’t stand up to me for a minute i’d have ye out in that

there yard and i’d give ye summat ’



mr  burge shrank as far back in his chair as was compatible with a kind

of tipsy dignity  and inquired mildly 



‘why  what business is it of yours  mr  sharpe ’



‘it’s my business that i won’t have ’lias fiander’s widow insulted nor

yet put upon  nor yet bothered by folks as she don’t want to ha’ nothin’

to say to ’



‘mr  sharpe ’ protested andrew—‘mr  sharpe  i cannot permit such

interference   my intentions was honourable   i meant matrimony  and i

will not allow any stranger to come between this lady and me ’



‘ye meant matrimony  did ye ’ said isaac  exchanging his loud  wrathful

tone for one of withering scorn   ‘mrs  fiander does n’t mean matrimony 

though—not wi’ the likes o’ you   come  you clear out o’ this  and don’t

you never go for to show your ugly mug here again  or my cluster o’ five

will soon be no stranger to it  i promise you ’



he held up a colossal hand as he spoke  first extending the fingers in

illustration of his threat  and then clenching it into a redoubtable

fist 



andrew sat upright in the elbow chair  his expressionless eyes staring

stolidly at his assailant  but without attempting to move   through the

open door the sound of whispers and titters could have been heard had

either of the men been in a condition to notice such trivial matters 



‘now  then ’ repeated sharpe threateningly 



andrew burge drew himself up 



‘this contumacious behaviour  mr  sharpe  sir ’ he said  ‘has no effect

upon me whatever   my intentions is to make an equivocal offer of

marriage to mrs  fiander  and from her lips alone will i take my answer 

i shall sit in this chair ’ he continued firmly  ‘until the lady comes in

person to give me her responsory ’



‘you will  will ye ’ bellowed isaac   ‘ye be a goin’ to sit there  be ye 

ye bain’t  though   that there chair’s my chair i’d have ye know  and

i’ll soon larn ye who have got the right to sit in it ’



with that he lunged forward  thrusting the cluster of five so suddenly

into andrew’s face that that gentleman threw himself heavily backwards 

and the chair  being unprovided with castors  overbalanced  and fell

violently to the ground 



undeterred by the catastrophe and the peculiar appearance presented by

mr  burge’s flushed and dazed countenance as he stared helplessly

upwards  contemplating probably a thousand stars  isaac seized the chair

by the legs and began to drag it across the floor  bumping its occupant

unmercifully in his exertions   his own countenance was  indeed  almost

as purple in hue as andrew’s by the time he reached the door  which was

obligingly thrown open as he neared it  revealing sam belbin’s delighted

face   the alarmed countenances of the maids peered over his shoulder 

while a few manly forms were huddled together in the passage   mr 

sharpe’s extremely audible tones had attracted many eager listeners 

nothing so exciting had taken place at littlecomb since elias fiander’s

funeral 



‘here  you chaps ’ cried the farmer  still tugging violently at the

chair  and panting with his efforts  ‘here  come on  some on you   lend a

hand to get rid o’ this here carcase ’



nothing loath  the men sprang forward  and between them the chair with

its occupant was dragged out of the room and along the passage 



‘what’s he been a doin’ of ’ inquired sam with great gusto  as he dropped

his particular chair leg on the cobble stones in the yard 



‘never you mind what he’ve been a doin’ of ’ returned isaac 

straightening himself and wiping his brow   ‘get him out of that there

chair  and trot him off the premises—that’s what you ’ve a got to do ’



andrew burge was with some difficulty set on his legs  and after gazing

vacantly round him appeared to recover a remnant of his scattered senses 



‘i’ll summons you  mr  sharpe ’ he cried   ‘the liberties of the british

subject is not to be vi’lently interfered with   i leave this spot ’ he

added  looking round loftily but unsteadily  ‘with contumely ’



anyone who had subsequently seen sam and robert conducting the suitor to

the high road would have endorsed the truth of this remark  though mr 

burge  according to his custom  had merely used the first long word that

occurred to him without any regard to its appropriateness 



returning to the house  isaac went to the foot of the stairs and called

out rosalie’s name in a mildly jubilant roar 



‘come down  mrs  fiander  come down  my dear   he be gone  and won’t

never trouble you no more  i’ll answer for ’t ’



rosalie came tripping downstairs  smiling  in spite of a faintly alarmed

expression 



‘what a noise you did make  to be sure ’ she remarked  ‘and what a mess

the parlour is in ’



‘we did knock down a few things  i d’ ’low  when we was cartin’ ’en out

of this ’ returned isaac apologetically   ‘he was a settin’ in my chair 

and he up and told me to my face as he’d go on a settin’ there till he

seed ’ee—that were comin’ it a bit too strong ’



he was helping her as he spoke to pick up the scattered furniture  and to

restore the table cloth and books  which andrew had dragged down in

falling  to their places 



these tasks ended  he faced her with a jovial smile 



‘well ’ he said  ‘he won’t trouble you again  anyhow   there’s one o’

your coortin’ chaps a gone for good ’



‘i wish you could get rid of them all in the same way ’ said rosalie

gratefully  adding in a confidential tone  ‘there’s mr  wilson  now—he

keeps calling and calling  and he follows me about  and pays me

compliments—he is very tiresome ’



‘be he ’ returned the farmer with a clouded brow   ‘ah  and he bain’t a

chap for you to be takin’ notice on  nohow   i’d give ’en the sack if i

was you ’



‘why  you see  i don’t like to be rude  and he was kind about the pigs 

but i wish some one would drop him a hint that he is wasting his time in

dangling about me ’



she broke off suddenly  for at that moment the interested and excited

countenance of sam belbin appeared in the doorway  and  though he was a

favourite with his mistress  she did not see fit to discuss such intimate

affairs in his hearing 



the news of isaac sharpe’s encounter with young andrew burge soon flew

round the neighbourhood  evoking much comment  and causing constructions

to be placed upon the farmer’s motives which  if he had heard them  would

have sorely disquieted that good man 



‘he be a goin’ to coort widow fiander hisself  for certain ’ averred mrs 

paddock   ‘d’ ye mind how i did say that day as there was all the trouble

yonder at littlecomb—“how nice ” says i  “master did speak of her ”—d’ ye

mind   he were quite undone about her   “pore young creatur’ ” says he 

so feelin’ as he could   “d’ ye mind   mrs  belbin ” i said  says i 

“master be a very feelin’ man ”’



‘ah  i can mind as you said that ’ returned mrs  belbin  ‘but my sam he

d’ ’low as mrs  fiander would n’t so much as look at master   “not

another old man ” says he   and  mind ye ’ added mrs  belbin 

confidentially dropping her voice  ‘sam’s missus do think a deal o’ he ’



mrs  paddock folded her arms  and looked superciliously at her neighbour 



‘nay now ’ said she  ‘your sam ’ull find hisself mistook if he gets set

on sich a notion as that ’



‘what notion ’ returned the other innocently   ‘i never said nothin’

about no notion at all   you’ve a got such a suspectin’ mind  mrs 

paddock  there’s no tellin’ you a bit o’ news wi’out you up an’ take a

body’s character away ’



at this moment the impending hostilities between the two matrons were

averted by the advent of a third—mrs  stuckhey by name  wife of robert

stuckhey  who worked at littlecomb 



‘my ’usband did say ’ she remarked  negligently scratching her elbows 

‘as mr  sharpe seemed very intimate wi’ missus   “my dear ” he says to

her   ah  stuckhey d’ say as mr  sharpe do often call missus “my dear ”

and he did say as he seed ’en come walkin’ home wi’ her this arternoon 

quite lovin’ like  in a smock frock  jist the same as if he was in his

own place   “go upstairs  my dear ” says he—’



‘in his  smock frock  ’ interrupted mrs  paddock eagerly   ‘were it a new

smock frock  did mr  stuckhey say ’



‘very like it were ’ replied mrs  stuckhey  accommodatingly   ‘my master

he bain’t one as takes much notice  and if it had a been a old one he’d

scarce ha’ thought o’ mentionin’ it to me ’



‘then you may depend  mrs  belbin ’ cried mrs  paddock triumphantly  ‘as

master be a coortin’ o’ widow fiander   a new smock frock  ’t is the very

thing as a man like he ’ud wear when his thoughts was bent on sich

matters   i do mind as my father told me often how he did save an’ save

for eleven weeks to buy hisself a new smock to go a coortin’ my mother

in   ah  wages was terrible low then  and he were n’t a gettin’ above

seven shillin’ a week  but he did manage to put by a shillin’ out o’

that   the smock—it were a white ’un—did cost eleven shillin’  and he did

save eleven weeks   and  strange to say  when he and my mother did wed 

they did have eleven children ’



utterly routed by this incontrovertible testimony  mrs  belbin withdrew

to her own quarters  leaving the other two ragged heads bobbing together

in high enjoyment of the delectable piece of gossip 



before the morrow the entire village knew that farmer sharpe had arrived

at littlecomb with his arm round widow fiander’s waist  that he had

spoken to her in the tenderest terms  had avowed his intention of

hammering each and every one of her suitors  and had bought himself a

brand new and beautifully embroidered smock frock for the express purpose

of courting her in it 







chapter x





    disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes 

    misprising what they look on      



                                                              shakespeare 



though isaac sharpe did not consider himself bound to assist rosalie in

repelling the advances of mr  wilson  the auctioneer  the wish she had

expressed that someone would be kind enough to ‘drop a hint to him’ had

fallen upon other attentive and willing ears 



sam belbin had laid her words to heart  and only waited for an

opportunity of proving his good will by ridding her of a frequent and

unwelcome visitor 



his chance came at last  and he was quick to take advantage of it 



it was cheese day  and rosalie and her maids had prepared such a quantity

that their work was not  as usual  finished before dinnertime  and they

were still elbow deep in curds when mr  wilson chanced to look in 



sam was standing in the outer room  swilling out the great cheese vat

which had held that morning a hundred and eighty gallons of skim milk   a

wonderfully obliging fellow was sam  always ready to lend a hand here  to

do an odd job there  and so good tempered with it all   his mistress

could often see his smiling mouth open and ready to agree with whatever

remark he thought her likely to make long before she had spoken  and as

she liked contradiction as little as any of her sex her head man advanced

the more rapidly in her favour 



she was anything but gratified when mr  wilson appeared on the threshold

of the milk house  and after a brief greeting bent her head over her

mould and went on with her work 



‘always busy  mrs  fiander ’ remarked the visitor pleasantly   ‘’pon my

word  you ladies put us to shame sometimes   we men are idle creatures in

comparison with you ’



rosalie made no answer  and sam banged about the vat with his stiff brush

so energetically that he seemed bent on giving the lie to the

auctioneer’s words 



‘i am really quite curious to see how you set about your cheese making ’

pursued the latter in mellifluous tones   ‘should i be in your way  mrs 

fiander  if i was to step in and watch you ’



‘i am afraid you would n’t find it very amusing ’ responded rosalie

unwillingly   ‘of course  if you like   but it will really be most

uncomfortable for you   we are all in such a mess here 

sam’—irritably—‘what a din you do make with that tub ’



sam  who had tilted up the tub  the better apparently to scrub the

bottom  now let it go suddenly  sending a great portion of its contents

splashing across the floor in mr  wilson’s direction 



‘it be all the same ’ he remarked philosophically  ‘i were just a goin’

to swill out this here place ’



and with that he upset a little more of the steaming water upon the

floor  seized a stiff broom  and began to brush the soapy liquid towards

the door 



‘you might have waited a moment ’ commented his mistress  but she spoke

with a sweet smile  for she saw with the corner of her eye how hastily

mr  wilson had skipped out of the way  anxious to protect his shining

boots and immaculate leggings   ‘i really cannot invite you in now ’ she

added  turning to the visitor regretfully   ‘pray excuse the man’s

awkwardness ’  but as she spoke she smiled again on sam 



she related the anecdote with much gusto to isaac sharpe on the following

sunday  but he did not seem to appreciate it as much as she had expected 



‘that there wilson  he’s arter you too  i suppose   i would n’t have

anything to say to him if i was you   he bain’t steady enough to make a

good husband—racin’ an’ drinkin’  and sich like   ah  his poor wife  she

did n’t praise him  but she suffered  poor soul ’



‘gracious  mr  sharpe  i am sure you need n’t warn me   you know what my

views are  besides  i hate the man   i would n’t see him at all if he had

n’t—had n’t been rather obliging in a business way   but was n’t it

clever of sam to get rid of him like that ’



‘’ees ’ agreed the farmer dubiously  ‘but don’t ’ee go for to let ’en

take too much on hisself  my dear  else ye’ll be like to repent it   it

do never do to let these young fellows get sot up   keep ’en in his

place  mrs  fiander  don’t let ’en get presumptious ’



‘i’m sure he would never be that ’ she rejoined warmly   ‘poor sam  he’s

the humblest creature in the world   he goes about his work like—like a

machine ’



‘may be so ’ said isaac incredulously  ‘you know him best  i suppose  but

i jist thought i’d speak my mind out about him ’



rosalie frowned a little and said no more  but her faith in sam was not

diminished  and as time went on she grew to rely more and more on this

cheerful and obliging young fellow 



the gossiping anent the alleged courting of mrs  fiander by farmer sharpe

was not confined to littlecomb village  but soon spread to the more

important town of branston  with the immediate result of stirring up

sundry of the young men belonging to that place  who  after the

discomfiture of samuel cross  had deemed it prudent to relax for a time

in their attentions to the fascinating widow   so long as she had been

thought plunged in grief  these wooers of hers had been content to bide

their time  but when it became known that there was actually an avowed

suitor in the field  and one  moreover  to whom the lady had given

unequivocal tokens of confidence and good will  they resolved with one

accord to bestir themselves  lest the prize of which each thought himself

most deserving  might be secured by another 



before many days of the new year had passed rosalie found herself

absolutely besieged   samuel cross actually forced his way past the

unwilling susan into the parlour while rosalie was at tea  mr  wilson lay

in wait for her as she was emerging from church on christmas day  and

made his proposal in due form as he escorted her homewards   john hardy

inveigled the widow into the back parlour behind the shop  ostensibly to

discuss the sale of the blue vinneys  in reality to lay his hand and

heart at her feet 



rosalie said ‘no’ to one and all  and was astonished at the outburst of

indignation which her answer provoked  and at the keen sense of ill usage

under which every one of her suitors appeared to be labouring 



it was samuel cross who first alluded in rosalie’s hearing to the

prevalent belief that farmer sharpe was paying his court to her  and he

was somewhat taken aback by the unfeigned merriment which the suggestion

evoked 



‘you may laugh  mrs  fiander ’ he said  recovering himself after an

instant  ‘but people are not blind and deaf  and  though they may be

fooled to a certain extent by a lady  gentlemen of my profession find it

easy to put two and two together  ma’am   when a lady tells you she is

always engaged on a sunday  and shuts the door in the face of a person

who comes to make civil inquiries  one does n’t need to be extra clever

to guess that there must be some reason for it   and when the reason

turns out to be another gentleman  and when that gentleman takes upon

himself to assault another gentleman as was also desirous of paying his

respects in the same quarter  that  mrs  fiander  is what one may term

 primâ facie  evidence ’



whether the display of mr  cross’s learning had a sobering effect on mrs 

fiander  or whether she was suddenly struck by some serious thought  it

is certain that she ceased laughing at this juncture  and remained

pensive even after the rejected suitor had departed 



mr  wilson was harder to get rid of   he was so confident in the justice

of his claim  so pertinacious in reminding rosalie of her obligations

towards him with regard to the sales of the pigs—which piece of business

he perseveringly alluded to as ‘a delicate matter’—so persuaded 

moreover  of his own superiority to any of her other lovers  that she

finally lost patience and petulantly declared that if there were not

another man in the world she would not consent to marry him 



the auctioneer grew purple in the face  and suddenly changed his note —



‘if there was n’t another man in the world ’ he repeated sneeringly 

‘then there is another man   ha  it is n’t very hard to guess who   well 

tastes differ   if you like such a rough  common old chap better than a

gentleman doing a large and honourable business  i make you a present of

him  mrs  fiander  smock frock and all   ha  ha  he’ll soon have the pigs

back again when he’s master here  and all my labour and loss of time will

have been thrown away   not that i grudge the sacrifice ’ cried mr 

wilson in a melting tone   ‘no  far be it from me to grudge the

sacrifice   the ladies have always found an easy prey in me  and when i

think of the far greater sacrifice which a young and lovely woman is

prepared to make upon the altar of matrimony—a sacrifice which she will

repent too late—i am rejooced to silence ’



here mr  wilson thumped his breast and cast a last languishing look at

the young widow  who appeared  however  to be absorbed in her own

reflections 



he talked on in spite of his last assertion until they reached rosalie’s

door  where  waking as if from a dream  she extended her hand to him 



‘good bye ’ she said   ‘there is no use in talking about it any more  mr 

wilson  my mind is made up ’



the auctioneer extended his hand dramatically in the direction of the

empty pigsties 



‘well  mrs  fiander ’ he cried  ‘if the inspector of nuisances visits

your premises you will only have yourself to thank ’



‘meanwhile ’ retorted rosalie with some acerbity  ‘as it might be a

little difficult to send for him to day  i should be glad if the nuisance

who is now occupying my premises would take himself off ’



she went into the house with a flushed face  but seemed more thoughtful

than annoyed during the remainder of the day 



it was  however  with unmixed vexation that she perused  on the morning

following her rejection of young john hardy  a document signed by the

firm  which ran thus —



    ‘to mrs  fiander 



    madam — re  blue vinney cheeses —we regret to inform you that we can

    no longer allow our premises to be used as a storehouse for these

    unsaleable articles   in the three months during which  in order to

    oblige you  we have placed our establishment at your disposal  we

    have only found one purchaser for a small portion of the goods in

    question  as you will see per statement copied from our books and

    enclosed herewith    under these circumstances we are returning to

    you to day as many of the cheeses as the carrier’s cart can convey 

    and we shall be obliged by your removing the remainder at your

    earliest convenience 



                                          we are  madam  yours obediently 

                                                            ‘hardy   son ’



the enclosed ‘statement’ testified to the purchase by one margaret savage

of ¾ lb  blue vinney cse at 5¾ d   = 4 d    which sum had been credited

to mrs  fiander’s account 



rosalie gave a little gasp  and tears of vexation sprang to her eyes 



‘they just want to spite me ’ she said   ‘of course the cheeses are

hardly fit for use yet—they can’t have even tried to dispose of them 

they simply pretended to sell them so as to entrap me  and now they are

throwing them back on my hands before i have time to think what to do

with them   that odious john hardy   mean spirited wretch—it is all his

doing ’



even as she thus cogitated there was a rattling of wheels without  and

the carrier’s cart drew up with a flourish at the door 



‘please  ma’am ’ cried susan  thrusting in her head  ‘mr  smith be here

with ever so many cheeses as he says hardys are sending back  and there’s

sixteen and eightpence to pay  and he says  ma’am  will you please send

the men to unload them at once ’



‘call sam ’ said her mistress in a strangled voice   ‘tell him to come at

once with two or three of the others  and to take the cheeses carefully

upstairs ’



‘why  the cheese room be a’most full  ma’am   i doubt there’ll not be

much room for them there   we was waitin’  you know  till christmas had

gone over a bit to send the last load to town ’



‘pile them up in the dairy  then  for the present   well  why don’t you

go ’ she cried  irritably  as the girl remained staring at her   ‘make

the men get to work at once while i find my purse ’



as she came down from her room  purse in hand  she observed through the

staircase window the blank faces of sam and his underlings  as the

carrier tossed the cheeses to them from the cart  grinning the while as

though at some excellent joke   she stamped her foot  and caught her

breath with a little angry sob   she had been so proud in despatching to

branston load after load of these fine round cheeses  she had often

congratulated herself on the wisdom and cleverness of this expedient of

hers—and now to have them ignominiously thrown back at her without having

even disposed of one—to be turned into a laughing stock for her own folks

as well as for the whole town of branston  to be actually made to pay for

the ill success of her experiment   rosalie was as a rule open handed and

generous enough  but the disbursal of this particular

sixteen and eightpence caused her a pang of almost physical anguish 



half an hour later  when the carrier had departed and the men returned to

their work  she entered the dairy  and stood gazing with clasped hands

and a melancholy countenance at the heaps of despised blue vinneys which

were piled up on every side 



to her presently came sam belbin  his arms dangling limply by his sides 

his expression duly composed to sympathetic gloom 



‘oh  sam ’ exclaimed rosalie in a heartbroken tone  pointing tragically

to the nearest yellow mound 



‘i would n’t take on  i’m sure  mum ’ responded sam with a ghastly smile 

‘nay now  i would n’t take on   ’t was very ill done o’ mr  hardy—so

everybody do say  but he’s that graspin’—he never do care for sellin’ a

bit o’ cheese to poor folks—’t is all bacon  bacon wi’ he   “don’t ’ee go

for to fill your stummicks wi’ that there ’ard cheese ” i ’ve a heard him

say myself   “buy a bit o’ bacon as ’ull stand to ye hot or cold ”’



‘bacon ’ ejaculated rosalie with a note of even deeper woe   then 

pointing to the cheeses again  she groaned  ‘oh  sam  was it worth while

getting rid of the pigs—for this ’



‘dear heart alive  mum ’ responded belbin  plucking up his courage  and

speaking more cheerfully   ‘mr  hardy bain’t the only grocer in branston 

there be a many more as ’ud be proud an’ glad to sell them cheeses for

ye ’



‘no  no   why  the story must be all over the town by now—no one will

look at them in branston   everyone will know that mr  hardy packed them

back to me   no  if i sell them at all i must send them away somewhere—to

dorchester  perhaps ’



‘well  and that ’ud be a good notion  mum ’ commented belbin   ‘you’d get

a better price for them there  i d’ ’low   lard   at dorchester the blue

vinney cheeses do go off like smoke ’



‘there is always a sale for them there  to be sure ’ said rosalie 

somewhat less lugubriously 



‘and our own horses and carts ’ud take them there in less than no time ’

pursued sam  more and more confidently   ‘things have just fell out

lucky   it be a goin’ to take up to night  and i d’ ’low there’ll be some

sharpish frostiss—’t will just exercise the horses nicely  to get them

roughed and make ’em carry them cheeses to dorchester—’t will be the very

thing as ’ull do them good   and it’ll cost ye nothing ’ he added

triumphantly 



‘well  sam  you are a good comforter ’ cried his mistress  brightening up

under the influence of his cheerfulness   ‘’t is a blessing  i am sure 

to have someone about one who does n’t croak ’



she turned to him as she spoke with one of her radiant smiles—a smile 

however  which very quickly vanished  for sam’s face wore a most peculiar

expression 



‘why  my dear ’ he cried  casting an ardent look upon her  ‘i be main

glad to hear ye say so   i’d ax nothin’ better nor to be about ye always 

an’ i’d comfort an’ do for ye so well as i could   ’t is a thing ’ he

added  with modest candour  ‘as i’ve a had in my mind for some time  but

i did n’t like to speak afore   i was n’t sure as ye’d relish the notion 

but now as you’ve a hinted so plain—’



rosalie had averted her face for a moment  but as he advanced towards her

with extended arm  she flashed round upon him a glance which suddenly

silenced him 



he remained staring at her with goggling eyes and a dropping jaw during

the awful pause which succeeded 



he heaved a sigh of relief  however  when she at last broke silence  for

she spoke calmly  and her words seemed innocuous enough 



‘is that your coat hanging up behind the door ’



‘yes  mum ’ responded sam  no longer the lover but the very humble

servant 



‘go and get it then   your cap  i think  is on the table ’



she fumbled in her pocket for a moment  and presently drew forth her

purse  from which she counted out the sum of fourteen shillings   her

eyes had a steely glitter in them as she fixed them on sam 



‘here are your week’s wages ’ she said   ‘take them  and walk out of this

house ’



‘mum ’ pleaded sam piteously   ‘missus— ’



‘go out of this house ’ repeated rosalie  pointing mercilessly to the

door  ‘and never let me see your face again   out of my sight ’ she added

quickly  as he still hesitated 



sam’s inarticulate protests died upon his lips  and he turned and left

her  rosalie looking after him with gleaming eyes until his figure was

lost to sight

isaac sharpe  receiving no answer to his knock  walked straight into the

parlour   the room was dark save for the smouldering glow of the fire 

and it was some time before he discovered rosalie’s figure huddled up in

elias’s chair 



‘why  what be to do ’ he inquired  stooping over her 



‘oh  mr  sharpe ’ returned she  with a strangled sob  ‘i have had such a

day—i have been so insulted   oh  how shall i ever forget it   what can i

have done to bring about such a thing ’



‘come ’ cried the farmer  much alarmed  ‘whatever is it  my dear   out

wi’ it  and let’s have some light to see ourselves by ’



with that he seized the poker and stirred the logs on the hearth  until

they flared up with a brightness almost painful to rosalie’s aching eyes 

he saw the traces of tears upon her flushed face  and his concern

increased 



‘i heard ye was in trouble again ’ he said  ‘and i thought i’d look

in—them cheeses as ye’ve been a making of ever since midsummer is back on

your hands  they tell me ’



‘yes ’ said rosalie faintly   ‘there are piles and piles of them in the

dairy  and mr  hardy wrote a most ill natured letter about them  and

everyone in the place will think me a fool   but it is n’t that i mind so

much—i shall sell those cheeses somewhere  i suppose  and i know mr 

hardy only sent them back out of spite because i would n’t marry john—’



‘ah ’ put in isaac  interested  ‘john hardy axed ye  did he   and you

would n’t have ’en ’



‘of course not ’ she returned petulantly 



‘well  mrs  f  ’ said isaac  leaning forward in his chair  and speaking

solemnly  ‘ye mid ha’ done worse nor take him   ’t is in my mind ’ he

went on emphatically  ‘as soon or late ye’ll have to take a second   but 

tell me  what was it as upset ye so much to day ’



‘i am almost ashamed to say it   sam belbin—you know sam  that common lad

that i made cowman out of pure kindness and because i thought him

faithful—he—he—that lout  has actually dared to make love to me ’



‘well  now ’ commented isaac  nodding 



‘are you not amazed   did you ever hear of such impudence   he dared to

call me “my dear”  and he seemed to think that  i   his mistress  had

actually encouraged him   he said something about my dropping a hint 

but i soon let him see what i thought of him   i packed him off on the

moment ’



‘did ye ’ said isaac   ‘well  my dear—i beg pardon—mrs  fiander  i should

say—’



‘oh  of course ’ she put in quickly  ‘i don’t mind  your  saying  my

dear —’t is a very different matter ’



‘well  as i was a sayin’ ’ pursued the farmer  ignoring these niceties 

‘i bain’t altogether so very much surprised   i’ve a heard some queer

talk about you and sam belbin—only this very day i’ve a heard queer

talk—and  to say the truth  that were the reason why i looked in this

arternoon—i thought it best not to wait till sunday   i’m not one to

meddle  but i thought it only kind to let ye know what folks in the

village be sayin’ ’



‘mr  sharpe ’—and her eyes positively blazed—‘do you mean to tell me that

people know me so little as to gossip about me and that low fellow ’



‘ah  my dear ’ cried isaac  catching the infection of her excitement 

‘there’s no knowing what folks do say—they be ready to believe any

scandelious thing   why  bithey did actually tell me ’t is common talk o’

the village as you and me be a goin’ to make a match of it ’



rosalie  who had been leaning forward in her chair  suddenly sank back 

she drew a long breath  and then said in a very small voice 



‘well  isaac  i believe it will have to come to that ’



not even sam belbin  withering under his mistress’s scornful gaze  had

stared at her with such blank dismay as that now perceptible on farmer

sharpe’s face 



rosalie covered her own with both hands  but presently dropped them

again 



‘everything points to it ’ she said firmly   ‘you see yourself things

cannot go on as they are   i find i can’t manage the men—’



here her voice broke  but she pursued after a minute  ‘even the work

which i am competent to undertake has not succeeded   elias would be

sorely grieved to see everything going wrong like this  he who was such a

good man of business—always so regular and particular ’



‘ah ’ groaned isaac  ‘i d’ ’low  it ’ud very near break his heart ’



‘there must be a master here ’ went on rosalie   ‘even you were forced to

own just now that i ought to marry again ’



‘’ees ’ agreed isaac unwillingly  ‘oh  ’ees  it ’ud be a very good thing 

but i—’



he broke off  gazing at her with an expression almost akin to terror 



‘do you suppose for a moment ’ she cried with spirit  ‘that i would ever

consent to put a stranger in my dear elias’s place   could you—you who

have been his friend so long  bear to see one of the branston

counter jumpers master here   i wonder at you  isaac sharpe ’



‘nay now ’ protested the farmer  ‘i did n’t say i wished no such thing 

mrs  fiander   i said ’t was my opinion as you’d be forced to take a

second  and you might do worse nor think o’ john hardy ’



‘pray  is n’t he a counter jumper ’ interrupted rosalie vehemently 



‘well  there’s others besides he ’ returned sharpe weakly 



‘whom would you choose  then ’ cried she   ‘wilson  to drink  and race

away my husband’s hard earned money   andrew burge  perhaps  whom you

drove out of this house with your own hands   or that little ferret faced

samuel cross—he’d know how to manage a dairy farm  would n’t he   you’d

like to see him strutting about  and giving orders here   i tell you what

it is  isaac sharpe  if you have no respect for dear elias’s memory  you

should be glad that i have ’



‘who says i have n’t respect for ’lias’s memory ’ thundered isaac  now

almost goaded into a fury   ‘i’ve known ’en a deal longer nor you have 

widow fiander  and there’s no one in this world as thought more on him 

all i says is—i bain’t a marryin’ man—’lias knowed i were n’t never a

marryin’ man   i don’t believe ’ added isaac  with an emphatic thump on

the table  ‘i don’t believe as if ’lias were alive he’d expect it of me ’



‘but he’s dead  you see ’ returned rosalie with a sudden pathetic change

of tone—‘he’s dead  and that is why everything is going wrong   i should

n’t think of making a change myself if i did n’t feel it was the only

thing to do   you loved elias  you knew his ways  you would carry on the

work just as he used to do—it would n’t be like putting a stranger in his

place   i would n’t do it if i could help it ’ she added  sobbing  ‘but i

think we—we should both try to do our duty by elias ’



isaac  visibly moved  rolled his eyes towards her and heaved a mighty

sigh 



‘of course  if you put it that way ’ he began  and then his courage

failed him  and be became once more mute 



‘it would n’t be such a bad thing for you  mr  sharpe ’ went on rosalie

faintly   ‘’t is a very fine farm  and a good business   it would be

convenient for you to work the two farms together   you’d have quite a

large property—and this is a very comfortable house ’



‘ah ’ agreed isaac  ‘’t is a good house  but i have n’t no need for two

houses   i’m content wi’ the one where i were born ’



‘oh  but that won’t do at all ’ cried rosalie with sudden animation  ‘you

would have to live here—the object of my marrying you would be that you

should live here ’



‘i’ve a lived in my own house ever sin’ i were born ’ said the farmer

obstinately  ‘and when a man weds he takes his wife to live wi’ him ’



‘not when the wife has got the best house of the two ’ retorted mrs 

fiander 



‘a man can’t live in two houses ’ asserted isaac  adding  after a pause 

‘what would ye have me do with mine  then ’



‘you could put your head man to live in it ’ returned she  ‘paying you

rent  of course   or you could let it to somebody else—you would make

money in that way ’



one by one isaac’s entrenchments were being carried  no resource remained

open to him but to capitulate or to take flight   he chose the latter

alternative 



‘’t is not a thing as a body can make up his mind to in a hurry ’ he

said   ‘i must think it over  mrs  fiander ’



then before she could make the sharp retort which had risen to her lips

he had darted to the door 



as it closed behind him rosalie sprang to her feet  and began to pace

hastily about the room   what had she done   she had actually in so many

words made an offer of marriage to isaac sharpe—and she was not quite

sure of being accepted   there was the rub   elias was an old man  yet he

had wooed her  in her homeless  penniless condition  with a certain

amount of ardour   in her widowhood she had been courted  doubtless as

much on account of her wealth as of her beauty  but certainly with no

lack of eagerness   and now  when she had turned with affectionate

confidence to this old friend  and practically laid herself  her good

looks  and good fortune at his feet  he had promised unwillingly to think

it over   it was not to be endured—she would send him to the right about

on his return  let his decision be what it might   but then came the

sickening remembrance of the failures and humiliations which had attended

her unassisted enterprises  the importunities of distasteful

suitors—worst of all  the confident leer on sam belbin’s face   great

heavens   what a miserable fate was hers   she dared not so much as trust

a servant but he must needs try to take advantage of her unprotected

condition 



the lamp was lit and tea set forth  but rosalie left it untasted upon the

table   she was still pacing restlessly about the room when isaac walked

in  this time without any preliminary knock 



he closed the door behind him and advanced towards the young woman  his

face wearing a benign if somewhat sheepish smile 



‘i be come to tell you ’ he said  ‘as i’ve come round to the notion ’



he paused  beaming down at her with the air of a man who was making an

indubitably pleasant announcement  and rosalie  who was gifted with a

very genuine sense of humour  could not for the life of her help

laughing 



‘’ees ’ repeated isaac valiantly   ‘i’ve a comed round to the notion   i

was al’ays a bit shy o’ materimony  by reason o’ the cat and dog life as

my mother and father did lead  but i d’ ’low as i’ve no need to be

fearful about you   you’re made different  my dear  and ye’ve been a good

wife to ’lias   what’s more ’ he went on cheerfully  ‘as i was a thinkin’

to myself  ’t is n’t same as if i was to go and put myself in the wrong

box  so to speak  by beggin’ and prayin’ of ye to have me  then ye mid

very well cast up at me some day if i was n’t  satisfied  wi’ the

bargain   but when a young woman comes and axes a man as a favour to

marry her it be a different story  bain’t it ’



rosalie stopped laughing and glanced at him indignantly 



‘if that’s the way in which you look at it  mr  sharpe ’ she said  ‘i

think we had better give up the idea   how dare you ’ she burst out

suddenly—‘how dare you tell me to my face that i asked you as a favour 

i am not the kind of person to pray and beseech you   you know as well as

i do that other people are ready to fall on their knees if i but hold up

a finger ’



‘ah  a good few of them are ’ agreed isaac dispassionately  ‘but ye don’t

want ’em  ye see   well  and at the first go off  when i was took by

surprise  so to speak  i thought i did n’t want you   not as i’ve any

personal objections to you ’ he added handsomely  ‘but because i never

reckoned on changing my state   but now  as i’ve a thought it over  i’m

agreeable  my dear ’



rosalie remained silent  her eyes downcast  her hands nervously clasping

and unclasping each other 



‘i’m willin’ ’ he went on  ‘to do my dooty by ’lias and my dooty by you 

rosalie   you’ve been a good wife to he  and ye’ll be the same to me 

i’ve no doubt ’



he paused  passing his hand meditatively over his grizzled locks and

probably comforting himself with the reflection that in this case at

least there would be no need to supply himself with such a box as that so

often dolefully shown to him by his father 



‘i want to do my duty by elias ’ said the poor young widow at last  in a

choked voice  ‘but i don’t want you to sacrifice yourself  since you feel

it is a sacrifice   if you hate me so much don’t marry me  isaac ’ she

added passionately 



‘lard  my dear  who ever said i hated ’ee   far from it   i do like ’ee

very much  i’ve liked ’ee from the first   ’lias knowed i liked ’ee   say

no more about a sacrifice  it bain’t no sacrifice to speak on   i was

real upset to see how bad you was a gettin’ on  an’ it’ll be a comfort to

think as i can look arter you  and look arter the place   you and me was

al’ays the best o’ friends  and we’ll go on bein’ the best o’ friends

when we are man and wife   i can’t say no fairer than that ’



he stretched out his large brown palm  and rosalie laid her cold fingers

in it  and the compact was concluded by a silent hand shake 



then isaac  who was a practical man  pointed out to rosalie that her tea

was growing cold  and remarked placidly that he would smoke a bit of a

pipe by the fire while she partook of it 



as she approached the table and began tremulously to fill her cup he drew

forward a chair and sat down 



rosalie glanced round at him and started  the new era had already begun 

isaac was sitting in elias’s chair

one lovely sparkling april day a man was slowly pushing his bicycle up a

certain steep incline which is situated a little way out of dorchester 

and which is known as yellowham hill 



the road climbed upwards between woods  the banks on either side being

surmounted by a dense growth of rhododendrons and gorse  the latter in

full bloom  its brilliant yellow contrasting with the glossy dark leaves

of the bushes behind  which were already covered with a myriad of buds 

and the little bronze crooks of the bracken curling upwards through the

moss beneath 



the long spring day wanted yet some hours of its close  but already

delicious spicy odours came forth from the woods  which spoke of falling

dew  and the birds were making mysterious rustlings in the boughs  as

though preparing to go to roost 



the young man paused every now and then to draw a long breath  and to

look round him with evident delight 



‘this is good ’ he said to himself once   ‘this is fairyland—the place is

full of magic ’  then a sudden change came over his face  and he added 

‘it is better than fairyland—it is home ’



he was a pleasant looking young fellow  with a handsome intelligent face

and a tall well knit figure   he had grey eyes  very alert and keen in

their expression  and when he smiled his face lit up in an unexpected and

attractive way   his complexion was browner than might have been looked

for in connection with his hair  which was not very dark  and he had a

certain wideawake air as of one who had seen many men and things 



he had almost reached the crest of the hill when his glance  sweeping

appreciatively over the curving bank at the turn of the road  rested upon

a woman’s figure amid the tangle of sunlit green and gold which crowned

it 



rosalie fiander—who would be rosalie fiander for some three months

longer  it having been agreed between her and isaac that their marriage

should not take place till her year’s widowhood was completed—had halted

here on her return to branston  after a flying business visit to

dorchester 



these yellowham woods had been much loved by her during her childhood 

and she had yielded to the temptation of alighting from the gig to spend

a few minutes in what had once been to her a very paradise 



nigger was placidly cropping the grass at a little distance from her  and

she had been on her way to re enter the vehicle  when she had paused for

a last glance round 



she had marked  at first idly  then with some interest  the figure which

was toiling up the hill  feeling somewhat embarrassed when she discovered

on its nearer approach that she was herself the object of a somewhat

unusual scrutiny   the grey eyes which looked at her so intently from out

of the brown face had a very peculiar mixture of expressions   there was

curiosity in them and admiration—to that she was accustomed—but there was

something more  a wonder  an almost incredulous delight   thus might a

man look upon the face of a very dear friend whom he had not expected to

see—thus almost might he meet the sweetheart from whom he had been parted

for years 



as he approached the bank he slackened his pace  and presently came to a

standstill immediately beneath rosalie’s pinnacle of moss grown earth 



they remained face to face with each other for a moment or two  rosalie

gazing down  fascinated  at the man’s eyes  in which the joyful wonder

was growing ever brighter   rousing herself at last with an effort  and

colouring high  she turned and hastened along the crest of the bank until

she came to the gig  descended  rapidly gathered up the reins  and

mounted into the vehicle 



seeing that the stranger  though he had begun to walk slowly on 

continued to watch her  and being  besides  annoyed and confused at her

own temporary embarrassment  she jerked the reins somewhat sharply  and

touched up nigger with the whip   the astonished animal  unaccustomed to

such treatment  started off at a brisk pace  and the gig rattled down the

steep incline with a speed which would have filled its late owner with

horror 



the disaster which he would certainly have prophesied was not long in

coming   nigger’s legs were not quite on a par with his mettle  and

presently  stumbling over a loose stone  he was unable to recover

himself  and dropped fairly and squarely on both knees 



he was up in an instant  but rosalie  jumping out of the cart  and

running to his head  uttered a cry of anguish   through the white patches

of dust which testified to nigger’s misfortune she saw blood trickling 

a moment later rapid footsteps were heard descending the hill  and the

bicyclist came to her assistance 



bending forward  he carefully examined nigger’s knees  and then turned to

rosalie  the curious expression which had so puzzled and annoyed her

having completely vanished and given place to one of respectful concern 



‘don’t be frightened ’ he said  ‘it is not much—barely skin deep—i doubt

if there will be any marks ’



‘he has never been down before ’ said she tearfully   ‘poor nigger   good

old fellow   i should n’t have driven you so fast down the hill ’



‘his legs should be attended to at once ’ said the stranger practically 

‘have you far to go ’



‘oh yes—sixteen miles   to branston ’



he darted a keen glance at her 



‘branston ’ he echoed   ‘i am going there myself to morrow  or rather i

am going to a place about a mile this side of it ’



‘well  i  too  stop a little this side of the town ’ said rosalie   ‘but

poor nigger will never get so far   what am i to do   i must get home

to night ’



‘there is a village a mile or so from here ’ observed the young man   ‘i

think your best plan would be to leave the horse at the inn there   they

would probably lend you another to take you home   if you will get into

the trap i will lead the horse slowly back ’



‘oh no  i will walk ’ cried rosalie  ‘i can lead him myself ’ she added

diffidently   ‘i don’t like to take you out of your way—besides  you have

your bicycle   i suppose you are going to dorchester ’



‘i can go to dorchester any time ’ returned he   ‘’t is merely a fancy of

mine that takes me there   i’ve a wish to see the old place again  having

been away from it for ten years   but i am really on my way to visit my

uncle   if you know branston  i dare say you have met him   he lives near

littlecomb village  at a place called the down farm ’



‘mr  isaac sharpe ’ ejaculated rosalie   ‘indeed  i do know him   i live

next door to him ’



she broke off  not deeming it necessary to disclose  on so short an

acquaintance  her peculiar relations with the person in question 



‘good ’ cried the young man gaily   ‘it is strange our meeting like this 

i am richard marshall  his nephew   you live next door to him  you say ’

he added  with a puzzled look  ‘then you must be—you are— ’



‘i am mrs  fiander ’ returned she   ‘you remember elias fiander  of

littlecomb farm ’



‘of course i do  and i used to know his wife ’



‘oh  you have been so long away that a great many changes have taken

place   i was elias fiander’s third wife ’



‘was ’ cried he 



‘yes ’ said rosalie blushing  she knew not why   ‘my dear husband died

last july ’



the look of blank dismay which had overspread the young man’s face gave

way to an expression of relief  but he made no reply 



rosalie took hold of the nearest rein  turned nigger round  and began to

lead him slowly up the hill again 



‘i can really manage quite well ’ she said  somewhat stiffly 



‘i must see you out of your difficulties ’ returned the other with quiet

determination  and he too began to retrace his steps  pausing a moment at

the crest of the hill to repossess himself of his bicycle  which he had

left propped against the bank 



‘i will ride on to the village ’ he said  ‘and make arrangements about

leaving your horse there and getting a fresh one   it will save time  and

there is none to spare if you want to get home before dusk ’



he raised his cap  mounted  and disappeared before rosalie had time to

protest 



indeed  she was glad enough of richard marshall’s helpful company when

she presently arrived at the black horse inn  where  in spite of the

framed poetical effusion which hung beneath the sign  and which testified

to the merits of the establishment  there was some difficulty in

procuring accommodation and attention for poor nigger  and even greater

in finding a substitute   in fact  the only animal available proved to be

a huge rawboned three year old  who was with great difficulty persuaded

to enter the shafts of the gig  and who  when harnessed  tilted up the

vehicle in such a peculiar manner that rosalie shrank back in alarm 



‘he does n’t look safe ’ she faltered  ‘and i’m quite sure that boy is

n’t capable of driving him   i have been shaken by the fright  i suppose 

for i feel quite unnerved ’



‘i will drive you ’ said richard  with decision  waving aside the lad who

had been appointed charioteer and who now began to assert his perfect

competence to perform the task   ‘i guess i can manage most things in the

way of horseflesh  and in any case i intended to go to my uncle’s

to morrow ’



‘oh no  i could n’t think—’ rosalie was beginning  when he interrupted

her eagerly 



‘nothing will be easier  i assure you  my bag is here  strapped on to my

bicycle   i meant to take my uncle by surprise—he does n’t know i am in

england   you can send back the horse to morrow—even if you took the lad 

it would be difficult for him to return to night   my bicycle can stay

here until i send for it or fetch it   perhaps i had better get in first 

mrs  fiander  to keep this wild animal quiet  while you get up   hand

over the reins here—that’s it  hold on by his head till the lady mounts 

put that machine of mine in a dry place  will you   now then  mrs 

fiander  give me your hand   whoa  boy   steady   there we are—let go ’



he laid the whip lightly on the animal’s back  and they were off before

rosalie had had time to protest or to demur 



the long legs of the three year old covered the ground in a marvellous

manner  and with that tall masterful figure by her side she could feel no

fear   indeed the sensation of swinging along through the brisk air was

pleasant enough  though she felt a little uncomfortable at the thought of

the astonishment which her arrival in such company would produce at home 

and she was  moreover  not quite certain if she relished being thus

peremptorily taken possession of by the new comer   rosalie was used to

think and act for herself and it was quite a new experience to her to

have her will gainsaid and her objections overborne  even in her own

interests   but  after all  the man was isaac’s nephew  and no one could

find fault with her for accepting his assistance   in a few months’ time

she would be his aunt—perhaps he would then allow her wishes to have more

weight   she smiled to herself as she glanced up at him—what would he say

if she told him the relationship which he would shortly bear to her   he

would be her nephew   how ridiculous it seemed   he must be some years

older than she was  there were firm lines in that brown face  and the

hands looked capable and strong  as if they had accomplished plenty of

work 



when they reached yellowham hill once more and began to descend at a

foot’s pace  richard broke silence 



‘i have seen and done a good many things in the course of my travels  but

i have never come across so beautiful a spot as this  and none of my

adventures have been so curious as the one which introduced me to you ’



‘really ’ said rosalie drily  ‘i cannot see that there was anything so

very extraordinary in it   even if nigger had not had this accident we

should have been certain to meet while you are staying at mr  sharpe’s ’



‘i wonder ’ said the young man  speaking half to himself and half to

her—‘i wonder if i should have preferred to meet you first in your own

fields—in a cornfield   but the corn  of course  will not be ripe for

months to come   no  on the whole i am content   i said to myself when i

was climbing the hill  “there is magic in this place ” and i felt it was

home ’



‘i don’t know what you mean ’ said rosalie   ‘what can it matter where

one first meets a new acquaintance  and why should it be in a cornfield ’



‘i saw you first in a cornfield ’ said he 



‘but surely you were not in england last harvest time ’ she cried   ‘what

are you talking about   you have only just said that you would like to

 have met  me first in a cornfield  which proves—what is true—that you

have never seen me before ’



‘i have seen you before ’ he murmured in a low voice 



‘nonsense  nonsense ’ she cried sharply  ‘you must have dreamt it ’



‘yes—i did dream—about you ’ he owned  glancing at her  and once more

that curious look of wondering joy stole over his face 



rosalie drew a little away from him in a displeasure which he was quick

to observe 



‘i will explain some day ’ he said  looking down at her with a smile

which disarmed her  and then  having reached the bottom of the hill  he

chirruped to the horse  and they sped along once more at an exhilarating

pace 



by and by he began to talk about his uncle  speaking of him with such

evident affection that the heart of the future mrs  sharpe warmed to him 

her grateful regard for isaac had increased during their four months’

betrothal   indeed  it could not have been otherwise  he was so placid 

and good natured  and obliging   moreover  he took a lot of trouble off

her hands  for he had assumed the management of the farm immediately

after their engagement   no one could cavil at this arrangement  it was

natural that the man who was so shortly to be master should at once take

over the control of affairs   even the gossips of the neighbourhood could

make no ill natured comments  one and all  indeed  agreeing that it was

pretty behaviour on the part of the widow fiander to postpone the wedding

till after the year was out 



so rosalie listened  well pleased  while richard spoke of isaac’s past

generosity to him and his mother  of the high esteem in which he held

him  and of his desire to spend a few weeks in his company before going

out into the world afresh 



‘perhaps i ought to tell him that i am going to marry his uncle ’ thought

rosalie  and then she dismissed the notion   let isaac make the

announcement himself  she felt rather shy about it—and possibly richard

marshall might not like the idea 



she began to question him  instead  anent his past achievements and

future prospects  and heard with astonishment and concern that the young

man had not only failed to make his fortune in the distant lands he had

visited  but had come back in some ways poorer than he had set out 



‘only in some things  though ’ he said   ‘i reckon i am richer on the

whole ’



‘how are you poorer and how are you richer ’ queried rosalie 



‘i am poorer in pocket  my uncle sent me out with a nice little sum to

start me in life   ah  as i tell you  he’s a first rate old chap   he

could n’t have done more for me if i had been his son   well  that’s gone

long ago  but i have come back richer all the same—rich in experience 

for one thing   i have seen a lot and learnt a lot   i educated myself

out there in more ways than one   dear old dorset holds a very fine place

on the map of england  yet ’t is but a tiny corner of the world after

all ’



as she listened there came to rosalie a sudden inexplicable envy   she

had never been out of her native county—she had never wanted to travel

beyond its borders  but for a moment the thought struck her that it might

be a fine and desirable thing to see the world 



‘i wonder ’ she said tartly  for her irritation at this discovery

recoiled on its unsuspicious cause—‘i wonder  mr  marshall  you should

care to come back to dorset since you have such a poor opinion of it 

why did n’t you settle out there ’



‘out where ’ he inquired with a smile   ‘i have tried to settle in a good

many places   i was in a newspaper office in new york—it was while i was

there that i did most in the way of educating myself—and then i went to

san francisco  and then to texas   i’ve been pretty well over the states 

in fact  and i’ve been to mexico and brazil and canada   i might have

done well in several places if i could have made up my mind to stick to

the job in hand—but i could n’t   something was drawing me all the

time—drawing me back to england—drawing me home  so that at last i felt i

must come back ’



‘and what will you do now ’ she inquired with curiosity 



‘oh ’ he cried  drawing a deep breath  ‘i must work on a farm   the love

for farm work is in my blood  i believe   i want the smell of the

fresh turned earth  i want my arms to be tired heaving the sheaves into

the waggons  i want to lead out the horses early in the morning into the

dewy fields—i want  oh  many things ’



rosalie considered him wonderingly  these things were done around her

every day as a matter of course  but how curiously the man spoke of them 

how unaccountable was that longing of which he spoke   she had never seen

anyone the least like him  and  now that the conversation had drifted

away from herself  she felt a real pleasure and interest in listening to

his talk   as they drove onward through the gathering twilight she  too 

was moved to talk  and was charmed by his quick understanding and ready

response   her own wits were quick enough  but she had fallen into the

habit of keeping her opinions on abstract subjects to herself  the

concrete was all that the people with whom she associated were capable of

discussing  and  indeed  they had not much to say on any matter at any

time   this young bright personality was something so absolutely new to

her  his point of view so original and vigorous  and his sympathy so

magnetic  that rosalie enjoyed her adventure as she had never enjoyed

anything in her life before   her eyes shone  her cheeks flushed  her

merry laugh rang out  she felt that she  too  was young and

light hearted  and that life and youth and gay companionship made a very

delightful combination 



as they drew near their destination a sudden silence fell between them 

and presently richard broke it  speaking in a soft and altered tone 



‘how familiar the country grows   even in the dark i recognise a friend

at every turn   is not that your house yonder where the lights are

glimmering ’



‘yes ’ said rosalie  with a little unconscious sigh 



‘the cornfield where i saw you lies just to the right of it ’



‘i wish you would not talk in riddles ’ said rosalie  breathing rather

quickly   through the dusk he could see the wrathful fire in her eyes 



‘do not be angry ’ he said quickly  ‘i meant to tell you another time

when i had come to know you better  but after all why should i not tell

you now   i saw a picture of you in london   i stayed a day or two there

on my way through from liverpool—i had some business to do for a friend

in new york—and i went to the academy  and there  in the very first room 

i saw your picture ’



‘my picture ’ ejaculated she   ‘it must have been the one that london

gentleman said he would paint ’



‘yes  it was you—you yourself  and you were lying in a cornfield under a

shock of wheat  and the corner of your house could just be seen in the

distance  and some of the men were reaping a little way off—but you were

fast asleep ’



rosalie’s heart was thumping in a most unusual way  and her breath came

so pantingly that she did not trust herself to speak 



‘’t was a big picture ’ he said  ‘full of sunshine  and when i saw it—the

whole thing—the great field stretching away  and the men working  and the

quiet old house in the distance  and the girl sleeping so placidly—it was

all so glowing  and yet so peaceful and homelike that my heart went out

to it   “that’s dorset ” i said  and i believe i cried—i know i felt as

if i could cry   after all those years of wandering to find  when i

thought myself all alone in a great strange city  that piece of home

smiling at one—i tell you it made one feel queer ’



rosalie remained silent  angry with herself for the agitation which had

taken possession of her 



‘so you see i was not quite so far wrong in saying that to day’s meeting

was a very strange one   the first instant my eyes fell upon you i

recognised you ’



she felt she must say something  but her voice sounded husky and quite

unlike itself when she spoke 



‘it certainly was odd that we should come across each other near

dorchester   it would of course have been quite natural if you had

recognised me when you came to your uncle’s ’



‘i thought you would have been more interested in my story ’ he said

reproachfully  after a pause 



‘i am—i am very much interested  i think it a very funny story ’



‘funny ’ he repeated  and then relapsed into silence  which remained

unbroken until they turned in at rosalie’s gate 







chapter ii





    a thousand thorns  and briers  and stings

       i have in my poor breast 

    yet ne’er can see that salve which brings

       my passion any rest 



                                                                  herrick 



‘well  my boy  i be main glad you be come back   there bain’t no place

like home  be there ’



as isaac sharpe repeated these words for the twentieth time since his

nephew’s arrival  he beamed affectionately upon him through the fragrant

steam of the bowl of punch specially brewed in his honour  and then 

leaning back in his chair  sighed and shook his head 



‘ye be wonderful like your mother  richard ’ he said  and sighed again 

and groaned  and took another sip of punch  blinking the while  partly

from the strength of the decoction and partly because he was overcome by

emotion 



richard  sitting opposite to him  stretched out his legs luxuriously to

the warmth of the crackling wood fire  and  removing his pipe from his

lips  gazed contentedly round the familiar kitchen  which was now looking

its best in the homely radiance 



‘it is good to come back to the dear old place and to find everything

exactly the same as ever   you don’t seem to have grown a day older 

uncle isaac—nothing is changed   i can’t tell you how delightful that is 

i had been tormenting myself during the journey with fancying i should

find things altered—but  thank heaven  they are not ’



he glanced brightly at the broad  rubicund face opposite to him  and took

his glass from the table 



‘your health  uncle   may you live a thousand years  and may you be the

same at the end of them ’



he half emptied his glass  and set it down with a cheery laugh 



isaac drank slowly from his  peering meanwhile at his nephew over the

rim 



‘thank you  my lad ’ he said  replacing it on the table at last   ‘i’m

obliged to you  richard   ’t is kindly meant  but changes  d’ ye

see’—here he paused and coughed—‘changes  richard  is what must be looked

for in this here world ’



his colour  always sufficiently ruddy  was now so much heightened  and

his face assumed so curiously solemn an expression  that richard paused

with his pipe half way to his lips and stared at him with amazement and

gathering alarm 



‘what’s the matter ’ he said  anxiously   ‘are n’t you feeling well 

you’re looking first rate ’



‘never felt better in my life ’ rejoined his uncle in sepulchral tones 



‘come  that’s all right   you quite frightened me   what do you mean by

talking about changes ’



isaac took a gulp from his tumbler and fixed his round eyes dismally on

the young man 



‘there may be sich things as changes for the better ’ he remarked  still

in his deepest bass 



‘don’t believe in ’em ’ cried richard gaily   ‘don’t tell me you’re going

to turn methody  or salvationist  or anything of that kind   i like you

as you are—and i don’t want you to be any better ’



‘dear heart alive  what notions the chap d’ take in his head ’ ejaculated

the farmer  relaxing into a smile   ‘nay now  i never thought on sich

things  but there’ll be a change in this here house for all that 

richard   i be a goin’’—here isaac leaned forward  with a hand on either

knee  and fixed his eyes earnestly  almost tragically  on his nephew—‘i

be a goin’  richard  for to change my state ’



he slowly resumed an upright position  drawing in his breath through

dilated nostrils 



‘i be a goin’  richard ’ he continued  observing the other’s blank and

uncomprehending stare—‘i be a goin’ to get married ’



‘bless me ’ exclaimed richard  taken aback for a moment  then rising from

his chair he stepped up to his uncle  and slapped him heartily on the

back   ‘well done ’ he cried   ‘well done   i give you joy   upon my life

i did n’t think you had so much go in you—you’re a splendid old chap ’



‘thank ’ee ’ said isaac  without much enthusiasm   ‘i’m glad you’re not

agen it ’



‘why should i be against it ’ returned richard hilariously   ‘i’m a

little surprised  because i did n’t think that was in your line  but 

after all  “marry in haste and repent at leisure ” the saying goes—your

case is the reverse  you have taken your time about marrying  so perhaps

it will be all the better for you ’



‘i hope so  i’m sure ’ said the bridegroom elect  dolefully  adding  as

richard  still laughing  resumed his seat  ‘i thought i’d best tell ’ee

at once as there was goin’ to be a change ’



‘well  well  a change for the better  as you say ’ cried the other 

‘there’ll be two to welcome me when i pay the down farm a visit instead

of one   i shall find a jolly old aunt as well as a jolly old uncle ’



isaac took his pipe out of his mouth with a perturbed expression 



‘she bain’t so very old ’ he remarked 



‘no  no—of course not   neither are you for that matter   may she be an

evergreen like yourself ’



‘thank ’ee  richard  thank ’ee   i’m glad as you approve o’ my thinking

on matrimony ’



‘why  matrimony’s the best thing going ’ said richard  still gaily  yet

with an undercurrent of something curiously like tenderness   ‘every

grief is lessened by half  and every joy is doubled   always a bright

cheery face at the fireside  always a kind true hand in yours—a woman’s

wit to point out where the man has been at fault ’



‘ah ’ interrupted his uncle  with a groan  ‘they be willin’ enough to do

that ’



‘always ready to comfort you when you are in trouble ’ went on the young

man without heeding him  ‘ready to advise you when you are in a

difficulty—the best of companions  the most faithful of friends  the

kindest of helpmates—that’s a wife ’



the farmer was gazing across at him with bewilderment mixed with delight 



‘well said  richard —very well said   ye be wonderful quick wi’ your

tongue   if that’s the way ye feel about wedlock you ought to be lookin’

out for a wife o’ your own ’



‘nonsense  uncle isaac   why  i have n’t a penny   i shall have hard work

to keep myself to begin with ’



‘come  come  we mid be able to manage summat   i’ve a notion in my head 

ye be a goin’ to take up farm work agen  ye tell me  well  an’ as i says

to you  why not work on the farm where ye was brought up  and why not

take wage from your own flesh and blood instead of lookin’ to strangers

for ’t ’



‘there’s no one i should like to work for better than you  uncle

isaac—you know that ’



‘i do know it  richard   i d’ know it very well   “but ” says you to me 

“i must have somewheres to live ” says you ’



‘no  i don’t  uncle isaac   i say nothing of the kind ’ put in the young

man hastily   ‘if you intended to remain a bachelor it would be a

different matter  but—’



‘i’m not axing you to live wi’ me ’ returned isaac  throwing out his hand

in a lordly manner   ‘if i was a goin’ to keep single it ’ud come nat’ral

enough  but my new missus—well  ’t is this way   she have got a house of

her own  and she’s anxious for me to live over there along o’ her ’



‘i see ’ said richard  looking rather astonished  however 



‘’ees  i were agen it at first  but i come round to it arter   so i

reckoned to let this here house to somebody—one of the men  p’r’aps  but

now has you’ve a comed back  richard  my boy  there bain’t nobody i’d

like to see livin’ here so much as yourself   my notion ’ud be for you to

settle down wi’ a wife to do for you and keep the place tidy  and work

this here farm under me   my hands ’ull be pretty full  and i’ll be glad

o’ your help    she’s  got a biggish place to manage  and i’ll be glad to

think as there’s somebody here as i can rely on   well  what do you say ’



‘what do i say ’ cried richard  stammering with joy   ‘what can i say   i

don’t know how to thank you ’



‘well ’ said the farmer jovially  ‘and now  what about the missus   ’ave

’ee got your eye on anyone as ’ud suit ’



‘why ’ began richard eagerly  he paused  and then continued laughingly 

‘you must give me a little time  you know   i’ve only been a few days in

england ’



‘that’s true   i’m glad to think  my lad  as you don’t want to take a

wife from abroad   nay  don’t ye go travellin’ for a wife   take my word

for ’t  the best is often to be picked up close at hand   not always 

though ’ he continued  reflectively   ‘poor elias fiander—ye mind ’lias

fiander   he went travellin’ all the way to dorchester to buy a

turmit hoin’ machine  and it was there  nigh upon eighteen miles off  as

he come across his last missus   but you know her ’ he went on with

animation—‘aye  now as i call it to mind  you were a tellin’ me how you

drove her back to day   ah  sure  so ye did ’



‘yes ’ said richard quickly  ‘yes  i told you all about that ’



‘ah  so ye did   ’twere funny how you come across her   i be pleased to

think as ye’ve met   she were a good missus to elias—she were  indeed—and

a good missus to one man is like to be a good one to another ’



richard caught his breath and leaned forward  his face was flushed  his

eyes shining 



‘why do you say this to me now ’ he said eagerly 



his uncle removed his pipe from his mouth  took a sip of punch  and then

looked at him solemnly 



‘because  richard  my boy  ’t is but nat’ral i should talk of her  seein’

as we be goin’ to be man an’ wife so soon ’



‘what do you mean ’ cried richard  almost violently   ‘what are you

talking about ’



‘why ’ returned isaac  raising his voice to a kind of mild roar  ‘you

have n’t been listenin’ to me   i’ve been a talkin’ about mrs 

fiander—’lias’s widow   i be a goin’ to get married to she ’



‘you ’ exclaimed his nephew in the same loud fierce tone 



‘’ees ’ bellowed farmer sharpe   ‘have n’t i been a tellin’ ye this hour

and more   did n’t i say i were a goin’ to change my state  and did n’t i

tell ’ee she’d a house of her own and wanted me to live over there along

of her   but your brains was wool gatherin’—i’ll lay a shillin’ you was

a thinkin’ o’ your own young woman ’ cried isaac  with a roar of

laughter  stretching forward a long arm that he might give his nephew a

facetious dig on the nearest available portion of his person 



richard laughed too  spasmodically  and with a wry face 



‘you’re a sly dog  uncle isaac ’ he said   ‘ah  you’re a cunning old

chap—you’ve got your wits about you if mine have gone astray   yes  and

you’ve very good taste too—you’ve picked out the greatest beauty in

dorset ’



‘except your young woman  eh ’ put in isaac  with a chuckle and another

dig 



‘except my young woman  of course ’ agreed richard  laughing again with

that odd contortion of the face   ‘but i have n’t found her yet  you

know ’



‘my weddin’ day is fixed for the end o’ ju—ly ’ said his uncle

ruminatively   you’ll have to look out for your missus afore that time 

i doubt as you and bithey ’ud scarce get on so very well—i’m used to her 

you see  but she’s a cranky old body  and it ’ud never do for ye to

settle down wi’out a woman o’ some kind to do for ’ee   we might ha’ the

two weddin’s same day  i’d like to know as you was settled when i have to

shift ’



‘thank you kindly  uncle  you’ve always been like a father to me  and i

can’t tell you how grateful i am to you for the welcome you’ve given me 

and for wanting to do so much for me   but i don’t know about settling

down after all—i’ve been a rover so long  you see  i—i might n’t be able

to stick to it and then you might be disappointed ’



‘stuff an’ nonsense   i’ll not hear o’ no objections   why  richard  you

never were one to blow hot one minute and cold the next   it bain’t half

an hour since you said there was naught you wished for so much as to take

up farm work again and live on the old place—did n’t ’ee ’



‘yes  but—’



‘but nothin’   you’re a wool gatherin’—that’s it   your thoughts is

a wanderin’ off to the new missus ’



‘is not that to be expected ’ returned his nephew idly 



resting his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands he leaned

forward  gazing thoughtfully into the fire 



‘i have n’t got over my surprise at your piece of news yet ’ he said 

after a pause   ‘i thought you so determined a bachelor ’



‘so i thought myself ’ put in isaac with a nod 



‘and then—from what i’ve seen of mrs  fiander i should never have

imagined that she would be the wife you would choose when you did make up

your mind to take one ’



‘why so ’ inquired isaac  somewhat roughly 



‘she’s so young—forty years younger than you  i should think ’



‘thirty nine ’ corrected his uncle succinctly 



‘then she is so beautiful—so full of life  and spirit  and dash   i can’t

imagine how you came to think of her ’



there was a pause  during which isaac meditatively smoked and rubbed his

knees 



‘well ’ he said at last  ‘i did n’t exactly think of it myself  ye

see—but i could n’t someways find it in my heart to say no ’



‘to say what ’ cried the young man  dropping his hands and whisking round

in his chair 



isaac gazed at him mildly  and continued to polish his corduroys 



‘to say no ’ he repeated  slightly uplifting his voice  and speaking very

slowly and distinctly   ‘i say i could n’t find it i’ my ’eart

to—say—no—when she axed me ’



‘she asked you   do you mean to say that the proposal came from her ’



his uncle nodded 



‘’t war n’t very likely it ’ud ha’ come fro’ me ’ he remarked

dispassionately   ‘as i told her at the time  i never was a marryin’

man ’



a silence ensued  during which richard vainly endeavoured to readjust his

ideas   at length he said faintly 



‘and what did she say to that ’



‘she said ’ returned farmer sharpe stolidly  ‘that it would n’t be a bad

thing for me—“’t is a fine farm ” says she  “and a good business   you

could easy work the two farms together ” says she ’



richard gazed at his uncle with starting eyes and a dropping jaw 



‘but why  in the name of fortune ’ he ejaculated   ‘i could understand

her marrying again—but why you ’



‘she knowed i’d work the farm right  d’ ye see   things was goin’ wrong

all round  and she knowed i understood the work   ah  i told her myself

at the time that she ought to look out for a younger man  but she says 

“i don’t want no counter jumpers ” says she—meanin’ the branston folks 

ah  there were a good few after her  but she did n’t fancy none o’ them 

she thought some was arter the money  and none o’ them knowed anythin’

about dairy farmin’ ’



‘in fact ’ struck in richard  rising from his chair and beginning to pace

hastily about the room  ‘she has proved herself to be a most practical

woman   you won’t make away with her money—you won’t allow mismanagement

of the business ’



‘jist so ’ agreed his uncle  sucking vigorously at his partially

extinguished pipe 



richard continued to walk about the room  and presently paused opposite

the hearth 



‘did she make an offer to elias fiander too ’ he inquired sharply 



isaac removed his pipe and stared up at him   the idea was evidently

presented to him for the first time 



‘he never telled me so ’ he said   ‘it were made up in a hurry  to be

sure   ’lias had n’t no notion o’ sich a thing when he started off from

here   he went arter a turnip hoer arter her granfer’s death   they sold

’en up  poor old chap  and rosalie—that’s mrs  fiander—had n’t nowhere to

go ’



‘ha ’ remarked richard sardonically 



‘but i think ’ pursued the farmer  averting his eyes from his nephew’s

face and gazing stolidly at the fire—‘i  think  ’twas ’lias as axed her 

’ees  now i can mind he told me so at the time   “me wantin’ a wife so

bad ” says he  “and her bein’ such a good hand at the dairy work  i

thought i’d make sure o’ her ” he says ’



‘she told him  i suppose  that she was a good hand at dairy work ’

commented marshall   ‘yes  i understand the matter now   she is  as i

say  a practical woman ’



‘she is—she is ’ agreed farmer sharpe warmly   ‘she be a wonderful good

manager   many’s the time i’ve said that   ah  i reckon i can say i’m in

luck ’



richard murmured something inarticulate and returned to his chair 

re lighting his pipe and beginning to smoke without further remark   on

the opposite side of the hearth isaac ruminated contentedly  without

appearing to notice his nephew’s preoccupation  and tumblers and pipes

were emptied in almost unbroken silence 



when richard sought his room that night—the familiar little attic room

which had been his in childhood—his first act after a cursory glance of

recognition and approval was to set down his candle on the little deal

table and to draw carefully from his pocket a large envelope   opening

this  he took out a print  evidently cut from some illustrated paper  or

collection of ‘pictures of the year ’  holding it close to the light  he

looked at it intently   underneath were the words  ‘a sleeping beauty ’

followed by the artist’s name   the picture represented a cornfield with

a large ‘shock’ of sheaves to the front  beneath which lay the

outstretched figure of a girl asleep   even in this rough reproduction a

certain likeness to rosalie was discernible  and richard’s fancy supplied

the rest   indeed  as he gazed  he contemplated not only the glowing and

highly finished work of art which had haunted him persistently since he

had first beheld it  but the vision of that afternoon—the exquisite face 

the lithe  graceful form which had suddenly appeared to him against its

background of bloom and sunlit green   he seemed to hear again the blithe

young voice which had thrilled him as it prattled at his side  he seemed

to see the large eyes lifted a little shyly to his  and then modestly

dropped because of his too evident admiration 



he had deemed these things the outward indication of absolute womanly

perfection   his young imagination  fired by the unexpected meeting with

rosalie  and further stimulated by his uncle’s chance remarks  had

created a marvellous romance before isaac had pronounced the name of his

own future bride   now the golden glow had vanished  all was flat  and

dull  and grey  and  what was worse  he knew his ideal to have been

delusive   young bloom and beauty and fascination meant nothing—rosalie

fiander was a calculating  mercenary woman  devoid even of feminine

reticence   not content with ‘setting her cap’—odious phrase —at the man

whom she considered best likely to protect her interests  she had

actually offered herself to him  haggled over the prospective bargain 

weighed with him the gains which must accrue to both   when she was

little more than a child she had angled for old elias fiander   well  she

was homeless and penniless then  and might from her extreme youth be

supposed to know no better  but now in the ripeness of her womanhood 

with wealth  liberty  all that she could desire  at her command  she must

needs sell herself again   pah  such a nature must positively be

depraved 



with an impetuous movement he held the paper over the candle  but as

suddenly snatched it away again  extinguishing the flame with his finger

and thumb  and rubbing the burnt edge ruefully 



‘this at least is a thing of beauty ’ he said  ‘why destroy it ’



then  hastily restoring the print to its wrapper and thrusting it into

his pocket again  he muttered  ‘i wish i had never seen her ’

isaac was somewhat disappointed at his nephew’s lack of enthusiasm over a

project which had at first seemed to take his fancy so much   talk as he

might about richard’s future  and his own desire that he should pass the

remainder of his days on the down farm  he could extract nothing from the

young man but vague expressions of gratitude  and a doubtful promise to

think the matter over 



‘i’m goin’ up yonder to fiander’s ’ remarked isaac  after breakfast 

‘there’s a little matter there as i must see to   ye mid as well step up

along wi’ me  richard ’



‘i was thinking of taking a stroll round this place ’ rejoined richard 



‘why  what’s all your hurry   ye may as well wait till i am ready to go

wi’ ye   i’ll not be above two or three minutes at littlecomb  and then

we mid walk round together   besides  ye’ll be wantin’ to pay your

respects to mrs  fiander  won’t ye  arter drivin’ her from dorchester

yesterday—and her that’s goin’ to be your aunt ’



‘to be sure  i must keep on good terms with my aunt  must n’t i   else

perhaps she won’t make me welcome when i come to see you ’



‘no fear o’ that—she’ll make ’ee welcome enough   she al’ays behaved

uncommon civil and respectful to i in ’lias’s time   ah  sure  that she

did ’



‘perhaps she won’t be pleased at my calling so early ’



‘early   dear heart alive   you don’t know that woman  richard   she’s

astir soon arter four in the morning  and she has her maids afoot afore

that   aye  and the men knows if they comes late they’ll get fined   ah 

she be a wonderful manager ’



‘then  what in the name of wonder ’ said richard to himself  as he

followed the portly white figure across the yard and over the downs—‘what

in the name of wonder can she want with you ’



despite farmer sharpe’s protest most people would have considered the

hour at which they betook themselves to call at littlecomb farm a

sufficiently early one   the dew lay thick and sparkling upon the short

herbage of the downs  and the air was still sharp and keen   a lark was

circling over their heads  its jubilant notes piercing richard’s heart

with an odd sense of pain   what was this heaviness which had come upon

him  and which even the brisk walk through the exhilarating air  and the

delightfully familiar scents  and sounds  and sights could not drive

away 



now they had entered rosalie’s demesne   these wide fields were hers 

yonder were her cattle grazing by the river  and here  peeping through

the trees and compassed about by a goodly array of stacks  was her house

with its bodyguard of farm buildings 



richard  who had not spoken much throughout the walk  became altogether

silent as he crossed the well kept yard  and even lagged behind when his

uncle approached the open milkhouse door   through this open door the

sound of female voices could be heard  raised  one in voluble excuse 

another  whose tone richard recognised with a little shiver of

inexplicable anguish  in vituperation   but isaac sharpe boldly advanced

into the building  and beckoned to him to follow 



‘why  what’s the matter here ’ he inquired good humouredly   ‘fine

mornin’  mrs  f   i’ve brought my nevvy to see ye ’



‘he’ll find us rather in a mess  i’m afraid ’ returned rosalie’s clear

voice  still with a distinct note of sharpness in it  ‘but i am very glad

he has come  i want to thank him for his kindness to me yesterday ’



peering over his uncle richard descried the mistress of the establishment

stooping over the large cheese vat already alluded to  one white arm 

bare almost to the shoulder  vigorously kneading and stirring a huge mass

of curds   her buff print dress appeared to imprison the sunshine  and

attitude and movement alike showed off her supple figure to the very best

advantage 



most lovers  thought the young man  would have been unable to resist the

temptation of putting an arm about that inviting waist for the morning

greeting—the arm of the future husband had surely a right to be there 

but isaac sharpe stood bluff and square in the doorway  his hands in his

pockets  his hat on his head 



‘you’ll excuse my shaking hands ’ said rosalie  looking up with eyes in

which the angry light still lingered  and a puckered brow   ‘everything

is upset  and i can’t leave the curds for a minute   indeed  as it is i

fancy the whole of this batch will be good for nothing ’



a hitherto imperceptible dimple peeped out near her lips when she

spoke—such red ripe lips   such a bewitching dimple   isaac  however 

merely thrust his hands a little deeper into his pockets  and again

inquired with increased concern 



‘why  what’s wrong ’



‘this morning i happened to be late ’ said rosalie  uplifting her voice 

evidently for the benefit of the culprit  jane  who had suddenly melted

into tears  a fact which was betrayed by her heaving shoulders as she

stood with her back to the visitors 



‘i happened to be a little late ’ repeated rosalie severely  ‘so i

desired one of the maids’—here jane sniffed deprecatingly—‘to start work

without me   and when i came down  what do you think   i actually found

the careless girl pouring the rennet in out of the bottle ’



‘tch  tch  tch ’ commented the farmer  clicking his tongue

commiseratingly 



‘there were n’t but a few spoonfuls left ’ explained jane  almost

inarticulately 



‘how could you possibly tell how many were left ’ retorted her mistress 

with increased acerbity   ‘you know how particular i always am to measure

it out drop for drop almost—a spoonful too much may make all the

difference—particularly at this time of year   i call it downright wicked

of you to run the risk of spoiling the whole vat ful   there are a

hundred and fifty gallons of milk in this vat—it should make nearly a

hundredweight of cheese   and just because you are so idle and careless

it may all go to waste ’



jane turned her pretty tear bedabbled face over her shoulder  and

inconsequently and incoherently protested that she always did her best 

then  with a gasp and a moan  she darted past the group in the doorway

and ran round the house 



richard looked after her with a disgusted air  and then his glance

reverted to mrs  fiander  whose beautiful round arm was still embedded in

curds  and whose face  a little paler than its wont  continued to be full

of ire   what could this trifling mistake matter after all to such a rich

woman  a woman who would soon be richer still   besides being

cold blooded and self interested  she was evidently miserly  she was 

moreover  distinctly bad tempered   his imagination  already warped by

the revulsion of feeling consequent on his uncle’s disclosures  was ready

to take alarm at every trivial detail   rosalie’s pallor  and the

slightly drawn look on her face—both due in reality to a sleepless night 

resulting from an unaccountable perturbation of mind—were immediately

attributed to an acute and unreasonable disappointment over an

insignificant money loss   the eyes which had gazed on rosalie so

ardently yesterday were now busily tracing lines of fancied meanness in

her face  those frowning brows surely revealed the shrew  the compressed

lips spoke of parsimony   when that lovely colour faded  and those

clear cut features had become coarsened by age and self imposed toil 

what would remain   none of that beauty of soul which he had thought to

find there 



‘well  well ’ remarked isaac placidly  ‘these accidents will happen  but

i would n’t advise ’ee to be cast down by ’em   these here curds d’ seem

to be a settin’ all right   i know how ’t is wi’ young folks   a body has

to stand over them all the time   why  when we be a shearin’ i d’ scarce

dare go in for a bit o dinner for fear o’ findin’ them poor ewes snipped

to pieces when i come back ’



rosalie jerked the mass of curds up with additional impetuosity  but made

no reply 



‘my nevvy ’ pursued isaac  ‘thought he’d like to drop in an’ pay his

respects to ’ee  my dear  an’ inquire how you was a feelin’ arter the

accident yesterday ’



here he nudged richard as a tacit reproach for his muteness 



‘i hope ’ said the young man formally  ‘that you are none the worse for

the shock  mrs  fiander ’



the blue eyes shot up an inquiring glance  and the industrious arm paused

for a moment   what was the meaning of this altered tone  and why was the

gaze now bent on her fraught with such cold disapproval   they had parted

like old friends  and she had looked forward more than she knew to their

next meeting 



‘thank you ’ she returned  in a tone almost as frigid as richard’s own 

‘my nerves are not easily upset ’



she believed the statement to be true  yet the equilibrium of her system

was at that moment  if she had but realised it  very seriously disturbed 



‘have ’ee sent for nigger  mrs  f  ’ inquired isaac 



‘i sent james bundy to look after him   he may not be fit to move for a

day or two ’



‘ah  he were a good beast ’ remarked the farmer  ‘’t is a pity ye did let

’en slip   ’t was wi’ drivin’ fast down hill  my nevvy here d’ tell me 

an’ that’s what he’ve never been used to   ye should have druv ’en more

carefully  my dear ’



rosalie thought of the cause of her unusual haste on the previous day  it

was her anxiety to escape from the too evident admiration of the grey

eyes which were now bent on her with so different an expression   the

memory confused her  the contrast stung her  she answered sharply  and

with assumed indifference 



‘one cannot crawl down every slope to suit the convenience of a worn out

animal ’



‘he bain’t worn out  though ’ returned her future husband  who invariably

took things literally   ‘nay  i should say he’d last a good few years

yet  though he be past ’ard work   ’lias al’ays used ’en gentle  ’t is

wonderful how far that’ll go both with man an’ beast   “fair an’ soft do

go far in a day ” the sayin’ goes   fair an’ soft—ah  ’t is trew  ’t is

trew ’



rosalie bent her head over the vat in silence  her face averted  so that

her visitors could see only the outline of her cheek  the exquisite

curves of ear and neck 



‘fair and soft ’ muttered richard to himself   ‘fair and soft enough to

look at  but her heart is as the nether millstone ’



his uncle gazed reproachfully at him  he was proud of his travelled and

book learned nephew  and had eagerly looked forward to the impression he

was sure to produce on ‘mrs  f  ’ who had also been highly educated  and

was considered an authority on matters appertaining to culture—and he was

not showing off at all   he was standing there  mum chance  as stupid as

any other body might be   he gave him another admonitory nudge and

remarked 



‘richard  that’s my nevvy  did quite take me by surprise last night   i

was n’t expectin’ to see ’en at all   to tell the trewth i had no kind o’

notion o’ where he mid be   he had n’t wrote—how long were it since

you’ve a wrote me last  richard ’ inquired isaac  driving home the query

with his elbow  and again frowning and winking 



‘i don’t know ’ answered his nephew  in muffled tones   ‘a long time  i’m

afraid  but  you see  you never wrote to me ’ he added with a laugh 



‘that be different  my boy ’ returned the farmer seriously   ‘there was

reasons why i did n’t write  richard   i never was a writin’ man   lard 

no ’—and here he relaxed  and uttered a jolly laugh —‘’t is as much as i

can do to put my name to a receipt  an’ then bithey d’ do it for i  and i

do jist stick my mark under it   nay  richard  i never was one for

writing much—nay  i was n’t ’



he continued to roll his shoulders and to chuckle ‘nay’ meditatively at

intervals  but his eyes were meanwhile fixed appealingly upon the face of

richard  who remained obstinately dumb 



presently their hostess came to his assistance 



‘i suppose  now that you are here  you’ll remain some time  mr 

marshall ’ she asked  without looking round  her voice in consequence

sounding nearly as muffled as the young man’s own as she bent over her

cauldron 



‘that depends  mrs  fiander   of course i want to see as much as i can of

my uncle  but i’m restless by nature  and—and i never stay very long in

one place ’



‘there now ’ cried isaac  in loud remonstrance   ‘what  ye be at it

again  be ye   did n’t we arguefy enough about it last night   i’ll not

take no  an’ so i tell ’ee   ye’ve a comed home  and now ye may bide at

home   lard  i did n’t think ye could be sich a voolish chap   what need

have ye to go travellin’ the world when ye have a good berth offered ye 

an’ them that’s al’ays been your friends ready an’ anxious to keep ye 

here’s mrs  f  will tell ’ee the same as i do  won’t ’ee  my dear ’



‘i don’t quite understand what it is all about ’ said rosalie  pausing in

her labours  however  and straightening herself 



why  ’t is this way ’ explained the farmer   ‘when richard come last

night he says to me  says he  “i’ve been a longing for years an’ years to

get back to the wold place   an’ now ” says he  “i d’ feel as if i could

n’t settle to naught but the old work   farm work ” he says   “well then 

this here house ’ull be empty afore very long  an’  moreover ” says i  “i

shall need to have somebody responsible to look after this place ” for it

stands to reason  mrs  f   as i can’t be in two places at one time ’



rosalie endorsed this statement with an inarticulate murmur  and he

continued 



‘“well  then ” says i  “since you want to come back to the wold place an’

take up the farm work  why not live here and work for i ”’



‘why not  indeed ’ said rosalie 



‘jist what i d’ say ’ said the farmer indignantly  ‘why not   first he

were quite took wi’ the notion  but arter a bit he did n’t seem to relish

it   now i want to know ’ pursued isaac  extending an aggrieved

forefinger  ‘why don’t ’ee relish it  richard ’



‘suppose you should be disappointed in me—suppose i should n’t give you

satisfaction ’ said richard hesitatingly 



‘pooh  nonsense   i’ll let ’ee know fast enough if ye don’t give

satisfaction   have n’t i brought ’ee up   bain’t he much same as a son

to i ’



‘but if—if i should find i could n’t settle  then you’d be more vexed

than if i had n’t given in to the plan ’



‘but why should n’t ’ee settle  that’s what i want to know   ax ’en that 

mrs  f   ax ’en why he should n’t settle   ha’n’t ’ee travelled enough ’



‘yes  indeed ’ said rosalie  ‘i should think you ought to be glad of a

little quiet  mr  marshall ’



‘well said ’ cried isaac   ‘tell ’en he’ll be a fool if he lets my offer

slip ’



‘indeed ’ repeated rosalie  gazing in surprise from the heated and

excited countenance of the elder man to the inscrutable one of his

nephew—‘indeed i think mr  marshall would be very unwise if he did not

accept it   it seems to me entirely to his advantage ’



‘and of course ’ said richard  with a momentary gleam in his steel grey

eyes  ‘of course my personal advantage should outweigh every other

consideration   it is obvious   nothing like a woman’s clear head for

solving a difficulty   i will take your advice ’



rosalie’s pretty face wore a look of such absolute bewilderment  and she

was evidently so much at a loss to account for his sarcastic tone  that

richard suddenly burst out laughing  the cloud lifted from his brow 

giving place to an expression of frank good humour   ‘uncle isaac ’ he

cried  clapping him heartily on the shoulder  ‘forgive my chopping and

changing so often  this time my mind is made up   i accept your offer 

shake hands on it ’







chapter iv





    the blackthorn flower hath fallen away—

    the blackthorn flower that wise men say

    keeps wild and variable skies

       as long as it may stay 

    but here’s the gorse  and here’s the whin 

    and here the pearlèd may appears 

    and poison weeds of satin skin

    through every bank prick long green ears

       to hear the cuckoo cries 



                                                          elinor sweetman 



    to gather flowers sappho went 

       and homeward she did bring 

    within her lawny continent 

       the treasure of the spring 



                                                                  herrick 



richard marshall drove the plough slowly up the brown slope  half turned

at the summit  halted  and  having established his horses at a

comfortable angle  sat down  with his back against a tall mossy bank

sheltered by a little copse  to eat his breakfast 



he had already partaken of a ‘dew bit’ shortly after dawn  but two or

three hours’ exercise in the brisk morning air had whetted his appetite

afresh  and he now fell to work on his bread and bacon with the utmost

zest and relish 



the great field  all glittering green save for the brown strip which

testified to recent labours  stretched away for many goodly acres   on a

lesser slope beneath he could see the roofs of littlecomb farm and its

appurtenances  but the sight of the amber and ruddy outlines awakened in

him now no feeling of repulsion   during the past weeks he had laughed

himself out of his whilom fancy for the fascinating and disappointing

widow  he had even taken himself to task somewhat severely for his

strictures on that unconscious young woman   was it her fault  after all 

that her outer parts belied her real self   why had he been so

unreasonably angry because she had failed to correspond to the high

estimate which he had formed on slight and inadequate premises   she was

a very beautiful creature  and  no doubt  good enough in her way  if she

was common place  and had a sharp eye for the main chance  she would make

the better wife to a practical farmer   he would in all probability get

on well enough with her when she became his aunt  but meanwhile life was

too full of congenial work and ever growing interest to admit of his

wasting time in improving his acquaintance with the future mrs  sharpe 



he had thrown himself into his new pursuits with characteristic energy 

and found them daily more and more engrossing   he possessed a gift not

often to be met with in the cultivator of the soil—a love of nature for

her own sake—a sympathy with her moods  not from the practical  but from

the poetical standpoint   clouds and sunlight  frosts and dew  meant more

to him than to his brother toiler  the very odour of the damp earth  the

fragrance of the bursting buds in copse and hedgerow  of the crushed

herbage beneath his feet  intoxicated him   the homely thud of the

horses’ hoofs as they trod the furrow  the ripping up of the green sod as

he drove the plough through it  the mere consciousness of his own vigour

and life and manhood dominating this solitude  filled him with a kind of

ecstasy   ‘this is what i want ’ he had said to himself over and over

again that morning  ‘this is what i have always wanted ’



he had finished his breakfast now  but he permitted himself the luxury of

repose for a few moments longer   he threw himself back on the bank  his

head resting on his clasped hands  and his eyes gazing up  up  through

the interlacing boughs of the trees  outlined now with shifting silver in

the morning light  through the ethereal leafage  still half unfolded  up

to the heights of delicate blue beyond   he had fancied that there was

not much breeze this morning  yet  as he lay thus quiet he could hear a

faint rustling in the undergrowth  and the occasional crackling of

twigs—a squirrel perhaps  but when was a wood known to be absolutely

still   besides the incidental noises attending the passage of living

things—flying  running  creeping—the creaking and swaying of boughs  the

fluttering of leaves  had not such places a mysterious movement and

vitality of their own   was there not always a stir  a whisper  in their

midst produced by no ostensible cause 



smiling upwards  his head still pillowed on his hands  richard was

meditating on some half forgotten page of thoreau which seemed to bear

upon this fancy of his  when suddenly a woman’s figure appeared on the

crest of the bank close to him  and without warning sprang down beside

him   rosalie fiander  with the skirt of her print gown gathered up so as

to form a receptacle for the mass of primroses which she had been

gathering  and the fragrance of which was now wafted to richard’s

nostrils—rosalie fiander  with minute dewdrops clinging to her dark hair 

with morning roses on her cheeks  and the morning light shining in her

eyes—a vision of grace and beauty  more captivating even than the glowing

pictured rosalie of the cornfield or the stately heroine of yellowham

woods 



richard sat up  the colour rushing over his sunburnt face  he had

divested himself of hat and coat  his waistcoat hung loosely open  and

his shirt was unfastened at the throat   for a moment rosalie did not

identify him  then  as he slowly rose to his feet  she too blushed 



‘i beg your pardon  i did not know anyone was here   i had a half hour to

spare before breakfast and ran out to pick some primroses   this is my

wood  you know ’ she added hastily  ‘i am not trespassing unless when i

take a short cut home across your uncle’s field ’



ploughman richard  with his bare brown arms and ruffled head  was not at

all alarming   she scarcely recognised in him the trim  severe young man

who had called on her ceremoniously a few weeks before  still less the

mysterious personage who had driven her home from dorchester  who had

said such strange things  and looked at her so oddly—isaac sharpe’s

nephew was just like anybody else after all   being blithe of heart this

bright spring morning  she smiled on him pleasantly  and  lowering the

folds of her gown  displayed the primroses 



‘are they not lovely   i like them better than any other flower—in fact 

i love them   almost the first thing that i can remember is holding on to

my mother’s finger while she took me up to a bank of primroses 

afterwards  when i grew old enough to pick them for myself  oh  the

delight  each spring  of finding the first primrose ’



now  curiously enough  the gay tone and easy manner had the effect of

filling richard with wrath  the very grace of her attitude  the

child like candour of her eyes were to him obnoxious  the more so because

he could not repress a momentary thrill of admiration   he knew how much

they were worth  he knew the sordid nature beneath this attractive

disguise 



‘primroses are fine things ’ he said  with assumed carelessness   ‘you

should have picked some before the nineteenth  then you would have had a

good sale for them ’



‘but i don’t want to sell them ’ cried she  her white teeth flashing out

as she laughed  and the dimples coming and going   ‘i picked them for

myself—i shall fill every vase in the house   primroses should never be

sold  those you see in the streets look so miserable  all huddled

together with their dear little faces crushed and faded  and even their

scent gone   it seems a sin to sell primroses ’



‘yes  particularly as i don’t suppose they fetch a big price in the

market ’



she had gathered up a bunch in one hand  and now raised it to her soft

cheek 



‘they are like satin ’ she said 



somehow the gesture and the smile which accompanied it provoked richard

beyond endurance 



‘they are pretty little yellow things ’ he said  ‘but not worth the

attention of practical people   there are other yellow things more

deserving of admiration—rolls of beautiful fresh butter  for instance 

fine round cheeses —the beauty of these is that they can be exchanged for

still finer yellow things—golden coin  mrs  fiander  that is the only

yellow thing really worth thinking about ’



‘are you so fond of money ’ she asked innocently  and once more she laid

the dew drenched flowers caressingly against her cheek   how could she

look so guileless  how had she the face to turn the tables on him thus 

above all  how dared she be so beautiful   he had almost succeeded in

forgetting his transitory hallucination  he wanted to ignore her

charm—and here she was tantalising him afresh 



‘are we not all fond of money ’ he said  with a forced laugh   ‘are not

you fond of money ’



‘am i ’ queried she  and the blue eyes glanced up with genuine

astonishment 



‘why  of course you are   we’re all fond of it  i say   we men toil for

it  we sell our brains for it—we sell our strength and power  and the

best years of our lives for it   and you women—’



he paused   rosalie  surprised at his vehemence  but still half amused 

inquired lightly 



‘well  what do we do   take care of it when we’ve got it  and do without

it when we have n’t ’



‘not always ’ he added  and this time there was no mistaking the

deliberate insolence of his tone   ‘sometimes a woman sells herself when

she has n’t got it  and sometimes  mistrusting her own powers of

management  she invites other people to take care of it for her ’



there was a dead silence for a moment   richard  fixing his merciless

gaze upon her face  saw the colour ebb from it  leaving the very lips

white   his shot had struck home—he was glad of it 



‘what do you mean ’ said rosalie at last  lifting her eyes  which she had

involuntarily lowered  and looking at him steadily 



‘i think you must know what i mean ’ he returned  with a smile almost

insulting in its contemptuousness 



‘why should you attack me ’ she inquired  without flinching  though her

large eyes looked pathetic in their surprise and pain 



‘am i attacking you   i am merely stating facts   when a penniless young

girl marries a prosperous old man one is bound to conclude that his money

is the chief attraction  and when that same girl  finding herself a few

years later rich and free  offers herself for the second time to a man

forty years older than herself—’



‘offers herself ’ cried rosalie  turning upon him fiercely while the

blood returned impetuously to her face  ‘how dare you say such an

insulting thing to me ’



‘is it not true ’ he inquired   ‘i have the statement on most excellent

authority ’



rosalie dropped her flower laden skirt  a yellow shower falling at her

feet  and buried her face in her hands 



‘oh ’ she groaned  ‘isaac told you that   he—he said—oh  how could he ’



the beautiful shoulders heaved  tears trickled through her fingers  but

richard steeled his heart against her   let her suffer—let her cry 

these selfish tears could not expiate the things that she had done 

tears and subterfuges were woman’s natural weapons  but they should not

avail her   she should be made to realise her own vileness 



‘do you deny it ’ he said sternly 



rosalie dropped her hands  and raised her head  her lip was still

quivering  but her eyes shone through the tears 



‘i deny nothing ’ she said  and without another word walked away from

him  down the slope  and across the field  passing through a gate at the

further end 



richard stood looking after her until she was out of sight  then his eyes

reverted to the heap of primroses lying at his feet—a tumbled heap 

sweet  and dewy  and fresh—just as they had fallen from her gown 



mechanically he stooped and began to gather them together  but presently

he threw back again the flowers he had picked up 



‘what should i do with them ’ he murmured  half aloud   straightening

himself he passed his hand across his brow  and looked round him with a

blank stare   ‘what have i done ’ he said 







chapter v





    colin  the grass was grey and wet the sod

    o’er which i heard her velvet footfall come 

    but heaven  where yet no pallid crescent rode 

    flowered in fire behind the bloomless plum 

    there stirred no wing nor wind  the wood was dumb 

    only blown roses shook their leaves abroad

    on stems more tender than an infant’s thumb—

    soft leaves  soft hued  and curled like cupid’s lip—

    and each dim tree shed sweetness over me 

    from honey dews that breathless boughs let slip

          in the orchard by the sea 



                                                          elinor sweetman 



‘ye bain’t sich very good company to night  richard ’ remarked mr 

sharpe  laying down his knife and fork  and gazing critically at his

nephew   ‘nay  i can’t say as ye be   you have n’t opened your mouth

since we sat down  except just to put a bit into it now and again  and

not too often neither   ye bain’t eatin’ nothing to speak on  an’ ye have

n’t a word to throw to a dog   what’s amiss ’



‘why—nothing ’ returned richard  rousing himself with a startled look

from the brown study into which he had fallen   ‘i suppose i am tired ’

he added  as an afterthought 



‘ah  very like ye be ’ agreed the farmer commiseratingly   ‘it just

depends on what a man’s used to how soon he gets knocked up   you be used

to town  an’ travellin’  and that  and when you come back to the

ploughin’ it tries you a bit to start wi’   ’t is just the other way wi’

i  i’m used to the country  d’ ye see  and when i do have to go to

town—to dorchester  or weymouth  or any big place like that—lard  i do

get mortal tired   walkin’ them streets  now  and lookin’ in at the

shop winders—dear heart alive  it makes me so weary as i could very nigh

drop down in the middle of ’em   as for travellin’—goin’ in trains an’

sich like—it do make me so stiff i can scarce lay legs to the ground when

i do ’light from ’em   but i dare say you found it a hardish bit o’ work

turnin’ up the big field yonder ’



his nephew made no response  and isaac bawled out the question afresh 



the young man  who had been absently balancing a fork on his fore finger 

started  and replied hastily that he had n’t found it at all hard—at

least—yes  perhaps rather hard  but very pleasant  and he liked the work 



isaac took a farewell pull at his pint mug  set it down  and pushed his

plate away 



‘draw up to the fire  lad ’ he said  ‘and smoke your pipe quick  and then

turn in—ye bain’t fit for nothin’ but bed ’



‘no  no ’ returned richard hastily  as he rose  ‘i could not go to bed

yet—it is not much past eight   i don’t think i’ll sit down by the

fire—i’ll go out for a stroll to stretch my legs ’



‘stretch your legs ’ commented his uncle indignantly   ‘ha’n’t ye

stretched them enough to day already   you’ve a worked hard enough for

two men ’



‘no remedy so good as a hair of the dog that bit you  you know ’ said

richard   ‘a brisk turn will take the stiffness off  and it is a lovely

evening ’



‘lard  how restless these young chaps do be ’ ejaculated isaac  as he

scraped his chair across the tiled floor to the hearth  ‘a body mid think

he’d be glad enough to set down for a bit   i’ll engage he’ll find it

hard enough to turn out to morrow morn ’



when richard had proceeded a little way he paused  and drew a long

breath  then  wheeling round swiftly  began to retrace his steps  brought

himself to a stand still for the second time  his hands clenched  his

eyes fixed  finally  crying aloud  ‘i will do it—i must do it ’  he

turned once more  and pursued his former course 



the sun had set some time before  but the heavens were still luminous 

the rosy glow which lingered at the horizon merging into soft primrose 

which in its turn melted into an exquisite ethereal green   against this

lambent background the hills and woods stood out darkly purple  while the

little copses scattered here and there upon the downs  and the hedge at

the further end  appeared to be almost black   little parties of his

uncle’s sheep scurried out of richard’s way  a bell tinkling here and

there among them  birds flew almost into his face as he passed the groups

of trees before alluded to  when he forced his way through the hedge a

trailing tendril of honeysuckle  wet with the heavy dew  flapped against

his face  every now and then a rabbit crossed his path  its passage

scarcely noticeable in the dusk save for the flash of its little white

tail   there must have been thyme growing on or about those downs  for

its fragrance was strong in the air   richard did not  however  pause to

inhale it—it is even doubtful if he noticed it  yet  when by and by

entering rosalie’s fields he skirted a bank overgrown with primroses 

their perfume for a moment turned him almost faint 



here was the house at last—how quiet at this hour   nothing seemed to be

stirring  no one was about 



susan appeared in answer to a somewhat tremulous knock  and informed him

that her mistress was in the garden 



‘i’ll soon call her ’ she added 



‘no  no ’ he returned quickly   ‘i will go to her—i only want to see her

for a moment ’



who knew   she might refuse to obey the summons  it was best to come upon

her without warning 



‘round to the left ’ explained susan  ‘the path leads you up to the

gate ’



following her directions  and passing through the little wicket  richard

presently found himself in the walled enclosure which had once been the

manor house garden  for littlecomb had been the dower house of a noble

family  along the straight prim paths stately ladies had loved to pace 

and the lavender hedge which was rosalie’s pride had been the pride of

many a titled dame before her   it was more of a pleasant wilderness than

a garden now  having been neglected by elias and his predecessors on the

farm  but rosalie was endeavouring to reclaim it  and already had made

progress with the work   richard  walking slowly onward  glanced

anxiously down the dim alleys  and peered into various overgrown bowers 

at length  amid a mass of distant greenery  he descried a moving figure 

and  quickening his pace  advanced towards it   the afterglow had now

almost faded  and the moon had not yet risen  here beneath these high

walls and amid this dense growth everything looked shadowy and unreal 



he would scarcely have distinguished which was path and which was

flower border had he not been guided towards the spot where she stood by

a double line of white pinks   now a blossom laden apple bough barred his

progress  now he passed beneath an arch of monthly roses  brushing off

the moisture from leaf and bloom as he went 



all at once rosalie’s voice called through the dusk 



‘is that you  susan   come here for a moment  i want you to hold this

branch ’



richard made no reply  but hastened on   the shadowy figure turned  and

he saw the pale silhouette of her face   she was standing beneath a great

bush laden with white blossoms  which from their size and perfume he

judged to be lilac  she had drawn down a branch and was endeavouring to

detach one of the clustering blooms 



‘who is it ’ she said quickly 



‘it is i ’ he returned 



she loosed the branch  which flew rustling up to join its fellows  and

made a step forward  he could see her face more clearly now  the gleam of

her white teeth between her parted lips  he even fancied that he could

detect an angry sparkle in her eyes 



‘why do you come here ’ she said   ‘here at least i supposed myself

safe ’



‘i came ’ replied richard  in an unsteady voice  ‘to beg your pardon most

humbly  most sincerely  for my conduct to you to day ’



‘it was inexcusable ’ she said  after a pause   it seemed to him that she

was breathing quickly—perhaps with a just and natural anger 



‘i do not attempt to excuse it ’ he murmured 



‘i cannot even understand it ’ she pursued   ‘what had i done to you 

how do my private concerns affect you ’



there was a long silence  and then richard said  almost in a whisper 



‘i can make no excuse—i think i must have been mad   when i came to

myself i felt—as if i could kill myself for my brutality to you   all day

the shame of it has been eating into my soul—i feel branded  disgraced 

i cannot rest until you tell me you have forgiven me ’



there was silence again  broken only by the faint warbling of a thrush

singing to his mate in the warm dusk 



‘you ask a great deal ’ said rosalie at last   ‘i scarcely know how i can

forgive you ’



she saw the dark figure sway a little  but he spoke quietly 



‘i can only say that i would give my life to recall those insulting words

of mine ’



‘words ’ she repeated   ‘words count for little   that you should think

of me thus—that you should judge me so harshly ’



he said nothing  the thrush sang on  the liquid notes rising and falling

with almost unendurable sweetness 



then  ‘i entreat you ’ he pleaded once more   ‘i entreat you to forgive

me ’



she stretched out her hand in silence  and he took it without a word  it

was cold  very cold  and it trembled 



she drew it away almost as soon as his fingers had closed upon it  and he

turned and went away  his footsteps falling with unaccustomed heaviness

on the little path  and presently the gate swung to behind him 



isaac was sitting by the dying fire  a foot resting on either hob  and

surrounded by a haze of tobacco smoke  when his nephew entered   he

looked towards richard with an aggrieved expression as he crossed the

room 



‘well  them there legs o’ yourn should be pretty well stretched by now 

i was wonderin’ whether you were comin’ back at all to night   where have

ye been all this while ’



richard hesitated  and then  throwing back his head  answered

deliberately 



‘i’ve been to see mrs  fiander ’



‘what  to littlecomb at this time o’ night   what ever took ’ee there so

late ’



‘why  to tell you the truth  i went to make an apology to mrs  fiander 

she came across the top field to day when i was ploughing  and i said

something which hurt her feelings—in fact  i offended her very much  and

i felt i could not rest to night without begging her pardon ’



‘oh ’ said the farmer  and then paused  eyes and mouth round with

astonished concern   ‘well ’ he continued presently  ‘i’m glad as ye

’polygised   i’m very glad as ye ’polygised  richard   ’ees  that was

very well done of ’ee   but what did you go for to offend her for ’



he leaned forward  anxious wrinkles still furrowing his brow  and

puckering up his mouth as though he was going to whistle   by and by 

indeed  he did actually whistle under his breath and without any regard

for tune   richard  meanwhile  stood looking down into the fire as though

he had not heard the question 



‘eh ’ hinted his uncle at last 



‘oh  i beg your pardon   i can’t think  i’m sure  how i came to forget

myself so   i was out of temper  i suppose ’



‘ah ’ commented the farmer   ‘well  i can say truly as she and me ha’

never had a word  not since i knowed her   nay  not so much as one word 

we did al’ays get on wonderful well in ’lias’ time  and now i do really

think as we gets on better than ever ’



‘so you ought to ’ said richard  a trifle irritably  then he added in a

softer tone  ‘i don’t believe anyone could quarrel with you  uncle

isaac ’



‘well  d’ ye see ’ explained isaac  waving his pipe impressively  ‘even

if i was a quarrelsome man—which i bain’t—i never should ax to quarrel

wi’ she   i’m oncommon fond o’ mrs  f  ’



to this richard made no rejoinder   stretching out his foot he pushed the

logs together  and then stood looking down at them again 



‘i’m sorry  richard  as ye should ha’ hurt her feelings ’ went on the

farmer  after ruminating for some time in evident distress of mind   ‘ah 

i be very sorry for that  but ye could n’t do no more nor ’polygise  nay 

ye could n’t do more nor that   i’m glad ye did ’polygise  richard ’



‘so am i ’ said richard huskily  adding  with the same irritation which

he had previously displayed  ‘not that it makes much difference one way

or the other ’



‘’t is a bad thing ’ went on the farmer  ‘for to hurt a woman’s feelin’s

in the beginning of acquaintance  it makes a bad start  d’ ye see   it do

rouse up notions as they’d maybe never ha’ thought on if they was n’t

crossed in the beginning   now my poor mother—your grandmother 

richard—she did have sich tender feelin’s there was no livin’ in th’

house wi’ her   and my father—ah  i’ve heard ’en tell the tale many a

time—he did always set it down to his not havin’ been careful to keep the

right side o’ her when they was a coortin’   ’twas this way  d’ ye see 

my father was a bit of a buck in his day  an’ a’most up to the time when

he had his banns put up wi’ my mother he liked to have his fling  d’ye

see   he’d walk o’ one sunday wi’ one maid  and the next maybe he’d go

along wi’ another  and the third maybe he’d go a fishin’  and there’d be

my poor mother wi’ her best bonnet on all the time a lookin’ out for ’en

so anxious   and she got that upset in her feelin’s  and that nervous  ye

know  that she was n’t the better for it all her life after   ah  i’ve

heard my father say often when she’d scratched his face for him  or

thrown his hat into the wash tub  “’t is my own fault ” he ’d say  “i did

n’t use to consider her feelin’s as a young ’un  and her feelin’s is

a comin’ agen me now ”’



isaac shook his head slowly over this affecting reminiscence  and

restored his pipe to its favourite corner   richard said nothing for a

moment  but presently turned towards his uncle with a smile 



‘don’t you be afraid  uncle isaac   mrs  fiander’s temper is perfect  i

am sure   i was entirely in fault to day  and i will promise most

faithfully not to do anything which might disturb your peace of mind in

future ’



though he spoke with assumed lightness  there was an earnest look in his

eyes 







chapter vi





    some friendship is feigning  most loving mere folly 

                then heigh  ho  the holly 

                this life is most jolly 



                                                              shakespeare 



when sunday came round isaac sharpe surprised his nephew by inviting him

to accompany him on his usual visit to littlecomb 



‘i don’t think you want me ’ said richard  colouring and hesitating  ‘i

should only be in the way   two are company  and three are none  you

know ’



‘nay now  ’t is a silly notion that   “the more the merrier ” i say 

besides  i have particular reasons for wanting you to come to day   you

and mrs  f  have n’t met since that night as ye ’polygised  have ye ’



‘no ’ said richard 



‘and i noticed you hung behind when i was talkin’ to her arter church

this mornin’   was ’ee ashamed o’ meetin’ her ’



‘that’s about it ’ said richard 



‘nay  but that will never do   if ye go on a hangin’ back  and a keepin’

out o’ her way  things will get awk’arder and awk’arder a tween ye   now 

take my advice and come along wi’ i quite quiet and nat’ral  it’ll all

pass off so easy as ye could wish   just drop in same as myself   i want

’ee to be friends ’



‘well  i can’t refuse if you put it like that ’ said marshall   and the

two sallied forth together 



in spite of mr  sharpe’s prognostication  there was decidedly a little

awkwardness about the young people’s meeting   rosalie greeted richard

somewhat stiffly  and invited him with formal politeness to take a seat 



‘’t is a fine day ’ began isaac  as he installed himself in the

high backed elbow chair which had now become his by consecrated right 

rosalie responded hastily that it was a very fine day 



‘ah ’ remarked the farmer  with a covert note of warning in his voice 

‘my nevvy was a sayin’ as we come along that it was a wonderful fine day

for the time o’ year—did n’t ’ee  richard ’



as it happened to be the time of year when fine days were not uncommon 

this alleged observation would not have testified to any extraordinary

perspicacity on richard’s part  but as a matter of fact it was entirely

fictitious   nevertheless the young man did not repudiate it 



‘yes ’ he said  with his eyes on the floor  ‘yes  to be sure ’



‘did n’t ’ee find it oncommon warm in church  mrs  f  ’ pursued mr 

sharpe  after a short silence 



‘yes  i did ’ agreed she   ‘i was longing for someone to open the door ’



‘mrs  f  d’ say ’ cried isaac  turning to his nephew with an explanatory

bawl  which was intended to stimulate him to further efforts at

conversation—‘mrs  f  d’ say  richard  as she found it oncommon warm in

church ’



richard’s eyes travelled slowly from the carpet to his uncle’s face 

where they rested  for the life of him he could not muster courage to

move them to the blooming face on the other side 



‘oh ’ he commented faintly  ‘did she ’



‘’ees ’ said isaac emphatically  ‘do ’ee ax her—’  here he jerked his

thumb significantly in rosalie’s direction   ‘she d’ say as she was

a wishin’ as somebody ’ud open the door—did n’t ’ee  my dear ’



‘yes  indeed ’ said rosalie 



‘ah  she’ll tell ’ee about that  richard ’ went on isaac  and his

enormous boot came slowly sliding across the floor till it reached

richard’s foot  which it proceeded to kick in an admonitory fashion 

‘jist ax her about that—if ye’d ha’ known she was wantin’ the door open

you’d ha’ opened it fast enough for mrs  f   would n’t ’ee  richard ’



‘certainly ’ responded marshall  with his eyes still glued on his uncle’s

face 



‘ah  you can jist talk about that ’ hinted the latter  as he proceeded to

search in his pocket for his pipe 



a dead silence ensued   isaac looked from one to the other  and the

perspiration stood upon his brow   his strenuous efforts had exhausted

him  but the desired consummation seemed just as far off as ever 



‘have you got your tobacco box  uncle isaac ’ inquired the dutiful nephew

presently 



‘let me give you a light ’ said rosalie 



there they were again   what was the good of their talking to him   he

wanted them to talk to each other 



‘richard ’ said isaac  after sucking for a moment at his pipe—when

rosalie applied the match a flash of inspiration had come to

him—‘richard  my boy  ye have n’t been round this here farm since ye come

home  have ’ee ’



‘no ’ said richard  ‘but i know it well of old ’



‘ah  but there’s been improvement since ye left—there’s been a many

improvements   ye’d better take him round  mrs  f   and show him all

what’s been done the last few years   he be oncommon fond o’ stretching

his legs—richard be—and it’ll just suit him—won’t it  richard ’



richard stammered confusedly that he should like it of all things 



‘and you be a wonderful one for fresh air yourself  mrs  f  ’ went on the

diplomatist   ‘jist take ’en out and show ’en everything  there’s a good

soul ’



rosalie had risen willingly enough  for she had found the previous

constraint exceedingly uncomfortable  but she now paused hesitatingly 



‘are n’t you coming  mr  sharpe ’



‘nay  my dear  i’ll stay where i be   ’t is very comfortable here i’ th’

chimney corner  and i bain’t so young as i was  d’ ye see   nay  you two

young folks can go out and freshen yourselves up a bit  and make

acquaintance  and the wold man will bide at home  and smoke his pipe  and

be ready for tea when you come back ’



he nodded at them both with an air of finality  and twisted round his

chair so as to present to their gaze a large and inflexible back 



‘well  then  we had better start if we are to be back by tea time ’ said

rosalie  a little sharply  and richard took up his hat  and followed her

out in silence 



the whole place was wrapped in sabbath stillness  milking was over  and a

distant line of red and dappled cows was vanishing down the lane 

followed by one or two of the dairy ‘chaps ’ with white pinners

protecting their sunday clothes   save for the calves  which thrust their

blunt  moist noses through the bars of their enclosure  and the fowl

cackling lazily as they lay sunning themselves in the angle of the barn 

the barton was absolutely deserted 



‘we drained the big mead four years ago ’ said rosalie  ‘and threw the

twenty acre into it  ’t is beautiful pasture now   would you like to see

it ’



richard hurriedly expressed a desire to that effect  and the two betook

themselves in silence along a narrow farm track to the rear of the house 

which led to the field in question   they walked with the breadth of the

lane between them  and in unbroken silence  their eyes  by common accord 

gazing straight in front  and both secretly rebelling against the

expedient which isaac had deemed so happily devised   at length they came

to a gate set in the hedge  and turned to look over it   a great green

expanse stretched away before their gaze  meeting the sky line on one

side where it sloped upwards  and melting on the other into the lighter 

more delicate green of springing corn  beyond were the woods  which  as

well as the low line of hills behind them  were covered by a gentle haze 



richard leaned his elbows on the topmost rail of the gate  and his face

gradually cleared as his eyes roamed over the landscape 



this county of dorset has given birth to more than one great writer of

lowly origin  whose early nurture amid field  and heath  and woodland has

fostered an intimate and loving sympathy with nature  to which each in

turn has given exquisite expression   richard marshall  born of the same

sturdy peasant stock  brought up amid the same pastoral surroundings 

possessed a somewhat kindred spirit  though he was denied this gift of

expression   yet the inglorious rustic milton was not always mute  he had

read so much  and meditated so much  and  above all  felt so deeply  that

at times something of what he thought and felt struggled to his lips and

found vent in words  inadequate  indeed  but suggestive 



‘how beautiful it all is ’ he said  turning to rosalie  with a very

poet’s rapture in his eyes   ‘it seems to fill one like music ’



‘yet i suppose you have seen far finer sights during your travels ’

returned she  speaking naturally for the first time  as she too leaned

over the gate 



‘finer things   oh  yes  perhaps  but this homely beauty touches me as no

other sight could do   something about a great sketch of green like this

always affects me curiously   i love these wide fields ’



‘yes  i remember your saying so ’ said rosalie   the ice was broken now

and she could talk to him freely  even taking courage to broach a subject

which had much occupied her thoughts lately   ‘you told me  you know  how

pleased you were at the sight of the cornfield in—in my picture ’



he did not turn towards her  and continued to scan the mead  but over his

brown face she saw the colour rush quickly 



‘oh  yes ’ he said  ‘of course i remember telling you about it ’



‘i wanted to ask you was—was the picture a very large one  and was it

well painted ’



‘yes  very large indeed  and beautifully painted   there was an iron

railing in front of it because people pressed round it so   i was told it

was the picture of the year ’



‘was it ’ cried rosalie  and at the note of delight in her voice he

turned and looked at her with a smile   her cheeks were pink with

excitement  her eyes shining   ‘oh ’ she cried  with a sigh of longing 

‘i would give anything to see it ’



‘i have a little print of it here ’ returned he impulsively  ‘i cut it

out of a paper   it will give you some idea of it  though of course a

very poor one ’



in another moment he partly withdrew from its enclosure the print in

question  holding the envelope firmly in his own hand  however  so that

the charred margin was hidden 



‘see ’ he said  pointing with his disengaged hand  ‘there is your

house—over there in the corner  and here are your men  and here  under

the piled up sheaves  are you   but of course the figure in the picture

is far more like you ’



‘i see ’ said rosalie   ‘yes  it must be a nice picture  and you say it

is beautifully done ’



‘it is beautifully done   it is so real  so vivid  that i felt as if i

could walk into the picture   these sheaves stand out so that one might

think it easy to pass behind them ’



he glanced up as he said these words  and was surprised to see rosalie

colour almost to the temples   his own heart gave a sudden throb   was it

possible that she had divined the audacious thought which had so often

come to him as he recalled that picture  and which  since his uncle’s

revelations  he had resolutely striven to banish 



as a matter of fact there did happen to be a certain similarity between

this thought of his and that which had caused rosalie to change colour 

for there had flashed across her mind the remembrance of the unknown

artist’s words  ‘perhaps if i come across a very attractive specimen of a

rustic i may place him just behind the stook ’



‘this is the name underneath  i suppose ’ she said hastily   ‘what is the

picture called   i cannot see from here ’



‘it is called “a sleeping beauty ”’ returned richard 



she was dumb for a moment  hot waves of colour rushing over brow and

neck   what was it the man had said last year   ‘you will wake up some

day  my beauty ’  words of ill omen   they had often tantalised and

tormented her  but now  as they recurred to her  her heart seemed to

stand still   ashamed of her burning face  on which the young man’s eyes

were now fixed  and of the agitation which she could not master  she

suddenly bent forward confusedly 



‘what is the name of the painter   let me look ’



before richard could divine her intention she had snatched the print from

his hand  its black and jagged edges immediately catching her eye 



‘why ’ she said in an altered tone—‘why  it is burnt ’



it was now richard’s turn to look confused   ‘i began to burn it  but

repented of my intention ’



‘you wanted to burn it ’ said rosalie  ‘because you were so angry with

me   why were you so angry with me   was it because of—of what your uncle

told you ’



‘yes ’



‘i know he did not mean to do me harm ’ said rosalie tremulously  ‘but i

don’t think he—he can have made you understand properly   everything was

going wrong  and—and i was so much bothered  i found i could not manage

by myself  and he had been my poor elias’s friend’—she was beginning to

sob now—‘and i knew i could trust him not to do anything elias would n’t

have liked  and—oh  it is so difficult to explain ’



‘pray do not try to explain ’ said richard very gently 



‘but you should n’t misjudge me as you do ’ cried she  and then burst

into tears 



‘i do not misjudge you now ’ said richard in a low voice   ‘oh  don’t

cry   i assure you i understand   you have been quite right—quite right

all along ’



the big tearful blue eyes looked at him over the crumpled handkerchief 



‘but you said—you said i sold myself ’ she gasped   ‘you should n’t have

said that   i loved my husband ’



‘i am sure you did ’ said richard gravely and tenderly 



‘yes  indeed i did   i loved him from the first   he was like a father to

me ’



‘yes  yes ’ said richard  and he looked at her with an odd mixture of

wonder and compassion 



‘he was just as kind and dotingly fond of me as my own dear granfer ’



‘to be sure ’ said richard   ‘yes  no wonder you loved him ’



something in his tone caused rosalie to pull down her handkerchief and to

cast a keen glance at him 



‘why do you look at me like that ’ she said passionately 



‘was i looking at you in any particular way ’ returned he  averting his

eyes quickly 



‘yes  you were   you were looking at me as if you were sorry for me   how

dare you be sorry for me ’



‘were you not telling me ’ he said quietly  ‘how much you felt the loss

of your good old husband ’



‘you know it was not that ’ she retorted   ‘you looked at me as if i were

a child who had no sense—as if i did not know what i was saying ’



‘did i ’ said richard   ‘i beg your pardon ’



‘is that what you really think of me ’ pursued she  her eyes full of

wrathful fire  though the tears were still standing on her cheeks 

‘answer me—i insist on your answering me ’



richard’s gaze had been fixed on the little print which she was holding 

and rosalie  marking this  had felt an increase of indignation   did he

dare to share the opinion which the artist had so impertinently

pronounced   rousing himself  however  he turned towards her  and their

eyes met 



‘i do think ’ he said  ‘that you know very little of life   perhaps it is

all the better for you   the fruit of the tree of knowledge is nearly

always bitter—and sometimes it is poisonous ’



rosalie was about to make a very angry rejoinder when the sound of steps

close to them made them both suddenly start  on looking round they beheld

a loving couple  such as are so frequently to be met with in rural

districts on sunday afternoons  sauntering down the lane 



rosalie hastily restored her handkerchief to her pocket  and again leaned

over the gate  endeavouring to assume a careless attitude  but she was

secretly much annoyed  for the young man who was so gallantly escorting a

much befringed and beribboned lady was no other than sam belbin   at any

other time she would have been somewhat amused on discovering how soon

her lowly admirer had consoled himself   he was working at branston now 

and his companion was evidently a townswoman  but that he should come on

her just then  in the midst of her tears and wrath  with richard marshall

in such close proximity  was most vexatious 



sam stared hard as he approached  taking in  as rosalie felt though she

did not again look towards him  every compromising detail of the

situation   when they had passed on he made some facetious remark to the

girl on whose arm he was hanging  to which she responded by loud

laughter 



the little incident impressed rosalie disagreeably  she turned to richard

petulantly  holding out the little print which had been the cause of so

much agitation 



‘you had better finish burning this ’ she said 



‘perhaps i had ’ returned he  with unexpected docility 



isaac looked so placid and cheery when they entered  and greeted them

with so bright a smile  that rosalie was conscious of a sudden rush of

remorse 



going up to him she placed her hand upon his shoulder  a caress which

astonished its recipient mightily  for he was not accustomed to

endearments from her   rosalie kept her hand there  however  glancing

defiantly at richard the while  as though to say  ‘you are wrong in

thinking me so ignorant  see how i love and appreciate this good man ’

and richard smiled back kindly  as if replying  ‘i see it  indeed  and i

am glad that you are content ’



‘well ’ said isaac  squinting down sideways at rosalie’s hand   ‘well 

mrs  f   did you take ’en all over the place ’



‘i took mr  marshall to see the big mead ’ returned she  a little

doubtfully 



‘ah  i’m sure he thought that improved   well  and then you took ’en up

to see the root crop ’



‘no—no  we did n’t go there  we did n’t like to go too far  as you were

here by yourself ’



‘why  i were all right ’  here isaac slowly lifted the shoulder on which

rosalie’s hand still lingered  and again glanced down at it   as  taking

the hint  she withdrew it  he gently rubbed the place where it had

rested 



‘you took ’en down to the carnfield  though ’ he continued   ‘i’ll engage

he thought them oats was a comin’ on wonderful ’



but they had not been to the cornfield  it appeared  nor yet to see the

potatoes  nor round by the vegetable garden  nor through the orchard 

they had just been to the big mead and back 



‘well ’ commented mr  sharpe  gazing at them in amazement  ‘ye must ha’

walked oncommon slow ’



‘we stood for some time looking at the view ’ said richard  seeing

rosalie somewhat confounded 



‘lookin’ at the view  eh ’ echoed his uncle   ‘there bain’t any view to

speak on from the mead   if you’d ha’ gone a bit further up the lane and

turned the corner ye’d ha’ had a beautiful view o’ branston   but if you

enj’yed yourselves it’s all right ’



he wheeled round in his chair as he made this last remark  and looked

from one to the other of the young folks   both faces were alike

downcast  and somewhat paler than usual   after a moment’s scrutiny isaac

became as crestfallen as they 



‘so long as you enj’yed yourselves ’ he repeated slowly   ‘so long as

ye’ve a made friends—i want ’ee to be friends  d’ ye see ’



rosalie and richard glanced at each other   he read in her face a kind of

antagonism mingled with fear  and dropped his eyes quickly lest they

might betray the anguish and longing with which his heart was full to

bursting 



‘i want ’ee to be friends  d’ ye see ’ repeated the farmer anxiously and

pleadingly   ‘there’s me and you  mrs  f   as friendly as can be  and

there’s you and me  richard—you’re much the same’s a son to me  bain’t

ye —well  then there’s you and mrs  f   why should n’t ’ee be friendly

wi’ her ’



richard  to whom the question was directed  remained dumb    friends  

could they ever be friends 



rosalie  however  made a step forward and extended her hand 



‘why should we not  indeed ’ she said   ‘to tell you the truth  isaac  we

have done nothing but quarrel since we first met each other  which was

very silly and unreasonable of us   now  for your sake i am determined

not to quarrel any more  and for your sake  i think  he too should be

willing to keep the peace ’



‘well said ’ cried isaac heartily   ‘well said  mrs  f    now  richard 

my boy  where’s your hand   just catch hold o’ mrs  f ’s   that’s

it—that’s it   shake it well ’  here he thumped the arm of his chair

jubilantly   ‘you’ll be the best o’ friends from this day for’ard   here

we be  we three  friends all   jist as me and poor ’lias and mrs  f  was

friends—dear heart alive  yes  we was friends too—the best o’ friends 

we was three then  and we be three now  bain’t us  mrs  f    we three   i

do mind a old song as your poor dear mother used to sing  richard 



    ‘when shall we three meet agen 

    in starm  in zunshine  ar in rain ’



lard  yes  she used to sing it  poor soul   well  now we be three agen 

bain’t us   three good friends   so  if you’ll mix the usu’l glass  mrs 

f   we’ll drink to the bond o’ good fellowship ’



‘yes  of course ’ said rosalie indistinctly   ‘i forgot all about your

glass  isaac  i’m so sorry  i’ll see to it at once ’



she ran out of the room  glad to make her escape  and richard sat down

near the hearth 



friends   they were to be friends as his uncle  and elias  and rosalie

had once been friends   he had felt her hand twitch in his as isaac had

spoken  to her the proposition was doubtless as distasteful as to him it

was impossible   what was his uncle thinking of   there were some things

which flesh and blood—young flesh and blood—could not brook  and this

triangular bond was one of them   but he would be patient for a little

while  he would choke down his rebellious sense of injury   his secret 

thank heaven  was secure  neither the guileless isaac nor rosalie herself

had the faintest idea of the miserable passion which he was striving so

hard to conquer   what was it she had said   they were to be

friends—friends for his uncle’s sake   his uncle  to whom he owed

everything—his kind  faithful  generous old benefactor   well  he would

try 



that night  in the seclusion of his attic room  he once more drew forth

rosalie’s picture 



‘sleep on  beauty ’ he said   ‘sleep on in peace   i shall not try to

wake you   sleep soundly  do not even dream ’



and  after a last silent look  he held it steadily in the flame of the

candle  watching its destruction unflinchingly until the last feathery

film dropped from his fingers 







chapter vii





    and times he saith  ‘why must man aye forego 

    and why is life a nobler thing through pain ’

    and times  ‘since love’s sweet apple hangs so low 

    shall i not strongly grasp and count it gain ’



                                                          elinor sweetman 



for some time after isaac’s apparently successful peace making the

friendly relations between the parties concerned remained unbroken 

richard was frequently sent on messages to littlecomb  acquitting himself

on these occasions in a strictly business like manner  and when he

accompanied his uncle thither he made such strenuous efforts to appear at

his ease and to entertain its hostess that isaac was delighted beyond

measure 



‘how th’ chap d’ talk ’ he would say sometimes under his breath  with an

admiring nod and wink   ‘bless me  he d’ talk like prent   i d’ ’low

there is n’t very much as my nevvy don’t know ’



richard  indeed  in his desire to avoid those terrible long silences

which had so much discomposed him during his first visits to littlecomb 

embarked upon wild flights of fancy  related at length his past

experiences  and delivered his opinion upon men and things with a fluency

which frequently surprised himself   the fact was that he was afraid to

pause  were he to come to a halt when those blue eyes were fixed upon

him  could he ever take up the thread of his discourse again   even as it

was  the mere consciousness of that intent gaze made him sometimes

falter  but  recovering himself  he would go on with a rush  knowing that

he was making many wild statements  but persevering nevertheless   he was

bound to do all the talking  if talking there must be  for rosalie was

very silent  and his uncle was at no time garrulous 



but the harmony of these relations was rudely broken by an unexpected

incident 



one warm afternoon  early in june  farmer sharpe chanced to be standing

by his own gate  gazing abstractedly up and down the lane   presently he

descried an undersized  narrow chested figure making its way towards him 

and  as it drew near  recognised mr  samuel cross 



‘fine evenin’ ’ remarked isaac  nodding sideways in his direction  and

expecting him to pass on 



‘a very fine evening  mr  sharpe ’ returned samuel  pausing  and leaning

against the gatepost  with the evident intention of entering into

conversation   ‘the very evenin’ for a quiet walk ’



‘walkin’ bain’t much in my line ’ returned isaac   ‘nay  not without i’m

obliged to—seein’ after the men and goin’ round the fields  and across

the downs to look after the sheep  but walkin’—meanin’ goin’ for a walk

jist for pleasure—it bain’t in my line at all ’



‘it’s in other people’s line  though ’ said samuel  and he shot a cunning

glance at the older man out of his little red rimmed eyes   ‘i met your

nephew strolling up towards littlecomb just now ’



‘very like ye did ’ agreed sharpe   ‘he do often go up there on

business ’



‘lucky chap ’ exclaimed cross   ‘the rest of us don’t often contrive to

make business agree so well with pleasure ’



he paused to snigger  and isaac turned his mild grey eyes inquiringly

upon him 



‘nay  samuel cross ’ he remarked  ‘i don’t suppose as  you  do ’



the slight stress laid upon the personal pronoun appeared to irritate the

young gentleman  and he replied with a certain acerbity 



‘there is n’t  as a rule  much pleasure to be found in doing honest

business  mr  sharpe ’



‘not among lawyers ’ said isaac  nodding placidly   ‘so i’ve been told ’



‘there’s others besides lawyers  though ’ cried samuel  ‘as are n’t so

very honest   he  he   you’re a very confiding man  mr  sharpe—a very

confiding uncle   ’t is n’t everyone in your situation that would care to

make such a handsome young man his business manager where a handsome

young woman was concerned   he  he   your nephew  no doubt  will do the

business thoroughly—perhaps a little too thoroughly ’



‘my nevvy ’ returned isaac loftily  ‘may be trusted to do his dooty 

sam’el   ’t is more nor can be said for many folks as be all for pokin’

their noses where they bain’t wanted ’



mr  cross’s always sallow complexion assumed an even more jaundiced hue

as he retorted 



‘most people do no business on sunday—in england they don’t at least  but

i suppose mr  richard marshall has brought foreign notions back with him 

he was seen two or three weeks ago doing  business  with mrs  fiander

quite as per usual   they were standin’ close together lookin’ over a

gate  just as if he and she were keepin’ company   and he was tellin’ her

such touchin’ business details that she was actually crying  mr  sharpe ’



‘cryin’ ’ ejaculated isaac  in a kind of roar   ‘stuff and nonsense 

what had she to cry for ’



‘how should i know   because prices had gone down  i suppose  since 

according to you  they talk nothing but business when they are together ’



‘oh  drop that ’ cried the farmer  losing patience at last   ‘what be you

a drivin’ at  sam’el cross  wi’ your hints ’



‘why ’ rejoined samuel  thrusting his thumbs into his waistcoat

pockets—‘why  the remark as was passed by the young man that saw them in

the lane will perhaps throw some light on the subject   says he  “i

believe ” he says  “as the widow fiander be a takin’ on wi’ the new love

before she is off wi’ the old ”  so if i do drop a hint  mr  sharpe’—and

samuel assumed a virtuous air  and struck an appropriate attitude—‘i do

it in the way of kindness   take my advice and look sharp—look like your

name  sir   we lawyers see a deal of the world  a deal of the wickedness

of the world  and we know that worthy folks are often caught napping 

but don’t you be caught  farmer—keep a good look out  or your bride will

be snapped up from under your very nose ’



‘now i’ll tell you what it is  sam’el cross ’ cried isaac  who had been

shifting from one foot to the other during the latter part of the clerk’s

speech  and was purple in the face with suppressed ire  ‘since you’re so

fond of advice maybe you’ll take a bit from me   jist you keep that long

tongue o’ yourn quiet   what do ye mean  ye little treecherous spy  by

poking your nose into other people’s business and tryin’ to make mischief

between them that’s as good as father and son   i know my nevvy a deal

better than you know him   my nevvy bain’t a snapper  an’ so i tell ’ee 

now you jist take yourself off out of this  and don’t ’ee come here wi’

no more lyin’ tales  else maybe ye’ll find this here stick o’ mine laid

about your shoulders   i bain’t so strong as i were  but i could make a

shift to hit ’ee a crack or two—so now ye know ’



samuel had started back as words and gestures grew threatening  and now

deemed it better to beat a retreat  turning  however  at a safe distance

to bestow a withering valedictory smile upon his adversary  and to remark

that he was sorry for him 



ever since his rejection by rosalie he had been burning with resentment

against her  and desirous of an opportunity of venting it   a chance

meeting with sam belbin had resulted in the latter’s imparting to him a

highly coloured version of the scene which he had witnessed between

rosalie and richard in the lane   the desired opportunity seemed to have

arrived  and samuel had hastened to take advantage of it  with  as has

been seen  indifferent success   as he now hastened away as rapidly as

his short legs would carry him he encountered the very person he had been

so anxious to traduce   richard nodded  and would have passed on  but

that cross  who was still suffering from a redundancy of spite  thought

the opportunity favourable for venting it 



‘you are back already ’ he remarked   ‘i wonder you did n’t contrive to

be a bit longer over your  business    you would n’t ha’ been missed

yonder   your uncle seems quite content with your doings   as i told him

just now—he has a confiding nature ’



‘what do you mean ’ said richard  speaking in a low even voice  but with

an ominous flash of the eyes 



‘ha  you know what i mean well enough  you sly young dog   if you don’t 

ask the fascinating young widow—ask lovely  dainty mrs  f   she knows

what she’s about  though she contrives to look so demure   come ’ marking

the expression of richard’s face  ‘you need n’t turn rusty over it—i’ll

tell no tales  bless you   but there’s others besides me that has been

passing remarks about the widow fiander’s new business manager   ha 

ha —you may carry on  though  as far as i am concerned—perhaps i know a

little too much about the lady to envy you  she has played a double game

before now   as for the old man   he’ll  find out nothing  he’s as blind

as a bat—as blind as a bat ’



here mr  cross thrust his tongue into his cheek  and made a hideous

contortion of countenance calculated to convey an impression of his own

extreme artfulness and of his contempt for the old farmer’s

short sightedness 



his own vision  perhaps  might with advantage have been a little clearer 

a man of quicker perceptions would have realised that richard’s

persistent silence was more fraught with danger to him than a torrent of

wrathful words   he was  therefore  considerably surprised when marshall

suddenly brought down his vigorous right hand upon the cheek at that

moment distended by samuel’s malevolent tongue  and  before he had time

to spring backwards  the other palm inflicted similar chastisement on its

fellow 



the lawyer’s clerk gasped  spluttered  and finally uttered a choking

howl 



‘hang you   you’ve made me nearly bite my tongue off ’



‘serve you right if i had ’ cried richard   ‘you little reptile  if you

so much as say another word of this kind i’ll half kill you ’



he had seized samuel by the shoulders and was now shaking him slowly

backwards and forwards 



‘do you take back every word of your vile slanders ’



‘ye—ye—yes ’ gasped cross  in an agony of terror 



‘will you give me your word to keep that foul tongue of yours quiet in

future ’



‘oh lord  yes  richard marshall   for heaven’s sake let me go   you’ve

about half killed me as it is ’



richard released him with a parting admonition to look out  and cross

went on his way with a staggering gait  and stuffing his

pocket handkerchief into his mouth 



richard  still in a white heat of passion  was striding along at a

tremendous rate  when he suddenly observed the large white clad person of

his uncle standing contemplatively some twenty yards away from the scene

of the encounter   his good humoured face wore a pleasant and satisfied

smile 



‘well done  lad ’ he remarked  as soon as richard came within hearing 

‘ye did give it ’en in style   i never did see nothing more neat   i do

rather think  richard  as mr  sam’el cross ’ull have the toothache   i d’

’low he will ’



‘i only wish i had made every bone in his body ache ’ cried richard 

still fuming 



‘i d’ ’low as he said something as ann’yed ’ee  richard ’ said the

farmer  ceasing his placid chuckles and looking intently at his nephew 



‘yes ’ returned richard  ‘he annoyed me very much   he—in point of fact 

he insulted me ’



‘well  now ’ commented isaac  ‘that was strange   i did n’t think he’d

insult ’ee to your face  richard   he was a talkin’ to me jist now  and

he did say some very insultin’ things agen you—but that was behind your

back  d’ ye see   i did n’t think the chap would acshally go for to say

’em to your face ’



‘what did he say of me ’ said richard breathlessly 



‘why  he did say redic’lous things about you and mrs  f   ah  the little

raskil could n’t so much as leave mrs  f ’s name out   and he were very

oncivil to me—ye ’d scarce believe how oncivil he were   up and told me

straight out as if i did n’t look out you’d be snappin’ up mrs  f 

without “by your leave ” or “with your leave ”  but i give it ’en back

well  i can tell ’ee   says i  “my nevvy bain’t a snapper ” says i   them

was my very words   “ye little treecherous spy ” i says  “don’t ’ee be

a pokin’ your nose into other folks’ business   i know my nevvy ” i says 

“and my nevvy bain’t a snapper ”’



here isaac paused to chuckle jubilantly  and  turning  slapped his nephew

jovially on the back 



‘what do you think of that for an answer  eh ’



‘why  that it was an excellent one ’ said richard  beginning to stride on

again so rapidly that his uncle could scarcely keep pace with him 



‘and i told him too ’ pursued the latter  ‘that if he came agen with sich

lyin’ tales i’d lay my stick about his shoulders ’



‘i’m glad you said that ’ exclaimed the young man without turning his

head   ‘i’m glad you told him they were lying tales   they  are  lying

tales ’



‘and the stick ’ isaac reminded him with modest triumph   ‘i reckon i

brought it in rather neat about the stick   says i  “i bain’t quite so

young as i were  but i could make shift to hit ’ee a crack or two yet ”’



‘i wish i had thrashed him within an inch of his life ’ came the savage

comment thrown over richard’s shoulder 



‘lard  richard  how you do lay them long legs o’ yourn to the ground ’

panted isaac  pausing to wipe his brow   ‘i’m fair out o’ breath   bide a

bit—bide a bit  let me blow   there  don’t ’ee be in sich a takin’  lad 

i reckon them there little taps as ye gave sam’el cross ’ull keep ’en

quiet for some time   he be gone t’other way  anyhow  and it won’t do ’ee

no good to run me off my legs ’



richard came slowly back  his face was fixed and stern  but he spoke more

quietly 



‘uncle  i blame myself to a certain extent for what has happened   i

might have guessed that in a gossiping little place like this people

would talk if i went so often to littlecomb   i must keep away altogether

for the present ’



‘nay now  don’t ’ee let yourself get so upset   what signifies a bit of

idle chatter   you don’t need to take no notice of it at all ’



‘but i will take notice of it ’ cried richard   ‘i don’t choose that

people should take liberties with my name  and what is worse—with hers 

i need not assure you  uncle isaac  that i have never said one word to

mrs  fiander that anyone need find fault with ’



‘to be sure ’ agreed isaac  ‘of course not ’  he came to a sudden pause 

however  and cast a sidelong look at his nephew  scratching his jaw

meditatively   ‘there was one day—one sunday—sam’el cross was a sayin’ 

somebody seed you both standin’ a lookin’ over a gate  and mrs  f  was

a cryin’   that was n’t very likely  i don’t think   ’t was n’t very

likely as you’d say aught as ’ud make mrs  f  cry ’



richard drew a quick breath  and his hands involuntarily clenched

themselves 



‘she did cry one day ’ he said   ‘it was the first sunday you took me to

littlecomb   she imagined’—hesitatingly—‘that i had a bad opinion of her 

and she cried  and said i was unjust ’



‘that’ll be the day you went to see the big mead ’ said farmer sharpe

reflectively   ‘ye had n’t made friends then   ye have n’t made her cry

since  richard  have ’ee ’



‘of course not ’



‘women be so fanciful   ye did n’t really have a bad opinion of her 

richard ’



‘far from it ’



‘she be a very dear woman—a very dear woman   ’t is n’t very likely as

anybody ’ud have a bad opinion of mrs  f   well  ye be real trew friends

now  and ye don’t need to take no notice of idle talk   let there be no

coolness between ye on that account ’



richard  however  remained fixed in his determination to avoid littlecomb

for the future  and in spite of his uncle’s protests adhered to his

resolution   on the following sunday he was somewhat discomposed to find

rosalie’s eyes straying towards him once or twice as he knelt on the

opposite side of the church  and it seemed to him that they wore a

questioning  pleading expression 



his purpose  however  remained unshaken  and immediately after the early

dinner he went out without saying anything to his uncle  and could not be

found when the hour came for their weekly pilgrimage to littlecomb 

after waiting some time  and vainly bellowing his name  the farmer was

obliged to go without him 



richard was in a very taciturn mode at the evening meal  and his uncle’s

announcement that mrs  f  had inquired why he had not come and remarked

that she saw nothing of him nowadays  did not render him more inclined

for conversation   after supper  too  instead of smoking quietly  he sat

fidgeting in his chair for a few minutes  and then  rising hastily  fell

to pacing about the room 



‘you seem mortal onaisy this evening ’ remarked the farmer  after these

perambulations had continued some time   ‘sit down  and light up like a

decent christian ’



he pushed forward a chair invitingly with his foot  and richard took it

and drew his pipe from his pocket 



ugh   how hot and stuffy it was in this kitchen  where  in spite of the

warm weather  a fire was blazing   the windows had not been opened all

day  he felt sure  the odour of their recent repast still lingered in the

air  mingled with the fumes of the particularly rank pipe which his uncle

was then enjoying   he thought of the cool twilight without  of the downs

with the fresh breeze blowing across them  of the path beside the hedge

that led to littlecomb  of the garden there—the garden where the thrush

was singing  and where the roses and syringa were in full bloom   ah  he

could picture to himself the syringa with its white blossoms shining like

pale lamps amid the dusky boughs   the garden still  and sweet  and

dewy—where she was wandering at this hour 



‘light up  man ’ said isaac  pointing to richard’s pipe 



his nephew obeyed  but held it absently between his fingers 



isaac poked the blazing logs with his foot and bent forward  extending

his hands to the glow  his big red face looked unnaturally large through

the surrounding haze of smoke   richard half rose from his chair  and

then sank back again   outside  came the tantalising thought again 

outside—a few paces away  were the downs and the lonely path through the

fields  and then the garden 



the farmer was slowly nodding in the comfortable radiance   richard’s

unused pipe had gone out    the garden     the garden  



suddenly he rose from his chair  strode across the room  flung open the

door  and was gone before his uncle had time to do more than turn his

head 







chapter viii





    away  the moor is dark beneath the moon 

    rapid clouds have drunk the last pale beam of even 

    away  the gathering winds will call the darkness soon 

    and profoundest midnight shroud the serene lights of heaven 

    pause not   the time is past   every voice cries  away 



                                                                  shelley 



once outside  richard flew along as though pursued by a thousand demons 

here were the downs  with their delicious tart air—but he raced across

them without pausing to inhale it  now to swing over the hedge and to

cover the ground that still lay between him and the garden   the garden

and her   his heart was thumping loudly against his ribs  a sound as of a

rushing sea was in his ears   on  on  there were the lights twinkling

from under the dark eaves—there was the gate set in the high wall   how

it shook beneath his violent hand as he flung it open   he stood still at

last  hardly breathing in his suspense   was she there   all was still

save for the rustling of the boughs and the faint warbling of the

birds—more than one was celebrating evensong to night   what if she

should not be there   he walked on  slowly and unsteadily now  and

presently there was a movement amid the greenery close at hand   out of a

little arbour set amid the shrubs a figure came gliding forth to meet

him   she paused two paces away from him and her hands fell by her sides 



‘it is you ’ she said  almost in a whisper 



‘yes  it is i ’



they stood facing each other in unbroken silence for a full minute  and

then she asked  still in that breathless whisper 



‘why did you come ’



‘because i could not keep away ’



she turned and began slowly to pace down the path between the roses 

waves of perfume were wafted to their nostrils from the syringa blossom 

yes  yonder stood the bush just as he had pictured to himself   the

remembrance suddenly flashed across richard as he walked beside her that

these shrubs were sometimes called ‘mock orange trees ’   mock orange

trees     mock orange blossom  —he must not pursue that thought further 



‘i kept away for four days ’ he said suddenly   ‘i tried to keep away

to day ’



after a long pause she faltered 



‘i was wondering why you did not come ’



he made no answer  and they walked in silence till the end of the path

was reached  and then she said  still falteringly 



‘i don’t think you ought to have come now ’



‘i know i ought not ’



they turned and began to retrace their steps  but when about mid way up

the garden she came to a standstill and looked him full in the face 



‘go now ’ she said   ‘go   you must not stay here any longer ’



even in the dim light he could see that she was pale and that her figure

wavered  but he gazed at her as though without realising the sense of her

words 



‘will you not leave me ’ she entreated  ‘when i ask you ’



he stood looking at her stupidly for a moment or two longer  then the

meaning of her request seemed to reach his understanding 



‘i will go ’ he said hoarsely  ‘if you will give me those flowers in your

hand ’



‘how foolish you are ’ she cried   ‘there  yes  take them  and for

heaven’s sake go ’



she thrust them towards him  and he took them from her hand—a cluster of

roses  moist and sweet   instead of fulfilling his promise  however  he

made a step closer to her 



‘will you put them in my coat ’ he asked   his eyes in his haggard face

seemed to burn 



‘no ’ said rosalie  drawing back 



the movement and the icy tone that accompanied it recalled him to

himself   he  too  drew back  hesitated  and then  throwing the flowers

on the ground with a passionate gesture  departed   back again through

the gate  across the yard  under the lea of the hedge  over the downs 



here was home  there was the warm light of the fire by which his uncle

sat   now the door was open  and he stood once more in his presence  now 

he  richard  would be forced to look him in the face 



for a moment he stood with the door handle in his hand  and then  as the

old man turned to smile inquiringly upon him  he suddenly wheeled and

fled 



‘i can’t ’ he cried  as he mounted the stairs   ‘i can’t ’



isaac stared at the closed door for some moments as though expecting it

to open again  then  slowly turning back to the fire  listened 



in the room overhead hasty steps were walking up and down 



‘he be gone to fetch summat  very like ’ remarked the farmer as he

restored his pipe to his mouth   but after smoking and listening a little

longer  and marking that the pacing to and fro continued without

intermission  he jerked his thumb upwards  nodded  and said  ‘he bain’t

a comin’ back ’  then  after pausing a moment to ruminate over this

circumstance  he made up his mind to the inevitable  tapped his pipe upon

the hob  extinguished the lamp  and went upstairs to bed 



and long after he was sunk in dreamless slumbers those hasty footsteps

might have been heard in the adjoining room  pacing up and down  up and

down  like the restless tread of a caged beast 



richard was not the only one who spent an unquiet night   rosalie  too 

could find no rest for her aching heart   after some hours of feverish

tossing she rose  dressed in the dim grey light that was just stealing

over the world  and seated herself by the open window   she could

meditate here without risk of being disturbed  for the sun would not rise

for an hour and more  and even the earliest of her men would not appear

until some time after dawn 



with her chin resting on her hand  she hearkened vaguely to the

succession of sounds which betokened the awakening of nature   the cock

had crowed long before she had left her uneasy pillow  the young sparrows

had been chirping while she had clothed her weary frame  but now the

cuckoo’s note was sounding faintly from a neighbouring copse  and the

starlings were chattering in their nests on the ivied wall   the grey

veil was being gradually withdrawn from the face of the earth  but even

yet familiar objects were only half revealed  and the most well known had

a strange and unreal look 



the first sunbeam had not yet struck across the sky when rosalie  whose

eyes had been absently fixed upon the irregular line of hedge which

marked the approach to the barton  saw a dark object moving slowly along

it  and presently into the open space before her gate there stepped the

figure of a man   she knew what man it was even before he had vaulted the

locked gate and taken up his stand beneath her window   she would have

given worlds to close this window and hasten out of sight  but a spell

seemed to be laid upon her  and she could neither move nor speak  only

gaze downward with dilated frightened eyes 



‘you are there ’ said richard  looking up with a face as drawn and white

as her own   ‘thank god   i wanted to see you before i go   i wanted to

say good bye ’



the power of speech returned to her  and she leaned forth impulsively

with a faint cry   ‘going   you are going ’



‘yes  i am going   is it not the only thing i can do   do you think i can

bear to sit at his table and take his pay  and know that i am a traitor

to him in my heart ’



rosalie did not speak  but richard  gazing upwards  saw the clasp of her

hands tighten  as they rested on the sill  till the nails and knuckles

showed white 



he went on passionately  ‘every word he says to me stabs me   every time

i look at his honest  unsuspicious face i feel—surely you must know what

i feel   i’m not quite a brute yet   and later  when you are his wife—do

you think it would be possible for me to go on living within a stone’s

throw—to see you every day—to keep up the farce of friendship   what do

you think i am made of ’



her face was set like marble  only the eyes moved   after a long pause

she whispered  ‘will you—ever come back ’



‘who knows ’ he answered with a harsh laugh   ‘some time perhaps—when i

am quite old—when i can no longer feel ’



she put her hand before her eyes  and then let it drop   richard saw the

irrepressible anguish in them  and his face changed   he threw up his

arms suddenly with a kind of a sob 



‘i will not go—if you tell me to stay ’



for a moment longer the agonised eyes looked down into his  and he

thought he saw her waver  but it was only for a moment   her lips moved 

at first without emitting any sound  but presently mastering herself  she

said firmly 



‘no  i tell you to go—it is right for you to go ’



‘good bye ’ said richard hoarsely 



‘good bye ’ faltered rosalie  and then there came a great sob  ‘god bless

you ’



he turned as if to leave her  but wheeling round  looked back 



‘am i to have nothing   am i to be sent away without so much as a clasp

of the hand ’



she had vanished from the window  and for a moment he stood holding his

breath  would she come down to him—would she meet him at the door 



but within all was silent 



‘she will not come ’ he said to himself  and once more went on his way 

staggering blindly forward  with his head sunk upon his breast 



had he looked back again he might have seen her creep to the window and

kneel by it  straining her eyes through streaming tears 



poor rosalie   poor beauty   did she wake at last only to look upon the

vanishing form of her prince 



                                           



later in the day isaac sharpe came to littlecomb in great perturbation of

mind   he found rosalie lying on the couch in the parlour  the blind

being drawn down—she had a headache  she said 



‘dear heart alive ’ said isaac  sitting down  a hand on either knee 

‘everything d’ seem to be goin’ wrong this day   here’s my nevvy gone off

wi’ himself ’



‘gone ’ echoed rosalie  faintly  turning her face to the wall 



‘’ees  took himself off this morning wi’out a word to anyone  and left

this here bit of a note for to explain   i bain’t much of a hand at

letter readin’  but bithey did read it for me  and he does n’t seem to

give no excuse at all  except that he were feelin’ restless   he says he

al’ays told me he were a rover  and could n’t settle down  and now the

travellin’ fit have come on him and he felt he must be off   and he

thanks me very handsome  and he tells me he don’t know where he be

a goin’ to yet  but when he does he’ll write and let me know where to

send his luggage   and that’s all ’



that’s all ’ repeated rosalie  looking at the kind  troubled old face

with a bewildered stare   that was all  of course  and she had known it

before   she had with her own eyes watched richard’s departing figure

until it had disappeared from sight   she had known quite well that he

would never return  she had even told him to go  agreed with him that it

was the right and honourable thing to do—the only thing to do   ever

since the morning she had been telling herself so over and over again 

yet none the less the farmer’s words fell like a knell upon her heart 



‘you do look bad  to be sure—i am sorry your head be so bad   lard 

lard  what a world this be   i’m that upset i don’t know whether i’m on

my head or my heels ’



the quaver in his voice smote rosalie   she must make an effort to

overcome her selfish grief  above all  to conquer that mad spirit of

rebellion which every now and then rose rampant within her   this good

man had need of her sympathy  should she not give it all the more

willingly that there was so large an element of remorse mingled with her

misery   she sat up and looked affectionately towards him 



‘i’m very  very sorry for you ’ she said 



‘’t was so sudden  ye see ’ pursued isaac dolefully   ‘he never so much

as said a word to i—never so much as hinted as he war n’t satisfied   i

mid ha’ seen that the restless fit were a comin’ on if i had n’t ha’ been

sich a sammy   restless   he were that restless last night  he were more

like a dog at a fair as had lost his master nor a reasonable human being 

it was up and down  and in and out the whole blessed evening   ah  i be

terrible upset  i be oncommon fond o’ richard  d’ ye see   always was

from the time he were a little ’un   i was oncommon fond o’ his mother

afore him  she were the only woman i ever could put up wi’—present

company excepted ’



as isaac ducked his head towards her with a melancholy attempt at

jocularity  rosalie’s heart sank lower still  she turned away hastily

that he might not see her face   at an earlier period she might have been

gratified by the knowledge that she was one of the few women in the world

whom isaac sharpe could ‘put up with’—phrases of the kind were his

nearest approach to ardour  and indicated  as she knew  a considerable

amount of solid attachment  but the passionate tones of richard’s voice

had rung too recently in her ear—the look in his eyes was too fresh in

her memory   ah  what had she not seen in those eyes 



‘’ees ’ went on her unconscious future husband  ‘’ees  i’ll be like to

miss ’en  him and me was the best of friends—and that’s not all   his

leaving me like this be terrible ill convenient just now—’t is the busy

time of year  d’ye see—haymaking time—every pair o’ hands is wanted 

richard did very near the work o’ two men  and he must go trapesing off

wi’ hisself  giving me no time at all to find somebody to take his

place ’



there was a distinct sense of injury in his tone now 



‘i am sure he never thought of that ’ cried rosalie  quickly and

resentfully   how could isaac find it in his heart to think of such

things in the face of the overwhelming fact that richard was gone 



‘ah  sure he did n’t ’ agreed isaac   ‘’t is a very bad job   a very bad

job indeed  but i suppose there bain’t nothing to be done ’



rosalie agreed with a sigh   it was too true  there was nothing to be

done 







chapter ix





    l’absence est à l’amour

    ce qu’est au feu le vent 

    il éteint le petit 

    mais it allume le grand 



several days passed  and richard made no sign   rosalie went about

looking like the ghost of herself   it was known that she was suffering

from a very severe attack of neuralgia  which  oddly enough  had first

seized her on the very day of richard marshall’s sudden departure 



some guileless people believed in the neuralgia—poor mrs  fiander did

look so very bad  and a body could n’t make believe to be so pale 

others  among whom was mrs  belbin  folded their arms and assumed a

knowing air   ’t was likely enough  averred this matron  for folks to

look pale as had reason to   mrs  fiander’s conscience was very likely

a troublin’ o’ she   she was a terrible one for carryin’ on wi’ young

men—a leadin’ of them on  and then a sendin’ them off wi’out no reason 

her sam could say somethin’ if he ’d a mind—her sam did know more than he

did like to talk about   others  again  were of opinion that mrs  fiander

was just wasting away for love of mr  sharpe’s nephew  and that that

young man had gone of his own accord  and had not been dismissed by the

widow   ’t was n’t very likely  said these sages  that richard marshall 

who had his own way to make in the world  and who was known to have great

expectations from his uncle  would wish to have any unpleasantness with

him   in response to the suggestion that the young man would n’t be

a doin’ so very bad for hisself if he and widow fiander made a match of

it  they returned conclusively that it was quite unpossible for him and

widow fiander to make a match of it  since her banns were to be given out

almost immediately with farmer sharpe   somebody had up and axed mrs 

fiander when the wedding was to be  and she had answered that the day was

not yet fixed  but that the wedding was to take place as agreed at the

end of july 



isaac heard none of these rumours  but he too wandered about with an

unusually lengthy and gloomy face 



one day  however  rosalie  looking out from the darkened room where she

was sitting  saw him hastening towards her house with every appearance of

excitement  waving a piece of paper in his hand 



in a moment she stood on the threshold   ‘you have heard from richard ’

she cried eagerly   ‘you have had a letter ’



‘nay  my dear  i have n’t had no letter ’ panted isaac  as soon as he was

near enough   ‘i ’ve had a graft ’



‘you have had what ’ inquired rosalie 



‘i have had a graft  my dear  a tele graft—in one of them nasty lookin’

yeller wrappers as al’ays seems to bring bad news ’



‘i hope it has n’t brought bad news this time ’ said she tremulously  as

they went into the house together 



‘nay  i hope not ’ said the farmer doubtfully   ‘it does n’t say much  d’

ye see—not much one way or t’ other ’



smoothing out the paper  he handed it to her upside down 



rosalie reversed it  and read the brief message 



‘send luggage as soon as possible lime street station  liverpool  to be

called for —richard ’



‘liverpool   then he must intend to go to america again ’



isaac flushed  and his jaw dropped 



‘now  mrs  f   i do call that a jumpin’ to conclusions ’ he said

presently  quite testily for him   ‘you have n’t no earthly reason for

sayin’ sich a thing   is it likely my nevvy ’ud go off to ’merica again

when he’s only just a comed back   did n’t he say he was a longin’ and

a longin’ to be back to the old country—’



‘i know ’ interrupted rosalie quickly  ‘but for all that i’m sure he

means to return to america now   he told me he landed at liverpool  and 

depend upon it  he intends to start from there again   yes  yes  i’m

quite sure of it   he did not rest  you see  until he had put the length

of the country between us  and now he means to go further still—perhaps

when he is at the other side of the world he will be contented ’



she spoke with irrepressible bitterness  but isaac did not notice it 



‘if that’s your opinion  mrs  f  ’ he said  ‘we ’d best lose no time in

carryin’ out my little plan   i ’ve got a plan  d’ ye see ’ he added 

with modest triumph   ‘ah  it comed to me all of a sudden   we’ll write

to him  mrs  f ’



‘but what would be the use of writing ’ said rosalie   ‘we cannot force

him to come back against his will ’



‘nay  we can’t force him  but i think ’t is only some notion the chap’s

got in his head   he seemed quite settled till last week  and maybe the

rovin’ fit will ha’ wore off a bit by now   he’s gone all the way to

liverpool  d’ ye see—that ought to ha’ let off a bit o’ steam   maybe  if

we wrote him a letter and just axed him straight out  he might change his

mind   we can send a letter with his luggage—’t won’t be too late so long

as he has n’t left the country  and he can’t leave the country wi’out his

luggage  d’ ye see   we can but try ’



‘of course—you can try ’ said rosalie  pressing her hand to her head with

a bewildered air 



‘so  i were thinkin’  mrs  f   if ye ’d jist set down and drop a line to

’en for me—that’s to say  if your head bain’t a troublin’ you too much—’



he was looking at her pleadingly  misunderstanding the expression of her

face 



‘oh  never mind about my head   i’m only wondering—i’m only thinking 

must the letter go to day ’



‘well ye see  richard did ax most perticlar for his traps to be sent off

at once ’ replied the farmer  his eyes round with anxiety  ‘and if we

don’t send the letter at the same time we mid miss him ’



‘bithey used always to write to him for you  didn’t she ’ said rosalie 

catching at the last straw   ‘perhaps it would have more effect if she

wrote ’



‘nay now  my dear  if ye ’d be so obligin’  i ’d take it very kind o’ you

to do it   it d’ take bithey very near three days to write a letter—i ’d

be very much obliged to ’ee  my dear ’ he repeated persuasively 



thus adjured she had no resource but to comply  and with a beating heart

and throbbing brain she set about her preparations   going to the window 

she drew up the blind a little way  and then  collecting pen  ink  and

paper  sat down opposite isaac at the table   when she had thus

inaugurated proceedings isaac might have been observed to gather himself

up  concentrating  as it were  all his forces in preparation to the

effort of composition 



having dipped her pen in the ink  rosalie looked inquiringly at him 



‘how do you wish me to begin ’ she said 



‘bithey do al’ays start off wi’ “my dear nevvy ”’ responded isaac in a

husky tone  as though he were speaking from beneath a blanket  which

evidently resulted from the mighty constraint he was putting upon

himself 



‘ my dear nephew  ’ wrote rosalie  and then she raised her eyes again 



the farmer cleared his throat  drew a long breath  and continued slowly 

and with apparently immense difficulty 



‘ your uncle isaac do say —’



‘say ’ repeated rosalie  when she had written the last word 



isaac  crimson in the face  was absorbed in the mental struggle  but

presently perceived with a start that her pen had stopped moving 



‘have ’ee got  say    well   your uncle isaac do say — as i hope you’ll

change your mind —’



‘had n’t i better put  he  hopes ’ said the secretary 



the farmer came out of his brown study  and looked up at her inquiringly 



‘who’s he ’



‘why you  of course   if i say  “your uncle isaac ” i ought to go on in

the same way  “he says ”  if i say “i” it will look as if i were speaking

of myself—as if it were  i  who wished he would change his mind ’



‘well  and don’t ’ee wish it ’ asked isaac sharply  but reproachfully

too 



rosalie bent her head over the paper  and answered hurriedly 



‘i   oh  of course  of course  but it would not do for me to tell him

so—it would be too much of a liberty ’



‘lard  no  my dear   richard would n’t think it such   but there  i be

dathered with so much talk—you must n’t cut in again  mrs  f —’t is

terrible hard work writin’ letters  and if ye go for to speak to i in the

middle i’ll be all mixed up   let me tell ’ee my own way  d’ ye

see —richard knows my ways  and he’ll understand fast enough   now  let

me see —“ your uncle isaac wishes for to say as i hope ye’ll change your

mind and come back     mrs  f  is a writin’ this for i    and she wishes

for to say ’t is uncle isaac as wants ’ee back ”—that’ll make it all

right  d’ ye see ’ he continued  dropping the high unnatural tone which

seemed essential to dictation  and adopting a confidential one—‘now he

can’t go for to make no mistakes   have ’ee wrote that ’



‘no —oh  don’t make me write that  mr  sharpe—i don’t want him to think

me unkind ’



isaac clicked his tongue in desperation 



‘lard ha’ mercy ’ he ejaculated  ‘this here letter ’ull never get wrote 

now  my dear  jist put down what i d’ tell ’ee—and don’t flurry me   when

i do get flurried i can’t for the life o’ me think o’ nothin’   jist be

a puttin’ o’ that down  and i’ll go on thinkin’  d’ ye see   it’ll come

right—ye’ll find it’ll come right ’



rosalie reluctantly set down the required sentence  and found at its

conclusion that isaac had already inflated himself in preparation for a

further effort 



‘ mrs  f  d’ wish ’ee to come back too    as is nat’ral    but she thinks

it more becomin’ not to say so  ’



he fixed his eyes sternly upon her as he enunciated this statement  and

in sheer desperation rosalie set it down 



‘now ye have n’t nothing to complain of  i don’t think ’ he remarked

triumphantly   ‘now we can get on   well—what next ’



after deep reflection the following words came forth 



‘’ t is most onconvenient for ’ee to be a leavin’ me at such short

notice  

 i — wish — ’ee — most — pertic’lar — to — come — back — to week     we

be a goin’ to cut the church meadow    and   every hand be wanted     i

do feel a bit hurt in my feelin’s ’—here isaac paused to brush his coat

sleeve across his eyes  and continued brokenly—‘ hurt in my feelin’s to

think as you have a left your old uncle like that    ’t war n’t well done

o’ him ’ he muttered  parenthetically  ‘nay  i can’t say as it were well

done o’ richard ’



he wiped his eyes again  sniffed  drew an immense breath  and started off

afresh 



‘ like that     i do think ye mid ha’ said a word    but i will not find

fault no more    but jist ax ye to come straight back — an’ all will be

forgive and forgot    now i think  mrs  f   we mid finish  ye mid jist

write my name and i’ll put my mark to it ’



he heaved a deep sigh of relief  wiped his brow  and sat gazing at her as

she appended his signature to the page 



‘that be my name  be it ’ he inquired   ‘it do look very pretty wrote out

so nice and small   ’ees  i can see as this here’s my name 

 i — s — a —   you put  a  twice  mrs  f ’



‘yes  it should be written twice ’



‘ah ’ said the farmer  gazing at the page doubtfully   ‘bithey now do

only put it once—it be a matter o’ taste  i suppose   well  now  i’ll put

my mark ’



he ground his pen slowly into the paper  horizontally and

perpendicularly  and remained gazing at it with a certain modest pride 



‘there  shut ’en up now  and write his name outside ’



rosalie obeyed  and held out the document towards isaac  but as he was

about to take it she drew it back  a deep flush overspreading her face 

after a moment’s hesitation  however  she again tendered it to him 



‘there—take it ’ she said  with a note of sharpness in her voice which

would have struck a more acute observer than isaac  but he duly pocketed

it without noticing that anything was amiss 



left to herself she sat for a moment or two in deep thought  her chin

propped upon her hands  then suddenly rising  rushed out into the yard 



‘mr  sharpe ’ she called   ‘isaac ’



but the farmer’s broad back was already vanishing down the lane 

evidently her voice failed to reach him as he did not turn his head 

rosalie stood looking after him  without making further attempts to

attract his attention  and then slowly returned to the house   why should

she call him back  after all—what need was there for her thus to disturb

herself   could she help writing the letter exactly as he wished  and how

foolish were the qualms of conscience which the remembrance of certain

phrases in it evoked   it was his letter  not hers  it was he who had

insisted on stating that she wished richard to return—she had never

authorised him to do so   if richard did come back she could not be

blamed for it   if he did come back 



again supporting her throbbing head with her hands  she tried to reason

with herself  but the turmoil in heart and brain for a time forbade any

consecutive train of ideas   during the long blank days which had passed

since richard’s departure  and often in the course of the weary  restless

nights  this thought had constantly recurred to her with a never failing

stab — he has gone — he will never come back  



and now  if he did come back—if he came back even for a little while   if

she might just see him again  if it were only to be once or twice   at

the mere suggestion she was conscious of a lifting of the load which had

been crushing her   if he were made to know  through no fault of hers but

rather against her will  that she did wish him to return—she who had let

him go forth without a word to stay him—if he even guessed that she

longed to see him—oh  it would be sweet to think he knew  that he would

henceforth judge her less harshly  that he would realise how hard had

been her struggle 



she raised her head  her lips parted in a smile  her eyes dreamily gazing

at the strip of sunlit green outside her window   there he had stood 

thence he had turned away so mournfully  and now he was to come back 

 to come back    would he not read between the lines of the oddly

composed missive—would not the very words have for him a deeper meaning

than their guileless originator guessed at—would he not come flying to

her side   in a few days—in little more than a few hours  perhaps  he

would be with her  and then 



she gave a sudden gasp  and flung herself forward across the table   and

then   in a moment the web of self deception with which she had been

endeavouring to cloak the situation was torn to shreds  and she saw the

truth   a crisis was impending  it was folly to pretend that it would

take her unawares  it was worse than folly to endeavour to shift the

responsibility to poor unsuspicious isaac   if richard returned the

struggle would have to be gone through again  it would be even harder

than before  for she would have lured him back after he had broken from

her   if thus sorely tempted and wrongfully encouraged he were to speak

those words which she had seen so often trembling on his lips  what

answer could she make   could she look him in the face and affect

unconsciousness  or—what did she mean to do   did she mean to keep her

plighted troth as an honest woman should  or did she mean to cast aside 

for good and all  truth  and honour  and self respect  and jilt the man

who had been her faithful friend 



‘i want to do right ’ said rosalie  with another gasping sigh   ‘i have

never told a lie in my life  i won’t tell one now  i won’t act one

either   if he comes back it will only be on false pretences  he must n’t

be allowed to come back ’



she lay still for a moment  her arms extended  a kind of tremor passing

every now and then over her frame   presently she said again  half aloud 



‘i won’t be deceitful  i won’t break my word  but oh  how hard it is to

do right   god help me ’



she straightened herself all at once  and pushed back the hair from her

forehead  then  drawing the blotter towards her  wrote a hasty line on a

sheet of paper—‘do not come back  i implore you   r  f ’—thrust it into

an envelope  and directed it to richard   with little convulsive sobs at

intervals she went upstairs  bathed her swollen eyes  and put on her hat 



there was no one about the down farm when she approached it  but  on

entering  she almost fell over a strapped portmanteau that had been

placed just inside the doorway   as she recovered herself bithey appeared

at the kitchen door 



‘i thought you was the carrier ’ she remarked   ‘master did say as he ’d

sent for him to fetch that there box o’ richard marshall’s   ’t is to go

to liverpool to day ’



‘is mr  sharpe in ’ asked rosalie falteringly   somehow the sight of that

portmanteau made her turn suddenly faint 



‘nay  he bain’t   but i’m expectin’ him back every minute   he be gone

some time now  and he said he ’d just catch the carrier   i had a hard

job to get all packed and ready  but ’t is done now ’



it was all packed  the straps fastened  the lock made secure   rosalie

was too late after all  the important postscript which was to supplement

the letter could not  as she intended  be slipped among richard’s

effects   her heart gave a sudden throb that was not altogether of pain 

she had honestly tried  but fate willed otherwise 



‘i don’t think i’ll wait ’ she stammered  scarcely knowing what she said 

‘i shall see mr  sharpe to morrow  and i should only be in your way   i

dare say you are busy ’



‘nay  not that busy now  ma’am   i’m just a makin’ a parcel of a big

thick coat o’ richard’s   ’t would n’t go in the box nohow  and i’m

tryin’ to pack it in paper  but ’t is that heavy it do slip out at one

side so soon as i get t’ other wrapped up ’



‘let me help you ’ said rosalie   ‘four hands are better than two ’



she had never seen richard wear this coat  yet the mere sight of it—the

mere consciousness that it was his caused a recurrence of that strange

wave of faintness 



‘we want a little bit more string  bithey ’ she said with the quaver in

her voice which had been noticeable before 



‘i think there’s a little bit on the dresser shelf ’ returned the old

woman  and  dropping her end of the parcel  she went across the kitchen 



this was rosalie’s chance   she was white to the very lips  but she did

not flinch   with cold  trembling fingers  she hid away the note in the

breast pocket of the coat  he would be sure to find it there 



bithey discovered nothing  and presently  the packet being secured 

rosalie betook herself homewards 



‘i ’ve done it ’ she said  pausing when she reached the solitude of the

downs   ‘thank god   i ’ve done it   it will be all right now ’



but it was not surprising that in the midst of her self congratulations

on having so successfully barred herself out of eden she should once more

melt into tears 







chapter x





    had we never loved sae kindly 

    had we never loved sae blindly 

    never met  or never parted 

    we had ne’er been broken hearted 



                                                                    burns 



the cutting and making of rosalie’s hay had been proceeding briskly in

the church meadow  the last swathes had fallen  and every available pair

of hands had been called upon to assist in the work  for experienced

weather prophets had foretold gloomily that the actual ‘fine spell’ could

not be expected to last 



towards evening on the second day farmer sharpe stood alone in the centre

of the field  mopped  for the hundredth time  his perspiring brow  and

cast a contemplative look round 



’t was past seven o’clock  the men had gone home some time before  but he

had remained to take a final survey of the scene of their labours 



‘i don’t think it’s so very like to rain ’ remarked isaac  looking up at

the sky  where  indeed  no trace of a cloud was to be seen   ‘nay  i

don’t hold wi’ job—’t will keep up for a bit yet   mrs  f  ’ull ha’ gone

home by now  i should think—she’d begin to find it a bit damp in the

dell   the dew be falling very fast   well  i’ll go home to my supper ’



he passed through the gate at the further end of the field  and had

traversed more than half the distance which separated him from his home

when the sound of heavy but rapid steps behind him made him halt and turn

round 



job hunt  who had evidently been hastening in pursuit of him  paused too 

his great red face wearing an appearance of unusual excitement  and his

sly blue eyes positively goggling in his head   owing to the unusual

press of work  and the need for accomplishing it in a given time  isaac

had persuaded rosalie to consent to his engaging this unwelcome addition

to her forces  and she had agreed with a meekness that sufficiently

indicated her spiritless condition   job it was who had been most

energetic in foretelling a coming storm  partly in order to render his

services the more valuable  and partly because of a natural pleasure in

predicting disaster to mrs  fiander’s crops 



‘well ’ said isaac  gazing at him in astonishment 



‘have ’ee seen what be goin’ on yonder  sir ’ was job’s counter query 



‘what be a goin’ on where ’ inquired the farmer 



‘why  there ’ returned hunt  with a significant jerk of the thumb in the

direction of the church meadow 



‘there bain’t nothin’ at all a goin’ on there ’ returned his employer

sternly   ‘i be just come from there—the field’s empty ’



‘nay  mr  sharpe ’ returned job  half closing one eye  and assuming a

very knowing look   ‘nay  it bain’t empty   jist you step back and see 

if you was to step up to the dell very cautious—i’d advise ’ee to go very

cautious  sir—you ’d maybe see summat as ’ud surprise ’ee   jist you come

along wi’ i  mr  sharpe—i’ll show ’ee where to look  and i d’ ’low ye’ll

be astonished ’



isaac surveyed him for half a minute or so without speaking  and then

slowly jerked his thumb forwards 



‘cut away ’ he said briefly   ‘’ees  i don’t mind if i do come  but i

don’t expect to see nothin’ surprisin’ at all ’



job grinned derisively for all rejoinder  and led the way as requested 

walking with exaggerated caution  and turning his malevolent red bearded

face over his shoulder every now and then to make sure that isaac was

following   the latter shambled along at his usual pace and with a

perfectly imperturbable face 



as they drew near the dell  a small cup shaped pit surrounded by bushes

at the upper end of the field  the sound of voices was distinctly

audible—two voices  a man’s and a woman’s—speaking  however  so low that

even when isaac and his companion were close to the brink they could

distinguish no words 



‘jist step for’ard  mr  sharpe  sir ’ whispered job excitedly   ‘jist

look down through the bushes  i’ll bide here till ye come back ’



sharpe paused for a moment or two  staring at him with evident

displeasure  and then went forward   presently his tall form towered

above the bushes  and he looked down into the pit beneath 



after a long and steady gaze he returned to job  took him by the

shoulder  and propelled him to a safe distance from the tantalising spot 

job  when finally released  examined him with great curiosity  but the

farmer’s face  though a little redder than usual  in consequence probably

of his recent exertions  was stolid as ever 



‘well ’ he said in answer to the man’s inquiring gaze 



‘well  sir  did ’ee see who was there ’



‘of course i did   mrs  fiander was there  where i left her  and my nevvy

was there   he ’ve comed home  i see  as i axed him ’



‘oh ’ said job  much disappointed  ‘i didn’t know you were expectin’ of

him ’



‘did n’t ’ee  job   i ’ve been expectin’ of ’en all this week   i’m glad

he’s come ’



‘it seems a bit queer as he should be in mrs  fiander’s hayfield  instead

o’ goin’ straight to your place ’ urged job almost plaintively   it was a

little disappointing to find that his great discovery had been

anticipated   ‘when i did see ’en b i  c y cling along the road i made

sure he must be going straight to you  and then when i did see his

b i  c y cle leanin’ agen’ the hedge  i jist thought i ’d see where he ’d

got to—and there he were in the dell ’



‘and a very nat’ral place for ’en to be ’ returned isaac in his most

matter of fact tone   ‘i did tell ’en most pertic lar we was cuttin’ the

church meadow  and when he saw mrs  fiander in the dell ’t was most

nat’ral he should go and speak to her   i don’t see nothin’ queer  job

hunt ’



‘he was a holdin’ o’ both her hands when i see ’en ’ muttered job 



‘ah ’ commented isaac   ‘well  he’ll be a holdin’ both mine soon   i be

main glad he be come back   now i’m a goin’ home to my supper  and i

think you ’d do well to go back to yours  job   i’ll expect you early in

the field to morrow  so the sooner ye get back to look arter your own

business the better   i would n’t advise ’ee to go interfering wi’ my

nevvy   he bain’t so very fond o’ folks axin’ questions or pryin’ about 

ah  i ’ve known ’en take his fists to a man once as he thought too

curious   ’t is the way wi’ young chaps ’



he nodded  fixed his eyes impressively on hunt  as though to make sure

that the meaning of his words had penetrated to that somewhat dull witted

gentleman’s consciousness  and finally rolled homewards  to all

appearance placid as ever 



he had not proceeded very far before he paused  however  shook his head 

and finally stood stock still 



‘two hands ’ said farmer sharpe reflectively   ‘two hands ’



                                           



it now becomes necessary to ascertain what passed before isaac sharpe 

looking down through the willow bushes  descried richard marshall in such

close proximity to mrs  fiander 



nothing certainly was farther from rosalie’s thoughts when she had taken

refuge in that sheltered spot from the glare of the afternoon sun than

the expectation of the advent of this companion   she had  in fact  quite

decided that he was by this time out of the country  and had  indeed 

made up her mind to erase his image definitely from her memory 

henceforward  as she frequently told herself  she must think only of

isaac—isaac  who had always been her friend  who was so soon to be her

husband   her husband —she must face the thought though she unconsciously

shrank from it   oh  would—would that this sweet cup of forbidden love

had never been held to her lips   she had dashed it from her  but the

taste of it remained and had taken all the savour out of her life   it

had been to her a poisonous cup  containing as it did wine from the fruit

of the tree of knowledge   ‘ you know very little of life  ’ richard had

said to her once   alas  alas  she knew now more than enough 



‘oh  elias—poor elias ’ she groaned to herself sometimes  ‘why did you

die   if you had lived i should have known nothing—i should have guessed

at nothing   i might have gone down to my grave without knowing that

there was any other love besides that which i gave you ’



as an antidote to the rebellious longing of which she was too often

conscious  rosalie had recourse to the panacea she had hitherto found

unfailing in times of affliction  hard work   since the writing of that

letter to richard  and the subsequent battle with herself  she had

resumed her old energetic habits   once more she rose with the dawn  once

more she passed hours in toil no less arduous than that allotted to her

servants   she avoided solitude as much as possible  and strove by every

means in her power to tire herself out 



so tired was she  indeed  on this particular afternoon  that  having

sought the friendly shade of the grassy nook already referred to  she

acknowledged herself to be incapable of further effort   even when the

great heat had somewhat abated  and the retreating voices and heavy tread

of her labourers as they trooped homewards warned her that it was growing

late  she sat on  her hands clasping her knees  her eyes gazing vacantly

on the ground  too weary even to think 



a footstep sounded in the neighbourhood of her retreat  but she did not

raise her eyes  it was some straggler  probably  hastening to rejoin the

others   she could hear the bushes rustling  as though brushed by a

passing form  and kept very still  she wanted nobody to speak to her 

nobody even to look at her   but now the step faltered  halted—there was

a pause  and then rapid feet began to descend towards where she sat   she

raised her eyes  first in surprise and a little irritation  then in

incredulous wonder  then—oh  what was it that richard saw in them 



in a moment he was bending over her and both her hands were clasped in

his 



was it that particular moment that job hunt chose to pursue his

investigations  or did the acknowledged lovers remain thus longer than

they knew   rosalie could never afterwards tell  nor could richard   they

felt as if they were in a dream  time  place  circumstances  were alike

forgotten  a vague undefined bliss—the intangible bliss of dreams—haunted

them both  and in the minds of both lurked the same dread of awakening 



it was rosalie who was first recalled to life   her eyes  which had been

fixed on richard’s face  dropped gradually to his hands  gazed idly 

first at those hands  then at her own which he was holding  then the idea

gradually took shape in her mind—those were her hands  rosalie fiander’s

hands  that were lying in richard’s clasp  and they had no right to be

there 



she snatched them away instantly  and the charm was broken 



‘you have come back ’ she cried   ‘why did you come back ’



‘i came ’ said he  ‘because i received your letter ’



her face was white with anguish  his  on the contrary  flushed  eager 

triumphant 



‘but did you not find the note which i put in your pocket ’ she murmured 

gazing at him with frightened eyes   ‘i thought you would be sure to find

it   the other was not—was not really mine   i had to write what he

wanted ’



‘i know ’ he answered blithely   ‘i could see it plainly enough   it was

not that which brought me home   it was your own precious little note—the

little line which laid bare your heart to me   i had already sailed

before i found it  but we touched at queenstown and i landed there and

took the first boat home   i have travelled night and day since ’



she was shaking like a reed in the wind   ‘but—i begged you not to come ’

she whispered 



‘you begged me not to come  sweet  and so i guessed  i knew—you betrayed

your secret  my dear love  and i felt my own power ’



‘no  no ’ she gasped  ‘you must not speak to me like this  richard—i will

not listen   you know quite well that i cannot listen   i belong to

another man ’



but richard bent nearer still  his face alight with the same inexplicable

triumph—a triumph that was almost fierce 



‘you belong to me ’ he said  and his words were perhaps the more

passionate because spoken so low   ‘you have belonged to me from the

first   even from the moment when i saw you in the picture i said to

myself—’



‘oh  no ’ pleaded rosalie  in tones as passionate as his  but infinitely

piteous   ‘do not say it  richard—do not—do not put it into words ’



her hand flew out involuntarily as though to stop his mouth  he caught it

and kissed it though it fluttered in his grasp 



‘why should i not say it—why should i not be brave enough to put into

words the thought which has been in both our minds so often   when i saw

your picture i fancied myself standing beside you  bending over you—’



‘oh  hush  hush ’



she had withdrawn her hand  and was covering her face 



‘i said to myself ’ he persevered  his words coming brokenly because of

his quick breathing   ‘i said to myself  “if that woman lives she shall

be my wife—i will search for her until i find her ”  and then when i

found you—i thought you were free ’



‘but i was not free ’ she interrupted  dropping her hands and looking up

with eyes fierce and wild like those of a hunted animal   ‘i am not free

now  neither are you free   you are bound to him as much as i am—your

duty stares you in the face—’



‘it is too late to talk of duty   i ought never to have seen you   do you

suppose there is anything which you can tell me that i have not told

myself a hundred times   he is my uncle—yes   he has been my benefactor

always—more than a father to me—yes  yes   he is the kindest  the most

warm hearted  the most guileless of men   it would never enter his

honest  innocent mind to suspect me of trying to supplant him  in acting

as i do i am a traitor  a liar—vile  ungrateful  dishonourable 

dishonest—oh  there are no words strong enough  or black enough to paint

me as i am   i know it and i agree to it  but i love you  rosalie  and i

will not give you up ’



some of his words were scarcely audible as they came in gusts from his

quivering lips  the veins on his forehead stood out  there was no

mistaking the bitter contempt with which he stigmatised his own conduct 

but there was even less possibility of misapprehending his deadly

earnestness of purpose 



‘i mean to have you ’ he went on  ‘i mean to let everything go—except

you ’



she was so much taken aback at the suddenness of the onslaught  so

confounded at the quickness with which he had forestalled all she had

intended to urge  that she stood before him for a moment absolutely mute 

trembling  moreover  with the growing consciousness of her own weakness 

and at his confident assumption of mastery over her 



meanwhile he  with his eyes fixed upon her face  read it like a book 

his own suddenly changed 



‘it is useless to struggle  love ’ he said  speaking very gently and

tenderly   ‘we have both done our best—we have tried to do right  but

fate has been too strong for us   we must just make up our minds to let

ourselves go with the tide—and be happy ’



rosalie was  as has been seen  very impressionable  very emotional—in a

word  very womanly  but for all that there was at her heart’s core the

little kernel of strength which is to be found in the hearts of most good

women—an instinctive sense of rectitude  the love of duty for duty’s

sake  even when the accomplishment of it involves great sacrifice   she

looked richard full in the face now 



‘no ’ she said  ‘i will not take any happiness that has to be bought by

doing wrong   i made my own choice and fixed my lot in life before i knew

you  and now i will abide by it ’



the very severity of the struggle gave her courage  and richard  all

passion swayed as he was  had in him a certain element of chivalrousness

that responded to the effort she was making 



he was silent  and rosalie  quick to perceive her advantage  went on

eagerly 



‘i ask you to leave me  richard  i want you to go now   it is quite true

that you have a kind of power over me  and that if you’—her voice

faltered for a moment  but she steadied it—‘if you go on urging me and

persuading me you will very likely make me give in in the end  but i ask

you   because  you love me  not to do this   we could not be really happy

if—if we came together through being dishonourable and ungrateful   it is

better to do right at all costs   as for me  i mean to keep my word to

your uncle   i will try my best to make him a good wife and to forget

you ’



‘and have you thought ’ returned he  with a bitterness which he could not

control—‘have you thought at all of what is to become of me   the whole

thing is absurd ’ he went on with increasing irritation   ‘do you think

for a moment that my uncle could suffer a tithe of what i shall suffer 

you know very well he is not capable of it   besides—’  he broke off 



‘i know what you mean ’ said rosalie  colouring faintly   ‘he would not

have thought of marrying me if i had not first suggested it   but i did

suggest it  and he is very fond of me now ’



‘fond ’ echoed the young man scornfully 



‘yes  as fond as it is in his nature to be   he has been faithful to me 

and i will be faithful to him   i will do nothing that could pain or

humiliate him   some day you too will feel glad that you have not injured

your benefactor ’



‘then what do you want me to do ’ said richard  still half sullenly 

though she saw by his face that her words had struck home 



‘i want you to go away now—go quite away as you intended—as fast as you

can—before—before anything happens to make us change our minds ’



in the words  in her pleading eyes there was that same piteous confession

of weakness which had before touched richard  and which now roused afresh

his most generous instincts 



‘i will do what you wish ’ he said   ‘you are a good woman  rosalie 

i—will go ’



‘to night ’



‘yes  now ’



she glanced at him quickly  opened her mouth as if to speak  and then

turned away without carrying out her intention 



thus they parted  without another word or a clasp of the hands   richard

climbed up the bank and disappeared from view  and rosalie remained

standing where he had left her 







chapter xi





           picture  music score from hayden’s surprise symphony 



when richard emerged from the shadowy hollow where he had left his

mistress standing as if turned to stone  he found all the land about him

bathed with the rosy glow of sunset   the long ‘rollers’ of newly cut

grass over which he stepped were touched here and there by arrows of

light  and the twigs of the hedge towards which he made his way were

outlined as by fire 



he saw none of these things  however  but when  climbing the low bank and

passing through a gap in the hedge  he descended into the road  he was

suddenly recalled to actualities by the unexpected appearance of a

colossal figure which seemed to be mounting guard over his bicycle 



as richard started back farmer sharpe rose from his seat on the bank  and

stood square and determined before him  the ruddy light playing upon his

rugged face and shaggy hair and glorifying his white smock   one great

hand still rested on the saddle of the bicycle  which it almost entirely

covered   as richard remained dumbly gazing at him  his fingers began to

drum an impatient tune on its smooth surface 



the young man gazed desperately first at him and then at the bicycle 

filled with an insane desire to possess himself of it and ride away at

full speed   but whether because his courage failed him  or because

nobler and more manly feelings gained the ascendency over this momentary

cowardice  he did not put the design into execution 



after gazing steadily at his nephew for what seemed an interminable time 

isaac removed his hand from the bicycle and pointed in the direction of

the little dell 



‘i seed ’ee there  richard ’ he remarked in a sepulchral tone   ‘i seed

’ee there with mrs  f ’



richard braced himself  and looked him full in the face  but made no

rejoinder 



‘’ees ’ said the farmer  ‘i seed ye both  and i’ve been a waiting here

for ye  richard ’



still silence   richard  indeed  felt that it would be useless to enter

upon either explanation or apology 



mr  sharpe’s hand crept back to the saddle and resumed its impatient

tune  he planted his legs a little more widely apart  continuing the

while to stare unwinkingly in his nephew’s face 



when the tension had become almost unbearable  he spoke again 



‘i thought i ’d wait for ’ee here ’ he said   ‘i thought ye ’d very

likely have summat to say to me ’



the young man bit his lip and clenched his hands  he could scarcely brook

the expectant look in those eyes 



‘what am i to say  uncle isaac   i—what can i say   i’m going away at

once ’



the combined effect of sunshine and emotion had already intensified the

farmer’s usually healthy colour  but this announcement caused it to

deepen to a positively alarming extent   for a moment he seemed in danger

of suffocation  he raised his hand mechanically to the loose collar of

his smock and clutched at it  his eyes seemed ready to start from their

sockets  and  though he opened his mouth and rolled his head from side to

side as though about to fulminate against his nephew  no words came 



‘don’t ’ cried richard  much alarmed—‘don’t be so angry  uncle—you really

need n’t be so much upset   i tell you i’m going away at once—to night ’



farmer sharpe sank down on the bank  sliding his legs out before him

rigid as a pair of compasses  his head continued to roll threateningly 

and his eyes to gaze fiercely at richard  but it was some time before he

could find voice 



‘ye can’t go to night ’ he said at last  in husky  suffocating tones 

‘there bain’t no train to night ’



‘not from branston  i know  but i mean to ride to wimborne  and catch the

night train there ’



somehow this catching of the night train at wimborne seemed to be the

culminating point of richard’s depravity   isaac positively groaned

aloud  the fierceness went out of his eyes  and to richard’s infinite

distress they filled with tears 



‘what more can i do ’ he faltered  torn with remorse and grief as he bent

over him 



‘i did n’t think it of ’ee  richard—nay  if anybody had told me ye ’d go

for to do such a thing i would n’t ha’ believed ’em   to go off wi’out a

word to i—me as has been a father to ’ee—nay  not so much as a word ’



he paused  choked with emotion  and fell to wiping his eyes and shaking

his head disconsolately  while richard  slowly straightening himself 

stood looking down at him 



‘when job hunt did call me  and did p’int out as you was standin’—you and

mrs  f —hand in hand  both hands in both hands ’ he added  correcting

himself  ‘i didn’t let on to take no notice   i did send job about his

business  and i did say to myself  “i’ll wait ” says i   “my nevvy ’ull

tell me all about it jist now ”  and i did go and sit me down here   says

i  “i’ll not interfere  i’ll wait ” i says  “richard will out wi’ it all

to i—he’ll act straight ” i says   “he’ll tell me ”’



he spoke almost appealingly   richard’s face  which had turned from white

to red  was now white again 



‘i wanted to spare you  uncle ’ he murmured at last  falteringly 



isaac groaned  and shook his head  then drawing a long breath  and

peering anxiously at his nephew  he whispered pleadingly 



‘what was you a sayin’ to mrs  f  when you was a holdin’ of her hands 

richard ’



‘oh ’ groaned the other impatiently  ‘there are some things that can’t be

talked about   i should n’t have held her hands—i scarcely knew that i

was holding them   what does it matter now   we have said good bye to

each other for ever  we have made up our minds never to see each other

again ’



isaac’s jaw dropped  he brought down his fist heavily on the bank beside

him 



‘well ’ he muttered under his breath  ‘i’m danged   i can’t get no

satisfaction   not a word ’



‘you know enough ’ said richard fiercely   ‘be content with what i tell

you—i will never darken your doors again ’



isaac brought down his fist once more on the bank  and then slowly

hoisted himself on to his feet 



‘if ye have n’t naught to say to i  i’ve summat to say to you ’ he

announced  speaking very slowly   ‘i bain’t a goin’ to let ’ee go off

like that   ’t is my way to be straightfor’ard   i’ll speak my mind plain

to ’ee this night  and i’ll speak my mind to mrs  f   where be mrs  f  

come along of i  richard  and find her ’



he had squeezed through the gap in the hedge while still speaking  and

richard had no choice but to follow him   a few strides brought them to

the dell  and  looking down  they descried rosalie standing in the same

attitude as that in which richard had left her 



‘mrs  fiander ’ called isaac  bending over the brink  ‘will ’ee oblige me

by stepping up here   the sides be a bit steep  and i bain’t so young as

i were—i can’t very well go down  but i ’d be obliged if you ’d step up 

i ’ve summat to say to you and my nevvy here ’



rosalie had started violently at the sound of his voice  and now obeyed

his summons in silence  but she trembled so much  and the wet grass had

become so slippery  that she stumbled often  and it was some time before

she completed the ascent   meanwhile both men stood watching her 

motionless  and in silence   once or twice she had raised her eyes

towards the great white figure which awaited her on the brink  and it

seemed to her that isaac’s face was grave and stern like the face of a

judge   she did not dare once glance at richard  but she felt  even

without looking at him  that their secret was discovered 



the farmer backed a little away from the edge of the dell when rosalie

came forth  and stood looking from one to the other  then he spoke very

solemnly  and with some hesitation 



‘mrs  fiander  as i was a sayin’ to richard jist now  ’t is best to be

straightfor’ard—’ees  ’t is best to speak out  even when it be hard to

speak out   i can’t get no satisfaction from richard—he did acshally tell

i to my face as he had made up his mind to go straight off wi’out a

single word to i   he comes wi’out a word and he goes wi’out a word 

now  mrs  f   i did see you together jist now  and i did think as you ’d

have summat to tell me ’



there was a long pause   isaac looked once more from rosalie’s graceful 

shrinking figure to the other culprit  who stood with bent head  awaiting

the storm of reproach and vituperation 



‘from the very first ’ pursued isaac  still in that solemn and somewhat

stern tone  ‘i did tell ’ee my mind plain  mrs  fiander   i did tell ’ee

straight out  did n’t i  as i had n’t never fixed my thoughts on

materimony   ’t was you as was set on it—’



‘oh  i know ’ interrupted rosalie   ‘i know it too well   do not throw it

in my face now ’



‘throw it in your face  mrs  f    who’s a throwing o’ what in your face 

all i do say is i did al’ays do my best for ’ee—don’t you go for to blame

me  for blame i do not deserve ’



both raised their heads and looked at him  astonished at the change of

tone  for now the old man seemed to speak more in sorrow than in anger 



‘i did al’ays do my best for ’ee   i did al’ays think and act as kind as

i could  and you did never once think of i   ’ees  i did never

interfere ’ he went on  more emphatically  ‘i left ye both to

yourselves—did n’t i   i never comed in your way   but ye mid ha’ given

me a thought ’



the penitent heads drooped again   what need had they to be reminded how

guileless he had been  how unsuspicious  how chivalrous in thought and

deed 



‘’ees ’ went on isaac  ‘i did leave ye to yourselves—i did ax ye to make

friends   do you mind how often i axed ye to be friends ’



true indeed  only too true   they had taken a base advantage of his

confidence  they had profited of the opportunities he had given them only

to be more and more unfaithful to him in their hearts 



‘i thought you ’d be different to what you do be ’ he continued  with

increasing severity   ‘when sam’el cross did tell i as you ’d snap up

mrs  f   richard  what did i say   says i  “my nevvy bain’t a snapper ”

d’ ye mind   i said the same thing to you   well  i thought maybe you ’d

say summat then—but not a word ’



‘uncle  i—it is n’t fair to reproach me like this   i kept away from

littlecomb as long as i could  you know that ’



‘’ees  i do know it  richard—i know it very well  you would n’t come with

me when i did ax ’ee that sunday   you would n’t come along o’ me to

littlecomb  nay  but you went out by yourself that night  and when you

comed back ye would n’t so much as sit down and smoke a pipe like an

honest christian  and next day you must get up and go off wi’ yourself

before ’t were light   and what did i do then—what did i do  richard 

though you ’d gone off and left me wi’out so much as a line   i did n’t

give up hopes of ’ee yet   i went and wrote ’ee a letter and told ’ee to

come back  and all ’ud be forgive and forgot   there now  and what do ’ee

say to that ’



his face was working with emotion  his voice tremulous for all its

strength   never in his life  probably  had isaac sharpe put so many

words together  and every one of them came from his heart   to the young

people it seemed as though all their struggles had been futile  their

good desires vain  their great sacrifice useless  for all their days they

would be branded with infamy   they had  indeed  stopped short of the

breach of faith to which both had been so strongly tempted  but they had

nevertheless violated trust 



‘and even now ’ said isaac—‘even at the very last  when you were for

cuttin’ off wi’out no explanation  i did give ’ee one more chance—and you

would n’t take it ’



‘what in heaven’s name do you want to say ’ cried richard  goaded to

desperation   ‘do you want me to tell you to your face that i love the

woman you are going to marry ’



‘nay now ’ returned his uncle in an expostulatory tone  ‘i would n’t go

so far as that   i bain’t onreasonable   all i did ever think o’ axin’ ye

was for you and mrs  f  to see if ye could n’t take to each other   that

were my notion   ye might ha’ gived each other a fair trial—a fair

trial ’



the young couple stared at him blankly  hardly believing their ears  then

richard cried out with a gasp  ‘rosalie  do you hear—do you understand 

he  wanted  us to love each other ’



‘nay ’ interrupted the farmer  in a tone that was at once dignified and

explanatory  ‘i did n’t expect so much straight off—love   no  no  not

love—but ye mid ha’ jist tried to fancy one another   ye mid ha’ had a

bit o’ consideration for me  i think   ye knowed  both on ye  as

materimony would n’t come easy to i  and seein’ as you did tell me plain 

richard  the very first night you come home  as you was on the look out

for a wife  why not mrs  f  so well as another ’



it was rosalie’s turn to gasp now  and her face bloomed like a rose in

the evening light  but neither she nor richard spoke  both were so

suddenly brought down from their heights of heroics that it was natural

they should feel somewhat dizzy and confused 



‘i’m a man o’ my word ’ said isaac  ‘and if ye have made up your mind and

fixed your ch’ice on i  mrs  f   why’—drawing a deep breath—‘i’ll keep my

promise  my dear   but if richard ’ud do so well as me ’t ’ud be a deal

more convenient  d’ ye see   it ’ud seem a bit queer to change my state

at my time o’ life  and to leave the old home where i was born and bred 

and richard  he has a very good notion o’ farmin’  and he ’d be willing

to carry on the work in the old way  and to take advice from i  d’ ye

see   ah  the notion did come to i soon arter he comed here   thinks i to

myself  i wonder if richard ’ud do—’t ’ud be a deal more suitable  thinks

i  and more satisfactory to all parties ’



here isaac was interrupted by a sudden burst of laughter from his

nephew—laughter which was indeed the outlet of such an extraordinary

mixture of emotions that they had nearly found vent in tears   the

exquisite sense of relief  the unhoped for joy stirred his very heart’s

depths  but  on the other hand  the humour of the situation struck him

with almost equal force   after the overwhelming remorse  the bitter

sense of shame which but a few moments ago had tortured them  to discover

that their contemplated sacrifice had very nearly set at naught good old

isaac’s dearest wish 



‘oh  uncle  uncle ’ he cried as soon as the first ecstatic outburst of

mirth had subsided  ‘why did you not speak before ’



‘’t would n’t ha’ been very becomin’ for me to speak ’ returned the

farmer  still with great dignity   ‘i knowed my dooty to mrs  f   and i

were n’t a goin’ to say nothin’ as mid hurt her feelin’s   but i did try

and bring ye together  richard  and i did try to give ye so many hints as

i could   d’ ye mind how often i did say what a dear woman mrs  f  were 

and what a good wife she ’d make   ah  many a time i did   and d’ ye mind

how i used to tell ’ee it was bad to hurt a woman’s feelin’s   and you

would n’t take a bit o’ pains to be friendly and pleasant wi’ her   i did

look for some return from ’ee  richard  and i were disapp’inted   and i

did expect at least as ye would tell me straight whether you could take

to the notion or whether ye could n’t   ’t was the least ye mid do  i

think   i were that anxious  and that upset—i don’t see as it’s any

laughin’ matter ’ he continued with gathering wrath  for rosalie’s face

was now dimpling all over with smiles and richard’s hilarity seemed to

increase rather than diminish   ‘come  i’ll have a straight answer one

way or t’ other   will ye give up this here stupid notion o’ going out o’

the country  richard  and bide here and see if you and mrs  f  can’t make

it up between ye   and you  mrs  f   my dear  will ’ee jist think over

this here matter  and see if richard would n’t do as well as me ’



richard suddenly ceased laughing  and stepped to rosalie’s side 



‘will you  rosalie ’ he said  very gently and tenderly   ‘will you try to

like me a little ’



and  without waiting for an answer  he took her hands and laid them

softly about his own neck  and stooped and kissed her 



‘dear heart alive ’ exclaimed isaac  clapping his hands   ‘that were n’t

sich a bad beginning  richard  i will say   you bain’t very slack once

you do make a start ’  he paused to laugh  long and loud   ‘well  i

never ’ he cried   ‘nay  richard  ye don’t do things by halves   well 

mrs  f   my dear ’ he added  more anxiously  seeing that rosalie did not

speak  ‘what d’ ye say ’



‘i suppose ’ returned rosalie faintly  with her face half hidden on

richard’s shoulder  ‘i suppose i’ll have to try ’



‘do ’ee now  my dear ’ cried isaac  much relieved   ‘ye’ll find ye won’t

 re  pent it   and ye’ll not lose nothing by it neither ’ he added as an

afterthought   ‘richard be jist the same as a son to i—he’ll have all as

i ’ve a got to leave when i be gone   i don’t want for to seem unkind 

but it ’ud be a very great comfort to me if ye could make up your mind

to’t ’



‘oh  i think ’ murmured rosalie  ‘that i can make up my mind to it ’



‘well  then ’ cried isaac  chuckling and rubbing his hands  ‘all’s well

as ends well   ’ees  we may say that—all’s well as ends well   we’ll be

the best o’ friends as ever  but i do think as richard ’ull be more

suitable as a husband  my dear   ye mid as well see mrs  f  home now 

richard   i think i’ll go back to my bit o’ supper  ’t will be cold

enough by now  i reckon ’



with a nod and a broad smile he left them  and pursued his homeward way 

pausing ever and anon to look backwards at the two lithe young figures

which moved slowly along above the dark irregular line of hedge—the bent

heads  very close together  outlined against the lambent evening sky 

once  after one of these backward glances  he began to chuckle 



‘they’ve a took to the notion nicely ’ he said   ‘’ees  i reckon they’ll

do ’
