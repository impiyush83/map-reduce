preface 





the character and credit of the british army must chiefly depend

upon the zeal and ardour  by which all who enter into its service

are animated  and consequently it is of the highest importance that

any measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation  by which

alone great and gallant actions are achieved  should be adopted 



nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of this desirable

object  than a full display of the noble deeds with which the

military history of our country abounds  to hold forth these bright

examples to the imitation of the youthful soldier  and thus to

incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those who have

preceded him in their honourable career  are among the motives that

have given rise to the present publication 



the operations of the british troops are  indeed  announced in the

“london gazette ” from whence they are transferred into the public

prints  the achievements of our armies are thus made known at the

time of their occurrence  and receive the tribute of praise and

admiration to which they are entitled  on extraordinary occasions 

the houses of parliament have been in the habit of conferring on

the commanders  and the officers and troops acting under their

orders  expressions of approbation and of thanks for their skill

and bravery  and these testimonials  confirmed by the high honour

of their sovereign’s approbation  constitute the reward which the

soldier most highly prizes 



it has not  however  until late years  been the practice  which

appears to have long prevailed in some of the continental armies 

for british regiments to keep regular records of their services

and achievements  hence some difficulty has been experienced in

obtaining  particularly from the old regiments  an authentic

account of their origin and subsequent services 



this defect will now be remedied  in consequence of his majesty

having been pleased to command  that every regiment shall in future

keep a full and ample record of its services at home and abroad 



from the materials thus collected  the country will henceforth

derive information as to the difficulties and privations which

chequer the career of those who embrace the military profession  in

great britain  where so large a number of persons are devoted to

the active concerns of agriculture  manufactures  and commerce  and

where these pursuits have  for so long a period  been undisturbed

by the  presence of war   which few other countries have escaped 

comparatively little is known of the vicissitudes of active

service  and of the casualties of climate  to which  even during

peace  the british troops are exposed in every part of the globe 

with little or no interval of repose 



in their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the country

derives from the industry and the enterprise of the agriculturist

and the trader  its happy inhabitants may be supposed not often to

reflect on the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor   on

their sufferings   and on the sacrifice of valuable life  by which

so many national benefits are obtained and preserved 



the conduct of the british troops  their valour  and endurance 

have shone conspicuously under great and trying difficulties  and

their character has been established in continental warfare by the

irresistible spirit with which they have effected debarkations in

spite of the most formidable opposition  and by the gallantry and

steadiness with which they have maintained their advantages against

superior numbers 



in the official reports made by the respective commanders  ample

justice has generally been done to the gallant exertions of the

corps employed  but the details of their services  and of acts of

individual bravery  can only be fully given in the annals of the

various regiments 



these records are now preparing for publication  under his

majesty’s special authority  by mr  richard cannon  principal clerk

of the adjutant general’s office  and while the perusal of them

cannot fail to be useful and interesting to military men of every

rank  it is considered that they will also afford entertainment and

information to the general reader  particularly to those who may

have served in the army  or who have relatives in the service 



there exists in the breasts of most of those who have served 

or are serving  in the army  an  esprit de corps   an attachment

to every thing belonging to their regiment  to such persons a

narrative of the services of their own corps cannot fail to prove

interesting  authentic accounts of the actions of the great   the

valiant   the loyal  have always been of paramount interest with

a brave and civilized people  great britain has produced a race

of heroes who  in moments of danger and terror  have stood  “firm

as the rocks of their native shore ” and when half the world has

been arrayed against them  they have fought the battles of their

country with unshaken fortitude  it is presumed that a record of

achievements in war   victories so complete and surprising  gained

by our countrymen   our brothers   our fellow citizens in arms   a

record which revives the memory of the brave  and brings their

gallant deeds before us  will certainly prove acceptable to the

public 



biographical memoirs of the colonels and other distinguished

officers  will be introduced in the records of their respective

regiments  and the honorary distinctions which have  from time to

time  been conferred upon each regiment  as testifying the value

and importance of its services  will be faithfully set forth 



as a convenient mode of publication  the record of each regiment

will be printed in a distinct number  so that when the whole shall

be completed  the parts may be bound up in numerical succession

the aggressions of foreign princes  possessing extensive military

establishments  have repeatedly rendered considerable augmentations

to the british army necessary  for the preservation of the kingdom

and its numerous colonial possessions  and a circumstance of this

character occasioned the formation of the fifty sixth regiment 

during the winter of 1755 6 



the unjustifiable claims of france on certain portions of north

america   the forcible expulsion of a company of british settlers

from a tract of land beyond the allegany mountains  and near the

river ohio  by a body of french troops   and the building of a

fort to command the entrance into the country on the ohio and

mississippi rivers  thus excluding the english from a valuable

portion of their possessions  gave indication of an approaching war 



in december  1755  an order was issued for adding ten regiments of

infantry to the regular army  the seventh of these new regiments

was raised in the north of england  under the superintendence of

lord charles manners  who was nominated to the colonelcy  his

commission bearing date the 26th of december  1755  it was numbered

the fifty eighth foot  but two inefficient colonial corps being

soon afterwards disbanded   viz   major general shirley’s and

major general sir william pepperel’s   it obtained the rank of the

fifty sixth regiment 



 sidenote  1756 



active measures were adopted in the beginning of 1756  for

completing the numbers of the regiment to its establishment of

ten companies  of seventy eight non commissioned officers and

soldiers each  and its quarters were established at newcastle and

gateshead  its costume was scarlet  faced  lined  and turned up

with deep crimson  a few years afterwards the facing was changed to

a  purple   which had been denominated “ pompadour ” colour  this

circumstance gave rise to the fifty sixth regiment being commonly

styled “ the pompadours  ”

in the mean time  france had been deprived of all her possessions

in north america  and british troops  then employed in germany 

were opposing formidable resistance to the schemes of the court of

versailles  but the celebrated treaty  called the “family compact ”

between the sovereigns of france and spain  both bourbon princes  

gave a new character to the war  confiding in the prowess of his

seamen and soldiers  the british monarch did not shrink from the

unequal contest  but proclaimed war against spain on the 4th of

january  1762  and an expedition was afterwards prepared for the

attack of the valuable spanish settlement of the  havannah   in

the island of cuba  the fifty sixth regiment  being selected to

take part in this enterprise  sailed from portsmouth on the 5th of

march  and on arriving in the west indies  it joined the armament

under general the earl of albemarle  the colonel of the fifty sixth

regiment  the honorable william keppel  had the local rank of

major general in the expedition 



passing through the dangerous navigation of the straits of bahama

without accident  the fleet arrived off the havannah on the

6th of june  and a landing was effected on the following day 

the fifty sixth regiment mustered nine hundred and thirty three

officers and soldiers  under lieut  colonel james stewart  and

were formed in brigade with four companies of the royals  and a

battalion of the sixtieth  under brigadier general haviland 



the havannah  from its great importance  had been carefully

fortified  the entrance to the harbour  which is one of the finest

in the world  was secured on one side by the  moro  fort  built

of solid masonry on a projecting point of land  and having an

immense ditch cut out of the rock  the west side of the harbour

was defended by the puntal fort  and the town was surrounded by

a rampart  flanked with bastions  and strengthened by a ditch 

the reduction of the moro fort was the first object which engaged

the attention of the troops  and this service was intrusted

to major general the honorable william keppel  colonel of the

fifty sixth   his own regiment forming part of the force placed

under his orders  and having repeated opportunities of evincing

its spirit and perseverance in this arduous undertaking  rendered

particularly difficult by the oppressive heat  a scarcity of water 

the necessity of dragging the artillery along a rocky coast  and

from the thinness of the soil  so great was the labour in carrying

on the approaches  that several men were daily lost by diseases

produced by their extraordinary exertions  the destruction of

the grand battery by fire augmented the labours of the besieging

troops  but they resumed their work  repulsed a sortie of the

spaniards  and erected new batteries  on the 30th of july  a

storming party was formed under the orders of lieutenant colonel

stewart  of the late ninetieth regiment  disbanded on 18th march 

1763   two mines were sprung  a small practicable breach made 

and the british soldiers rushed in at the aperture with so much

impetuosity  that the spaniards were instantly overpowered  nearly

one hundred and fifty of the enemy were killed  four hundred threw

down their arms and were made prisoners  upwards of two hundred

endeavoured to escape in boats  but lost their lives in the attempt 



the spirited capture of the moro fort was followed by the erection

of a line of batteries on cavannos hill  commanding the eastern

side of the city  and the guns of the captured fort were also

turned against the spaniards  on the 11th of august the batteries

opened a well directed fire on the puntal fort and the town  and so

severe was the cannonade  that in less than six hours the enemy’s

guns were silenced  and the white flag hoisted  a capitulation was

concluded on the 13th  and possession was taken of the town and

puntal fort on the following day 



this valuable conquest was achieved by a division of the royal

navy  and a land force of fourteen thousand men  and it cost

upwards of a thousand officers and soldiers in killed and deaths

from extraordinary exertions 



the fifty sixth regiment had twelve rank and file killed  one

officer and twenty three rank and file wounded  the regiment also

sustained the loss of many brave men from diseases 



for its distinguished conduct on this occasion  the regiment was

honored with the royal authority to bear the word “moro” on its

regimental colours  which forms a conspicuous feature in its

record  few corps having acquired an honorary inscription for their

colours on their first service

the regiment remained at the havannah several months  the garrison

being under the order of its colonel  major general the honorable

william keppel  a treaty of peace was soon afterwards concluded 

and the havannah was restored to spain in exchange for florida  it

was  accordingly  delivered up to the spanish troops on the 7th of

july  1763 



in september  the fifty sixth regiment embarked for ireland  and

landing in the following month  marched to limerick  its numbers

being completed by volunteers from other corps

equipment of certain regiments of cavalry and infantry  and a

communication  dated dublin  9th october  1764  made known to the

fifty sixth regiment  “his majesty’s pleasure  that the facings of

the clothing of the fifty sixth regiment of foot  under the command

marched to cork in may  1770  and embarked from thence for that

important fortress 



in december an order was received for augmenting the regiment  by

the addition of a light infantry company of three serjeants  three

the regiment was stationed at gibraltar during the following twelve

years  the american war commenced in 1775  and three hanoverian

regiments afterwards joined the garrison of gibraltar  in 1778

france united with the revolted british subjects  and the spanish

monarch contrived to introduce himself into the dispute  in the

character of a mediator  but his proposals were of so injurious

a character to the interests of great britain  that they were

instantly rejected  the king of spain then seized on what appeared

to be a favorable opportunity to declare war  and to wrest from

great britain the important fortress of  gibraltar   which had

resisted every attempt to retake it  since its capture by the

british in 1704 



in june  1779  the intercourse of the garrison of gibraltar with

the spanish territory was suddenly stopped  so that several

officers on leave of absence  experienced difficulty in rejoining

their corps  a numerous spanish army speedily blockaded the

fortress on the land side  and the garrison became insulated from

the rest of the world  resolving on a desperate defence of the

fortress intrusted to their care  the troops undertook the task

with cheerfulness  and severe toil and spare diet were sustained

without complaint  the works were increased  the pavement of the

streets was taken up  the towers of conspicuous buildings pulled

down  the stone sentry boxes removed  guard houses unroofed 

traverses were raised in different places  and a covered way begun 

several staff appointments took place  among others  major hardy 

of the fifty sixth  was nominated quarter master general  captain

valloton  aide de camp to the governor  and lieutenant s  wood 

assistant town major  the regiment was commanded by major bulleine

a rigorous blockade being established by sea and land  a scarcity

of provision was soon experienced  the soldiers  being resolutely

determined to defend their position  submitted to privations which

were unavoidable  although the scurvy made great ravages among

them  and reduced their numbers  early in 1780 admiral sir george

rodney arrived with a convoy  to the great joy and relief of the

garrison  which was augmented by the second battalion of the

seventy third regiment 



the british fleet having departed  the spaniards renewed the

blockade by sea  and attempted to destroy the vessels in the

harbour by fire ships  but failed  towards the close of the year 

provision again became short  a limited supply was occasionally

obtained from the moors  the effects of the scurvy were mitigated

by cultivating vegetables on the rock  and the gallant defenders

of gibraltar maintained their attitude of defiance to the power of

spain 



 sidenote  1781 



in april  1781  the garrison was again relieved by the arrival of a

numerous fleet under vice admiral darby 



this success occasioned the spaniards to lose all hope of being

able to reduce the fortress by blockade  and they resolved to try

the power of their numerous artillery  scarcely had the fleet

cast anchor  when the enemy’s batteries opened  and the fire of

upwards of one hundred guns and mortars enveloped the fortress in

a storm of war  a number of gun boats augmented the iron tempest

which beat against the rock  and the houses of the inhabitants were

soon in ruins  surgeon thomas chisholm  of the fifty sixth  was

severely wounded by the splinter of a shell  on the 15th of april 

lieutenant edward vicars of the regiment was also wounded on the

26th of october  and ensign richard edgar on the 3rd of november 



europe watched  with intense interest  the heroic conduct of the

garrison  and the english governor deliberately observed the

approaches of the enemy  and seized  with the keenest perspection 

the proper moment to make a sortie with success  this occurred on

the night of the 26th of november  when the flank companies of

the fifty sixth had an opportunity of distinguishing themselves 

the moon shone bright on the sands as the soldiers assembled at

midnight  between two and three o’clock  darkness overspread

the country  and the troops issued silently from the fortress 

they were challenged and fired upon by the enemy’s sentries  but

the british soldiers rushed forward with their native ardour 

overpowered the spanish guards  and captured the batteries in

gallant style  the defenders of the works flying in dismay  and

communicating the panic to the troops in their rear  the wooden

batteries were soon prepared for fire  the flames spread with

astonishing rapidity  and a column of fire and smoke arose from

the works  illuminating the surrounding objects  and shedding a

fiery lustre upon this unparalleled scene  in an hour the object

of the sortie was effected  trains were laid to the enemy’s

magazines  and the soldiers withdrew  as they entered the fortress

tremendous explosions shook the ground  and rising columns of

smoke  flame  and burning timber  proclaimed the destruction of

the enemy’s immense stores of gunpowder to be completed  general

eliott declared in orders   “the bearing and conduct of the whole

detachment   officers  seamen  and soldiers   on this glorious

occasion  surpass my utmost acknowledgments ”



the spaniards appeared astounded at this disgrace  they made no

attempt to extinguish the flames  but appeared at a loss how to

proceed  early in december they began to arouse themselves  and

to restore the batteries  but were retarded by the fire of the

garrison  while the besiegers were using diligence in repairing

the old works  and constructing new ones  the gallant defenders of

the fortress were equally indefatigable   every serjeant  drummer 

musician  officer’s servant  and private soldier was required to

use the musket  shovel  and pickaxe  as his services were necessary

all ordinary means of attack appearing to be unavailing against

the resolute garrison of gibraltar  stupendous preparations were

made on a new principle  and floating batteries were constructed

with great art and labour  and were accounted the most perfect

contrivance of the kind ever seen  the combined power of france

and spain was directed against the fortress  the duke of crillon

took the command of the besieging army  and he was assisted by a

celebrated french engineer  monsieur d’arcon  as the summer of 1782

progressed  the garrison was aware that a crisis was approaching 

and awaited with cool determination the hour of trial  sickness and

the enemy’s fire thinned their numbers  lieutenant white  of the

fifty sixth  being among the wounded   yet their efforts were not

relaxed  new subterraneous works were constructed  and furnaces

prepared for heating red hot shot 



a trial of hot shot was made in the early part of september 

and some of the enemy’s works were set on fire  this unexpected

disaster provoked the duke of crillon to hurry the attack of a

number of new batteries  which opened with a volley of sixty

shells  and was followed by the fire of one hundred and seven

guns of large calibre  a tremendous storm of bullets and shells

thundered against the fortress  and soon after  the immense

battering ships approached and took their station  princes of the

royal blood of france   spanish nobility   dignified characters of

europe   and an amazing concourse of persons filling the enemy’s

camp  and covering the adjacent hills  to witness the fall of the

fortress under the fire of these stupendous vessels 



the batteries of the garrison opened their fire  and the roar of

four hundred heavy guns proclaimed the dreadful conflict  the

battering ships proved powerful  the heaviest shells rebounded

from their tops  and a thirty two pound shot scarcely seemed

to make an impression on them  sometimes smoke arose  but the

engines in the ships soon caused it to disappear  the effect of

the red hot shot was doubted  the result uncertain  but the fire

was persevered in  and showers of balls  shells  and carcasses 

flew through the air  for some hours the attack and defence were

so equally well supported  as scarcely to admit of any appearance

of superiority in the cannonade on either side  the wonderful

construction of the battering ships appeared to bid defiance to

the powers of the heaviest ordnance and of red hot balls  in the

afternoon  13th september  the face of things began to change 

and the smoke issuing from the upper part of the enemy’s flagship

became more voluminous  a second ship soon appeared in the same

condition  confusion prevailed  the enemy’s cannonade began to

abate  signals of distress were made to their fleet  and groans

and cries of suffering came from the burning ships  soon after

midnight one battering ship was in flames  in a short time a second

appeared in the same state  and between three and four o’clock six

more exhibited the effects of the red hot shot  a dreadful scene

of conflagration illuminated the bay of gibraltar  and the british

seamen were seen rescuing their enemies from impending destruction 



although defeated in this grand effort  the spaniards entertained

some hope of being able to reduce the garrison to submission

from the want of provision  and the siege was continued  but in

october the combined fleets of france and spain were damaged by a

storm  after this event the garrison was again relieved  supplied

with provisions  and reinforced with troops  and the officers and

soldiers were encouraged to persevere in their gallant efforts 

by a letter from the principal secretary of state  published

in orders  in which it was stated   “i am honored with his

majesty’s commands to assure you  in the strongest terms  that no

encouragement shall be wanting to the brave officers and soldiers

under your command  his majesty’s royal approbation of the past

will  no doubt  be a powerful incentive to future exertion  and i

have the king’s authority to assure you  that every distinguished

act of emulation and gallantry  which shall be performed in the

course of the siege  by any  even of the lowest rank  will meet

with ample reward from his gracious protection and favour ”



thus encouraged  the brave garrison of gibraltar stood firm and

determined in the defence of the fortress  and the enemy lost all

hopes of being able to gain possession of the place

preliminary articles for a treaty of peace having been signed 

hostilities ceased in february  1783  and gibraltar remained one of

the gems of the british crown  after a determined siege of three

years  seven months  and twelve days  from the commencement of the

blockade 



thus terminated the celebrated siege of gibraltar  the nations of

europe were struck with admiration of the gallant defenders of the

fortress  the british people applauded their governor and his brave

garrison  and the officers and soldiers received the thanks of

parliament and the approbation of their sovereign 



  “in commemoration of the glorious defence made by the regiments

  of infantry which composed the garrison of gibraltar during the

  late memorable siege of that fortress ” the fifty sixth regiment

  received the royal authority to bear on its regimental colours

  the word “gibraltar ” with the device of a “castle and key ” and

  the motto “ montis insignia calpe  ”



in pursuance of an arrangement made by his majesty’s command  the

several regiments were at this period directed to assume  county

titles   and to cultivate a connexion with such parts of the

kingdom  with the view of promoting the recruiting of the army  the

fifty sixth received the title of the west essex regiment

his men fired on the assassin  and several rioters were killed and

wounded  a monument was erected to the memory of major valloton

in august the regiment marched to cork  and was held in readiness

to proceed on foreign service  the french republicans had added

to their other atrocities the decapitation of their sovereign 

war had commenced  and the fifty sixth regiment was selected to

join an expedition to the west indies  under general sir charles

the flank companies of the regiment were formed in grenadier and

light infantry battalions  and  with the battalion companies 

proceeded against the island of  martinico   a landing was effected

at three different points in the early part of february  1794 

and some sharp fighting occurred  in which the fifty sixth 

particularly the flank companies  had the honor to take part  and

in a short period this valuable island was captured by the british

arms  sir charles grey stated in his despatch   “the general and

field officers and the commanding officers of corps  have set such

an example of zeal  activity  and animation in this service  which

has been so laudably imitated by all the officers and soldiers of

this little army  that they merit the greatest praise ”



leaving the battalion companies at martinico  the flank companies

proceeded with the expedition against  st  lucia   the grenadiers

being in the brigade under prince edward  afterwards duke of kent  

and the light company in that commanded by major general dundas 

the troops employed on this service arrived at st  lucia on the

1st of april  and the conquest of that fine island was achieved in

three days 



the army afterwards proceeded against the island of  guadeloupe  

and the fifty sixth had the honor to share in this enterprise  a

determined resistance was made by the french republicans  but the

island was captured before the end of april  and the commander of

the forces declared he could not find words to express “the high

sense he entertained of the extraordinary merit evinced by the

officers and soldiers in this service ”



the regiment was afterwards stationed at grenada and martinico 

and a great loss of life having been sustained from the effects

of climate and other causes  an order was received in october  to

transfer the men of the fifty sixth  fit for duty  to the sixth 

ninth  and fifteenth regiments

on the 3rd of january  1795  the officers  staff  and such

non commssioned officers and soldiers as had not been transferred

to other corps embarked from martinico  and sailed for england 

they arrived at gravesend on the 18th of february  and were

stationed at chatham  active measures were adopted to recruit the

ranks of the regiment 



after commanding the regiment nearly thirty years  general walsh

great success had attended the recruiting and training of the

regiment  and although one year only had elapsed since its return

from the west indies a skeleton  it had attained so perfect a

state of discipline and efficiency  that in the early part of 1796

it proceeded to barbadoes  from whence it was detached to st

employed at the taking of  bombarde  in the district of mole  st

arriving at gravesend on the 31st of january  1799  the regiment

landed  and proceeded to chatham  it was afterwards removed to

different counties in england  and active measures were adopted

with success to recruit its diminished numbers 



at this period a favorable opportunity appeared to present itself

for rescuing holland from the power of france  into which it had

fallen during the early part of 1795  and a plan of co operation

was concerted between great britain and russia  in the expectation

that the dutch would rise against the french  and  aided by the

anglo russian force  would exert themselves to effect their

emancipation  the fifty sixth being selected to share in this

enterprise  joined the troops at barham downs on the 31st of july 

and in the middle of september embarked at deal for holland 



the regiment joined the anglo russian army  under his royal

highness the duke of york  in time to take a distinguished part

in the attack of the enemy’s positions on the 19th of september 

on this occasion the first operations of the several columns

were successful  but the hopes  which a brilliant commencement

afforded  of a general and decisive victory  were destroyed by the

hasty valour  and the want of that precaution which the art of war

prescribes  on the part of the russians under general hermann 

who were repulsed by an enemy inferior to themselves in numbers

and valour  but superior in science and prudence  this disaster

rendered it necessary for the army to resume its position  the

fifty sixth regiment had thirty rank and file killed on this

occasion  captains king and gilman  lieutenant prater  thirty three

rank and file  wounded  one serjeant  one drummer  and fifty seven

rank and file  missing  the duke of york stated in his public

despatch   “the gallantry displayed by the troops engaged  the

spirit with which they overcame every obstacle which nature and art

opposed to them  and the cheerfulness with which they maintained

the fatigues of an action which lasted  without intermission  from

half past three o’clock in the morning until five in the afternoon 

are beyond my powers to describe  their exertions fully entitle

them to the admiration and gratitude of their king and country ”



on the 2nd of october a successful attack was made on the enemy’s

positions between bergen and egmont op zee  and the action “was 3 

sustained by the british columns under those highly distinguished

officers  general sir ralph abercromby and lieut  general dundas 

whose exertions  as well as the gallantry of the brave troops they

led  cannot have been surpassed by any former instance of british

valour ”



during the night the enemy fell back  and the british advance posts

moved forward on the following day  on the 6th of october the

enemy’s posts were again attacked with success  and the british

maintained a forward position 



although the army under the duke of york was victorious in its

engagements  yet the dutch people were not stimulated  by these

spirited exertions  to rise in arms against their oppressors  and

several circumstances having occurred which indicated that the

expedition was not likely to be eventually successful  the duke of

york resolved to evacuate the country 



the regiment embarked from north holland on the 18th of november 

landed at yarmouth on the 20th  and marched to chelmsford  in

december it proceeded to horsham

afterwards proceeded to clonmel  fermoy   c  two companies  of one

hundred rank and file each  were added to the establishment 



while at these stations  the regiment was conspicuous for its

correct discipline and efficiency  and after the usual inspection 

on the 29th of october  the following garrison order was

issued   “major general sir charles ross is happy to have this

opportunity of expressing his approbation of the steadiness and

appearance of the fifty sixth regiment this day  and returns his

the regiment  after its return from the west indies  in the

early part of 1799  had been recruited with men for limited

service in europe  but when the glorious triumphs of the british

army in egypt  under general sir ralph abercromby  k b   were

made known to the corps in general orders  this announcement

of splendid victories  gained by english troops  created so

lively an interest in the regiment  that the soldiers instantly

responded with a tender of service in any quarter of the globe 

which was communicated to the general officer of the district 

brigadier general champagne  by major h  s  keating  commanding the

regiment at the time  in the following terms 



  “sir   i have the honor to inclose you the offer of the

  fifty sixth regiment  of serving in any part of the world  where

  his majesty may deem it necessary  which i beg you will have the

  goodness to lay before his excellency the commander in chief 

  i should consider myself acting with injustice  were i not to

  notice the very enthusiastic manner in which the orders of the

  16th may  1801 4   of his royal highness the duke of york  were

  received  and the consequent tender of those services excited by

  a contemplation of the animated conduct of our gallant army in

  egypt  and i feel a confidence in adding  that should they be

  accepted  i have every reliance  that the spirit and energy of

  the regiment  will support with honor the interest of its king

  and country ”



the commander of the forces in ireland directed the

adjutant general to convey to the non commissioned officers and

privates of the regiment  “his thanks and approbation of their

spirited offer of general service  which is transmitted to his

royal highness the commander in chief  to be laid before the

king ” the duke of york also communicated “his thanks to the corps

for their spirited and loyal offer to extend their service to any

part of the world ”

this tender of service was  however  so speedily followed by the

peace of amiens  concluded in the early part of 1802  that no call

was made  at this period  for the regiment to proceed on foreign

service  in october it marched to limerick

hostilities were resumed in 1803  and bonaparte’s threat of

invading england was answered by a sudden assumption of arms

throughout the kingdom  which produced an array of military power 

that proved how highly the british people prized their constitution

and liberties  and deterred the french from quitting their own

coast  the regiment proceeded to galway in august  and was

afterwards removed to tuam  loughrea  and kinsale

among the measures adopted to repel the french invasion  an

additional force act was passed in june  1804  and four hundred of

the men  raised under its provisions  in the county of surrey  were

constituted the  second battalion  of the fifty sixth regiment 

they were embodied at farnham  and the battalion was placed on

the establishment of the army on the 25th of december  1804 

it was augmented soon afterwards to six hundred and fifty six

non commissioned officers and soldiers

the first battalion remained in ireland until january  1805 

when it embarked at kinsale for the isle of wight  where its

establishment was augmented to one thousand rank and file  which

was speedily completed  and in april it embarked in three divisions

for the east indies  it landed at bombay in august  and was

stationed at that city several years 



in may the second battalion left farnham  and was stationed

a short time at the barracks at forton and gosport  in august

after remaining at guernsey twelve months  the second battalion

returned to the isle of wight  it was in a high state of discipline

and efficiency  and in june it embarked in two divisions for india 

the fleet encountered a severe gale of wind  and the vessels of the

first division parted company  and put into simon’s bay to refit 

they remained at the cape of good hope a month  and afterwards

continued the voyage to madras  where they arrived in december 

under convoy of the greyhound frigate  on arrival in india the

several companies proceeded to bombay  where both battalions were

stationed in 1808  the success which attended the recruiting of

the regiment  occasioning the establishment of the first battalion

to be augmented to thirteen hundred non commissioned officers and

soldiers 



 sidenote  1809 



in january  1809  the second battalion marched to barachie  near

surat 



meanwhile british commerce had experienced considerable

interruption and some loss from the french naval force stationed in

the indian sea  which force rendezvoused at the island of bourbon 

and the isle of france  or the mauritius   in january two hundred

men of the first battalion were detached from bombay  to join the

troops assembling at the island of roderigue  under lieut  colonel

keating  of the fifty sixth regiment  for the attack of the french

islands in the indian sea 



while this detachment of the first battalion was on the voyage 

four companies of the second battalion marched to baroda  under

the orders of captain d  daly  and joined the force assembling

at that place  under lieut  colonel walker  for the reduction of

the fort of  mallia   in kattawar  which was the stronghold of

a numerous body of marauders  who plundered and devastated the

surrounding territory  and had successfully resisted the attacks

of powerful native chiefs  which had procured for their fort

the reputation of being impregnable  the position was naturally

strong  the fortifications good  the garrison  being fully aware

of the approach of the british troops  was prepared  and  to

gain additional security  had surrounded the wall with a strong

embankment of earth and thorns 



after a long and fatiguing march the british troops arrived before

mallia on the 6th of july  and the garrison returning a vaunting

answer to the summons to surrender  the fire of the artillery

commenced on the following day  and a practicable breach was

effected in a few hours 



at four o’clock in the afternoon the storming party  of which

the fifty sixth furnished a proportion of one hundred and fifty

rank and file  advanced  the forlorn hope being under the command

of captain mckenzie  of the bombay european regiment  who was

gallantly supported by lieutenant newman of the fifty sixth  a

volunteer on the occasion  rushing forward with heroic valour  the

soldiers soon forced the breach  and in less than three quarters of

an hour they were in possession of the greater part of the town  as

they advanced  the resistance became more determined  the banditti

fighting with great spirit  and eventually retiring into an inner

fort  which was inaccessible to an assault  when  the evening being

far advanced  operations ceased for the night  before the following

morning the defenders of mallia withdrew through a sally port  and

fled  a few men remaining to keep up an occasional fire  and these

retired before daylight  when the fort was occupied by the british

troops 



this place having been accounted by the natives of the kattawar as

impregnable  its early reduction  with the cool and steady valour

by which it was carried  filled with astonishment and admiration

the several vakeels of the different chieftains  who were in

attendance on lieut  colonel walker  and afforded them proof of the

irresistible effects of british discipline  skill  and prowess 

this afterwards operated beneficially in producing the organization

of so rude and uncivilized a tract of country  as the greater part

of the peninsula of guzerat then was 



in the general orders issued on this occasion  it was stated   “to

captain d  daly  the officers and men of the fifty sixth regiment 

the commanding officer returns his particular acknowledgments 

they have nobly supported the reputation of the senior battalion 

in all the characteristics of good soldiers ”     “the commanding

officer cannot omit the expression of his warmest acknowledgments

to captain arnot  of the fifty sixth regiment  for his exertions at

the erection of the batteries  and for his conduct at the storm 

and it would be injustice to withhold his thanks to lieutenant

newman  for his spirited support of captain mckenzie in the

advanced party ”



the casualties  amounting to eighty two killed and wounded  prove

the arduous nature of the enterprise  and of this number the

fifty sixth regiment had six rank and file killed  captain arnot 

and twelve rank and file wounded  in december the troops were

ordered to return to their former stations  and the detachment of

the fifty sixth rejoined the head quarters of the second battalion

at barachie 



meanwhile the party of the first battalion at the isle

of roderigue had sailed from thence with the forces under

lieut  colonel keating  to co operate with the british navy in

blockading the isles of france and bourbon  and in attacking the

enemy’s ports  at five o’clock on the morning of the 21st of

september  six hundred men landed in three columns  seven miles

from the port of  st  paul’s   in the isle of bourbon  then called

by the french the isle of bonaparte  and by a forced march crossed

a causeway extending over the lake  before the enemy discovered

their disembarkation or approach to the town  they also passed the

enemy’s strongest position by seven o’clock  and gained possession

of two batteries before the enemy could form in force  captain

imlack  of the bombay native infantry  was detached with one

hundred and fifty men to take possession of a third battery  and

on his way he encountered the french forces  concentrated behind a

stone wall  with eight field pieces on their flanks  this post was

instantly attacked in a most gallant manner  captain hanna of the

fifty sixth regiment arrived with the third column  and charging 

captured two guns  and captain forbes  of the fifty sixth regiment 

advancing with the reserve  the enemy was compelled to retreat with

the loss of his artillery  a few men were detached in pursuit  two

additional batteries were captured  and by half past eight o’clock

the town  batteries  magazines  eight brass field pieces  and one

hundred and seventeen new iron guns  were in possession of the

british troops  at the same time the enemy’s shipping were forced

to surrender to the british naval force  thus was accomplished a

most brilliant exploit  in a few hours  and it reflected great

credit on the commanding officer  lieut  colonel keating  of

the fifty sixth  and on all the troops engaged  the loss of the

regiment was one serjeant  and five rank and file killed  one

serjeant and twenty six rank and file wounded 



the town being commanded by the british naval force  the troops

returned on board the fleet  part of the enemy’s stores and the

guns were destroyed  the remainder were embarked on board the

company’s recaptured ship streatham  which  with the europe  were

placed under their former commanders  in october the troops sailed

for the isle of roderigue  the conduct of ensign pearce  of the

fifty sixth regiment  was highly commended in the public despatch

of lieut  colonel keating 



in the beginning of this year  a detachment of the regiment  under

lieutenant john elliot cairnes  performed duty as marines  in

the indian sea  on board of his majesty’s ship psyche  which was

engaged in the war with the rajah of travancore  who governed a

populous province at the south west extremity of hindoostan  this

province was indebted for its independence to the valour of british

troops  who rescued it from the power of tippoo sultan  when the

forces of the mysore had overrun the country  in 1790  and in 1795

a treaty of alliance was concluded with the rajah  who engaged to

subsidize three battalions of british sepoys for the defence of

his dominions  some disputes arising from the payments to be made

in consequence of this treaty  produced war  the british sepoys

stationed at quilon were menaced with annihilation  the house of

the resident  colonel c  macauly  at cochin  was attacked  and the

twelfth and nineteenth british regiments were suddenly ordered to

the scene of contest  a detachment of the fifty sixth  on board

the piedmontaise frigate  were employed in services connected with

the safety of the troops at quilon  and the preservation of the

life of the british resident  this frigate cannonaded the port of

aleppi  where a party of the twelfth foot had been treacherously

seized  their wrists broken with a heavy piece of iron  their

hands tied behind them  and after lying several days in a dungeon 

were precipitated from a rock into the sea  this detachment of

the fifty sixth landed at quilon  under lieutenant warren  to

co operate in the preservation of the life of the british resident 

who had escaped from cochin  the services of the detachment under

lieutenant cairnes  on board of the psyche  were connected with the

operations of the army under brigadier general the honorable a  st 

leger  and under the cover of the frigate’s broadside  the soldiers

of the regiment stormed and captured a strong battery  commanding

 colatchi bay   thus co operating in the capture of  travandrum  

the capital  which reduced the refractory rajah of travancore to

submission 



measures for enforcing a system of economy  having interfered with

the emoluments which british officers in the command of native

regiments had been accustomed to receive  from the contract for

supplying their corps with camp equipment  the civil and military

authorities of madras became opposed to each other  from this

misunderstanding resulted serious disaffection and disobedience of

orders in the native army  and the head quarters and companies of

the first battalion of the fifty sixth at bombay  were suddenly

ordered to madras  they embarked on board the cornwallis frigate

and two transports  on the 30th of july  under secret orders  and

landed at madras on the 11th of august  before any disclosure

of the approach of this reinforcement had reached the army of

that presidency  the governor addressed a communication to the

regiment on this occasion  in which he stated he felt  “particular

satisfaction that the selection for this delicate service had

fallen to the first battalion of the fifty sixth regiment  whose

distinguished and characteristic zeal for the maintenance of

professional subordination to the authority of legal government 

must so powerfully tend to recall the misguided to a sense of their

duty ”



the regiment proceeded to the marmalong camp immediately  and

after the return of the native corps to their duty  it received

the thanks of the governor in council  in general orders   “for

the manner in which his majesty’s officers and soldiers  who

rallied round the cause of government  loyalty  and duty  conducted

themselves ” in october the battalion proceeded to bellary 



 sidenote  1810 



these troubles being suppressed  the governor general conceived

the idea of clearing the indian ocean of all that was hostile

to great britain  and a considerable force was placed under the

orders of lieut  colonel keating  of the fifty sixth  including a

strong detachment of the first battalion of the regiment  for the

capture of the island of  bourbon   on this occasion lieut  colonel

keating resolved to make his first attack on the capital  in the

expectation that  with its capture  the reduction of the island

would be accomplished  a landing was effected at grand chaloupe

on the 7th of july  1810  and captain hanna was detached with two

companies of the fifty sixth to  la possessime   “the batteries of

which place he took by assault in the most gallant manner 5  ” and

with the trifling loss of two men killed  and two wounded  thus

proving the advantage of making attacks with spirit and resolution 

all the troops of the expedition conducting themselves with heroic

ardour  the opposition of the enemy was speedily overcome  and the

conquest of the island accomplished in so short a period of time 

that lieutenant colonel keating stated in his public despatch   “in

all the operations the troops evinced the native energy and

gallantry of britons  and in a few hours this rich  extensive  and

valuable colony was added to the british dominions ” lieutenant

mallet and a party of the regiment  proceeded with the french

troops which had surrendered  to the cape of good hope 



additional troops arriving at this part of the indian ocean 

major general j  abercromby assumed the command  and an expedition

proceeded against the  isle of france   which was afterwards

restored to its original designation of the  mauritius   and the

detachment of the fifty sixth regiment had the honor to serve

in this enterprise  the party which proceeded  under lieutenant

mallet  in charge of french prisoners to the cape  arriving in time

to take part in this service  a landing was effected in the bay

of mapon on the 29th of november  and the troops advanced through

a thick wood  when some skirmishing occurred  and lieut  colonel

keating  of the fifty sixth regiment  and twelve men of the piquet 

were wounded  penetrating the open country on the following day 

the troops experienced great inconvenience from the want of water 

and halted at the streams of the powder mills  five miles from port

louis  after passing the night at this place  they resumed the

march  and were opposed in their progress by a strong body of the

enemy  when some severe fighting occurred  in which the british

soldiers were triumphant  the fifty sixth regiment had five men

killed and several wounded 



pursuing their victorious career  the british troops advanced

to the enemy’s lines  and on the following morning the french

commander  general de caen  proposed to capitulate  thus was this

valuable colony wrested from the enemy  and it has continued to

form part of the possessions of the british crown to the present

time 



during this year the star of britain shone bright on the naval and

colonial affairs of this great maritime power  whose enemies were

deprived of the last establishment which they had possessed beyond

the cape of good hope  and the pompadours had the honor of sharing

in these brilliant adventures 



the second battalion remained at barachia  and so successful was

the recruiting of the regiment  under the influence and zealous

efforts of its colonel  lieut  general the hon  chapple norton 

that the establishment of the second battalion was augmented to

one thousand three hundred and six non commissioned officers

and soldiers  making the number of the two battalions in india 

two thousand six hundred and twelve  and  notwithstanding the

casualties of war and climate  the effectives approximated the

establishment  a strong detachment of volunteers from the militia

two companies of the second battalion were ordered to garrison

surat  in february  1813  and the head quarters embarked for the

guzerat  where they arrived at the dutch bundes in surat on the

quarters  the battalion was removed in april  to domus  where it

was encamped  but re occupied the dutch bundes in june  with two

companies at surat 



four companies were detached  in the same month  under the command

of captain barrington  to join the guicwar’s subsidiary force 

under the orders of colonel holmes  of the east india company’s

service  on the third day the four companies marched from khim to

oclasceer  a distance of eighteen miles  the last six of which

were across an arid plain  destitute of shelter  and exposed

to an unusual degree of heat  when many men fell from complete

exhaustion  three died where they fell  and seven others expired

during the day  after they had been removed to quarters by the

natives  these four companies were followed  in september  by two

others  under lieut  colonel kingscote who assumed the command

of the six companies with the force under colonel holmes  which

was employed in operations for the re establishment of the

rightful heir to the throne  which had been usurped by the uncle 

on the 15th of november this force took possession of the fort

of  palampore   which the scindians had evacuated early in the

morning  the troops remained in the neighbourhood of this place

until the end of the year  when the companies of the fifty sixth

marched back to the camp at domus  where the guzerat fever deprived

the corps of many valuable soldiers 



notwithstanding its numerous losses  the recruiting of the regiment

was conducted with great success  under the influence and zealous

efforts of its colonel  and its ranks received a constant supply

of young men  many of them from the county of surrey  at this

period the war in europe had attained a crisis  the british forces

had triumphed in portugal and spain  and had forced the barrier

of the pyrenees and penetrated france  the emperor napoleon had

lost a numerous army in the north  the forces of russia  austria 

prussia  and the german states  were in arms against him  and a

powerful effort promised complete success to the cause of the

allies  measures were adopted to augment the british army at this

interesting period  and the facility with which the fifty sixth had

been recruited  holding out the prospect that its establishment

might be increased  a warrant was issued by the prince regent in

the early part of november  for adding a  third battalion  to the

corps  this battalion was embodied at horsham  its establishment

was six hundred and fifty non commissioned officers and soldiers 

and its ranks were so speedily completed with disciplined men  by

volunteers from the militia   c   that in one month from the date

of the order for its formation  it was ready for foreign service 

at this period a body of british troops proceeded to holland  under

lieutenant general sir thomas graham  late lord lynedoch   to

co operate with the forces of the allied sovereigns  and the third

battalion of the fifty sixth embarked for this service at ramsgate

about the same period the first battalion took the field in india 

and formed part of the force assembled at goute  from whence

it proceeded against  canool   where it arrived on the 25th of

december  and batteries were erected during the night  but a flag

of truce being sent out on the following morning  hostilities

ceased  the battalion was also at the reduction of the fort

of  raree   goosecull  and passed the monsoon in quarters at

cataubaugy  afterwards returning to goute  it was relieved in the

field by the second battalion of the royals  it had lost three

hundred and fifty men from disease  and was so reduced  that it was

ordered to return to bellary  it subsequently marched to fort st 

george  madras 



the third battalion did not remain many days in quarters in holland

before it was employed in active operations  in consequence of a

request of the prussian general  bulow  that the british would make

a forward movement upon  antwerp   to favour his operations  the

english general accordingly advanced to make a reconnoissance  and

approaching that fortress on the 13th of january  attacked a body

of french troops at the village of  merxem   on this occasion the

fifty sixth supported the seventy eighth highlanders  in a charge

with the bayonet  on a french column  which was driven from its

ground  the fifty sixth were engaged in a sharp skirmish  and had

four men killed and fourteen wounded  the object of this movement

having been accomplished  the british troops marched to rosendael 



a serious attack on antwerp was afterwards concerted  and general

bulow engaged to support the british with his prussian corps 

an advance was accordingly made  and on the 2nd of february the

english again approached the village of merxem  where a numerous

body of french troops were stationed  and had fortified their post 

the light troops commenced skirmishing about nine o’clock in the

morning  and the fifty sixth  having cleared the wood on the right

and left  formed line and advanced  when they were ordered by sir

thomas graham  in person  to move to the right   charge through

the village   ford the dike on the other side   take the enemy’s

battery   and attack them on the left of their line  these orders

were gallantly executed  and two guns  which had annoyed the

advance  were captured  the fifty sixth sustained some loss from

the enemy’s fire  and had several men drowned in crossing the dike 

but they succeeded in gaining the left flank of the enemy  and were

warmly engaged until the french retired under the guns of antwerp 

when they pursued until recalled  and ordered to take post under

the embankment of st  ferdinand’s dike  which was not accomplished

before several round shot had passed through the ranks  the

regiment had thirteen rank and file killed  ensign sparks  and

twenty four rank and file wounded  lieut  general sir thomas graham

stated in his despatch   “all the troops engaged behaved with the

usual spirit and intrepidity of british soldiers ” and the conduct

of lieut  colonel brown of the fifty sixth was particularly noticed 



after this success the british troops were employed in constructing

a breastwork and battery  and the fifty sixth took their share in

this labour  the men working all night  on the 3rd of february 

several pieces of heavy ordnance opened upon the city of antwerp 

and on the french shipping in the scheldt  and the cannonade was

continued until the 6th  the fifty sixth taking their turn in the

trenches  and being under fire each day  but general bulow having

received orders to march southward  to act with the grand army

of the allies  it became necessary to relinquish the attack on

antwerp  when the british retired towards breda   the fifty sixth

halting a few days at rysburg  ten miles from breda 



in the beginning of march the battalion again moved towards

antwerp  and was employed in services connected with preventing the

enemy throwing a relief into  bergen op zoom   which fortress sir

thomas graham had resolved to attack  and the battalion afterwards

made a forced march towards that place  where it arrived in time to

witness the failure of the attack  the services of the battalion

were afterwards connected with the operations against antwerp  and

preventing supplies of provision and troops joining the garrison 



in the mean time napoleon was pressed on every side by overwhelming

numbers  which he was not able to withstand  and he was forced

to abdicate the throne of france  peace was restored  and the

battalion of the fifty sixth marched into antwerp  from whence it

proceeded to ostend  where it embarked for england in september 

and landing at deal  marched to sheerness 



the army being reduced on the restoration of peace  the third

battalion was disbanded at sheerness on the 24th of october  its

men fit for service being transferred to the first and second

battalions in india  for which country they embarked about three

months afterwards 



the second battalion continued to suffer severely from disease at

the camp at domus  its loss from march 1813  to december 1814 

amounting to three hundred and twenty nine non commissioned

officers and soldiers  the conduct of the men  during this

distressing period  called forth the approbation of the commander

of the district  expressed in division orders  in the strongest

terms  during the year  it proceeded to barachia  subsequently

embarked for bombay  and after occupying the pendals at colabah a

short period  marched into fort george barracks

they remained during the monsoon  and in august marched in three

divisions to seroor  from whence the grenadier and rifle companies

proceeded to poonah under colonel smith  who left lieut  colonel

kingscote in command at seroor  these companies returned in october 



in the mean time occurrences in europe had occasioned the

removal of the first battalion from madras  the sudden return of

bonaparte to france  and the astonishing facility with which he

regained temporary possession of the throne of that kingdom  was

followed by a manifested disposition to revolt on the part of the

french settlers at the mauritius  and the first battalion of the

fifty sixth  which had been joined by three hundred men from the

third  embarked on board the salsette frigate  and the company’s

ships rose and streatham  to reinforce the garrison at that

and each supposed the other lost  but they arrived safe at port

louis  where they were stationed until november  when they marched

the second battalion again took the field with the poonah

subsidiary force  in the early part of 1816  and in may it went

into cantonments at jaulna  from whence lieut  colonel kingscote 

of the fifty sixth  was detached in september  with a light

battalion  comprising part of the regiment  in pursuit of a native

chief  called trimbuckjee dainglia  who had murdered the minister

of state of guzerat  escaped from prison  and was suspected of a

design to assemble a force on the frontiers of the dominions of

his late sovereign  the peishwa  the pursuit of this chieftain

occasioned the soldiers many fatiguing marches  and on one occasion

the fortified village of nimgaum  on the banks of the peera  was

surrounded in the expectation that the chief was there  but when 

on the advance of the artillery  the inhabitants opened the gates 

he could not be found  the pursuit was afterwards discontinued  and

the detachment re joined the poonah subsidiary force at seroor 

whither it had been removed from jaulna in october  at the close of

active operations  colonel lionel smith expressed the high opinion

he entertained of the battalion  in division orders  dated seroor 

31st of october  in the following terms   “there is no language of

praise  or thanks  colonel smith could feel to be too strong in

describing the merits of such a corps ”



in august the first battalion returned to port st  louis  and

about a month afterwards so serious a conflagration occurred at

that place  that the destruction of the town appeared inevitable 

but this calamity was averted by the efforts of the soldiers of

the fifty sixth  who prevented the fire communicating to the

government buildings  and thus saved the town  two men of the

regiment lost their lives  in attempting to arrest the progress

of the flames  the daring conduct of serjeant james hasty was

particularly conspicuous and successful in checking the progress

of the flames  and the governor expressed the following opinion

of his merits in a letter to colonel barclay   “i conscientiously

believe  that it was in a great measure owing to serjeant hasty  of

your regiment  that the whole town of port louis was not swallowed

by the flames  his persevering fortitude and intrepid confidence

enabled him to save the government house  by remaining among the

flames when most others had despaired  and it is universally

allowed  that had the government house been burned  the remainder

of the town must immediately have followed  and the whole

population of port louis left houseless among the smoking ruins 6  ”



the peace of europe appearing to be established upon a sound

foundation  a considerable reduction was made in the strength of

the british army  and the second battalions of regiments were

soldier like in appearance  well appointed  and in no respect

should again call for his excellency’s services in the field  he

will feel happy in having the fifty sixth regiment placed under

in the year 1829  his majesty’s government deemed it necessary to

direct courts of inquiry to be instituted in the several regiments 

in consequence of numerous frauds having been committed by certain

soldiers  who  on being discharged  had given false statements of

their ages  dates of enlistment  and of the periods of their former

services  by which many had obtained undue rates of pension  and

had thus imposed on their commanding officers  and on the bounty of

their sovereign and country 



the court held to investigate the books of the fifty sixth regiment

reported  that the description book had been well kept  and

afforded a practical example of a system which it was proposed to

adopt generally  namely  to give each man on joining a regiment  a

number   to be marked on his attestation  and placed against his

name in the description  and other record books of the regiment 

that the book of the fifty sixth regiment contained nearly two

thousand names  the plan and arrangement of which were highly

creditable to the zeal and industry of colonel barclay  and that

few instances of error  or of fraud  had been detected 



the court concluded their report with a well merited compliment

to colonel barclay  whose long service in the regiment had been

characterized by zeal and attention to his duties  this report

was submitted to the secretary at war  and sir henry hardinge

signified to the general commanding in chief  lord hill  his

cordial concurrence in the observations made by the court  so

highly honourable to colonel barclay  and his lordship directed it

to be announced  that  in the midst of the irregularities which had

been made manifest by the investigations of these courts of inquiry

in the several corps  it was peculiarly gratifying to him to bear

testimony to the successful and unremitting exertions of colonel

barclay  which  while they reflected credit upon him  proved that 

with diligence and a due adherence to regulations  the disreputable

errors and frauds  which had been discovered in other regiments 

could not have been effected 7

service  it was a favourite corps in england  particularly in the

county of surrey  and although many men were lost by casualties

abroad  yet its effectives generally amounted to two thousand rank
