preface





for this anthology i have tried to range over the whole field of english

verse from the beginning  or from the thirteenth century to this closing

year of the nineteenth  and to choose the best  nor have i sought in

these islands only  but wheresoever the muse has followed the tongue

which among living tongues she most delights to honour  to bring home

and render so great a spoil compendiously has been my capital

difficulty  it is for the reader to judge if i have so managed it as to

serve those who already love poetry and to implant that love in some

young minds not yet initiated 



my scheme is simple  i have arranged the poets as nearly as possible in

order of birth  with such groupings of anonymous pieces as seemed

convenient  for convenience  too  as well as to avoid a dispute royal  i

have gathered the most of the ballads into the middle of the seventeenth

century  where they fill a languid interval between two winds of

inspiration  the italian dying down with milton and the french following

at the heels of the restored royalists  for convenience  again  i have

set myself certain rules of spelling  in the very earliest poems

inflection and spelling are structural  and to modernize is to destroy 

but as old inflections fade into modern the old spelling becomes less

and less vital  and has been brought  not  i hope  too abruptly  into

line with that sanctioned by use and familiar  to do this seemed wiser

than to discourage many readers for the sake of diverting others by a

scent of antiquity which  to be essential  should breathe of something

rarer than an odd arrangement of type  but there are scholars whom i

cannot expect to agree with me  and to conciliate them i have excepted

spenser and milton from the rule 



glosses of archaic and otherwise difficult words are given at the foot

of the page  but the text has not been disfigured with reference marks 

and rather than make the book unwieldy i have eschewed

notes  reluctantly when some obscure passage or allusion seemed to ask

for a timely word  with more equanimity when the temptation was to

criticize or ‘appreciate ’ for the function of the anthologist includes

criticizing in silence 



care has been taken with the texts  but i have sometimes thought it

consistent with the aim of the book to prefer the more beautiful to the

better attested reading  i have often excised weak or superfluous

stanzas when sure that excision would improve  and have not hesitated to

extract a few stanzas from a long poem when persuaded that they could

stand alone as a lyric  the apology for such experiments can only lie in

their success  but the risk is one which  in my judgement  the

anthologist ought to take  a few small corrections have been made  but

only when they were quite obvious 



the numbers chosen are either lyrical or epigrammatic  indeed i am

mistaken if a single epigram included fails to preserve at least some

faint thrill of the emotion through which it had to pass before the

muse’s lips let it fall  with however exquisite deliberation  but the

lyrical spirit is volatile and notoriously hard to bind with

definitions  and seems to grow wilder with the years  with the

anthologist  as with the fisherman who knows the fish at the end of his

sea line  the gift  if he have it  comes by sense  improved by practice 

the definition  if he be clever enough to frame one  comes by

after thought  i don’t know that it helps  and am sure that it may

easily mislead 



having set my heart on choosing the best  i resolved not to be dissuaded

by common objections against anthologies  that they repeat one another

until the proverb δὶς ἢ τρὶς τὰ καλά loses all application  or perturbed

if my judgement should often agree with that of good critics  the best

is the best  though a hundred judges have declared it so  nor had it

been any feat to search out and insert the second rate merely because it

happened to be recondite  to be sure  a man must come to such a task as

mine haunted by his youth and the favourites he loved in days when he

had much enthusiasm but little reading 



                a deeper import

    lurks in the legend told my infant years

    than lies upon that truth we live to learn 



few of my contemporaries can erase  or would wish to erase  the dye

their minds took from the late mr  palgrave’s  golden treasury   and he

who has returned to it again and again with an affection born of

companionship on many journeys must remember not only what the  golden

treasury  includes  but the moment when this or that poem appealed to

him  and even how it lies on the page  to mr  bullen’s  lyrics from the

elizabethan song books  and his other treasuries i own a more advised

debt  nor am i free of obligation to anthologies even more recent  to

archbishop trench’s  household book of poetry   mr  locker lampson’s

 lyra elegantiarum   mr  miles’  poets and poetry of the century   mr 

beeching’s  paradise of english poetry   mr  henley’s  english lyrics  

mrs  sharp’s  lyra celtica   mr  yeats’  book of irish verse   and mr 

churton collins’  treasury of minor british poetry   though my rule has

been to consult these after making my own choice  yet i can claim that

the help derived from them  though gratefully owned  bears but a

trifling proportion to the labour  special and desultory  which has gone

to the making of my book 



for the anthologist’s is not quite the  dilettante  business for which

it is too often and ignorantly derided  i say this  and immediately

repent  since my wish is that the reader should in his own pleasure

quite forget the editor’s labour  which too has been pleasant  that 

standing aside  i may believe this book has made the muses’ access

easier when  in the right hour  they come to him to uplift or to

console

    upon this hill i found a tree 

    under a tree a man sitting 

    from head to foot wounded was he 

    his hearte blood i saw bleeding 

    a seemly man to be a king 

    a gracious face to look unto 

    i askèd why he had paining

    my sister  man’s soul  i loved her thus 

    because we would in no wise dissever

    i purveyed her a palace full precious 

    she fled  i followed  i loved her so

    that i suffered this pain piteous

       quia amore langueo  



    my fair love and my spouse bright 

    i saved her from beating  and she hath me bet 

    i clothed her in grace and heavenly light 

    this bloody shirt she hath on me set 

    for longing of love yet would i not let 

    sweete strokes are these  lo 

    i have loved her ever as i her het

       quia amore langueo  



    i crowned her with bliss and she me with thorn 

    i led her to chamber and she me to die 

    i brought her to worship and she me to scorn 

    i did her reverence and she me villany 

    to love that loveth is no maistry 

    her hate made never my love her foe 

    ask me then no question why  

       quia amore langueo  



    look unto mine handes  man 

    these gloves were given me when i her sought

 25    the nut brown maid 



15th cent 



     he    be it right or wrong  these men among 

              on women do complain  

            affirming this  how that it is 

              a labour spent in vain 

            to love them wele  for never a dele 

              they love a man again  

            for let a man do what he can 

              their favour to attain  

            yet if a new to them pursue  

              their first true lover than 

            laboureth for naught  for from her thought 

              he is a banished man  



      25   never a dele  never a bit  than  then 



     she    i say not nay  but that all day 

              it is both written and said 

            that woman’s faith is  as who saith  

              all utterly decayd  

            but nevertheless  right good witnèss 

              in this case might be laid 

            that they love true and continue  

              record the nut brown maid  

            which  when her love came her to prove  

              to her to make his moan  

            would not depart  for in her heart 

              she loved but him alone  



     he    then between us let us discuss 

              what was all the manere 

            between them two  we will also 

              tell all the pain in fere 

            that she was in  now i begin  

              so that ye me answere  

            wherefore all ye that present be  

              i pray you  give an ear  

            i am the knight  i come by night  

              as secret as i can  

            saying   alas  thus standeth the case 

             i am a banished man 



     she    and i your will for to fulfil 

              in this will not refuse  

            trusting to show  in wordes few  

              that men have an ill use   

            to their own shame  women to blame  

              and causeless them accuse  



     in fere  in company together 



            therefore to you i answer now  

              all women to excuse   

           mine own heart dear  with you what cheer 

             i pray you  tell anone 

           for  in my mind  of all mankind

             i love but you alone 



     he   it standeth so  a deed is do

             whereof great harm shall grow 

           my destiny is for to die

             a shameful death  i trow 

           or else to flee  the t’ one must be 

             none other way i know

           but to withdraw as an outlàw 

             and take me to my bow 

           wherefore adieu  mine own heart true 

             none other rede i can 

           for i must to the green wood go 

             alone  a banished man 



     she   o lord  what is this worldis bliss 

             that changeth as the moon 

           my summer’s day in lusty may

             is darked before the noon 

           i hear you say  farewell  nay  nay 

             we dèpart not so soon 

           why say ye so  whither will ye go 

             alas  what have ye done 

           all my welfàre to sorrow and care

             should change  if ye were gone 

           for  in my mind  of all mankind

             i love but you alone 



     rede i can  counsel i know 



     he   i can believe it shall you grieve 

             and somewhat you distrain 

           but afterward  your paines hard

             within a day or twain

           shall soon aslake  and ye shall take

             comfort to you again 

           why should ye ought  for  to make thought 

             your labour were in vain 

           and thus i do  and pray you to 

             as hartely as i can 

           for i must to the green wood go 

             alone  a banished man 



     she   now  sith that ye have showed to me

             the secret of your mind 

           i shall be plain to you again 

             like as ye shall me find 

           sith it is so that ye will go 

             i will not live behind 

           shall never be said the nut brown maid

             was to her love unkind 

           make you readý  for so am i 

             although it were anone 

           for  in my mind  of all mankind

             i love but you alone 



     he   yet i you rede to take good heed

             what men will think and say 

           of young  of old  it shall be told

             that ye be gone away

           your wanton will for to fulfil 

             in green wood you to play 

           and that ye might for your delight

             no longer make delay

           rather than ye should thus for me

             be called an ill womàn

           yet would i to the green wood go 

             alone  a banished man 



     she   though it be sung of old and young

             that i should be to blame 

           theirs be the charge that speak so large

             in hurting of my name 

           for i will prove that faithful love

             it is devoid of shame 

           in your distress and heaviness

             to part with you the same 

           and sure all tho that do not so

             true lovers are they none 

           for in my mind  of all mankind

             i love but you alone 



     he   i counsel you  remember how

             it is no maiden’s law

           nothing to doubt  but to run out

             to wood with an outlàw 

           for ye must there in your hand bear

             a bow readý to draw 

           and as a thief thus must you live

             ever in dread and awe 

           whereby to you great harm might grow 

             yet had i liever than

           that i had to the green wood go 

             alone  a banished man 



     part with  share with  tho  those 



     she   i think not nay but as ye say 

             it is no maiden’s lore 

           but love may make me for your sake 

             as i have said before 

           to come on foot  to hunt and shoot 

             to get us meat and store 

           for so that i your company

             may have  i ask no more 

           from which to part it maketh my heart

             as cold as any stone 

           for  in my mind  of all mankind

             i love but you alone 



     he   for an outlàw this is the law 

             that men him take and bind 

           without pitie  hangèd to be 

             and waver with the wind 

           if i had need  as god forbede  

             what socours could ye find 

           forsooth i trow  you and your bow

             for fear would draw behind 

           and no mervail  for little avail

             were in your counsel than 

           wherefore i’ll to the green wood go 

             alone  a banished man 



     she   right well know ye that women be

             but feeble for to fight 

           no womanhede it is  indeed 

             to be bold as a knight 

           yet in such fear if that ye were

             with enemies day and night 

           i would withstand  with bow in hand 

             to grieve them as i might 

           and you to save  as women have

             from death men many one 

           for  in my mind  of all mankind

             i love but you alone 



     he   yet take good hede  for ever i drede

             that ye could not sustain

           the thorny ways  the deep vallèys 

             the snow  the frost  the rain 

           the cold  the heat  for dry or wete 

             we must lodge on the plain 

           and  us above  no other roof

             but a brake bush or twain 

           which soon should grieve you  i believe 

             and ye would gladly than

           that i had to the green wood go 

             alone  a banished man 



     she   sith i have here been partynere

             with you of joy and bliss 

           i must alsò part of your woe

             endure  as reason is 

           yet i am sure of one pleasùre 

             and shortly it is this  

           that where ye be  me seemeth  pardé 

             i could not fare amiss 

           without more speech i you beseech

             that we were shortly gone 

           for  in my mind  of all mankind

             i love but you alone 





     he   if ye go thyder  ye must consider 

             when ye have lust to dine 

           there shall no meat be for to gete 

             nether bere  ale  ne wine 

           ne shetès clean  to lie between 

             made of thread and twine 

           none other house  but leaves and boughs 

             to cover your head and mine 

           lo  mine heart sweet  this ill diète

             should make you pale and wan 

           wherefore i’ll to the green wood go 

             alone  a banished man 



     she   among the wild deer such an archère 

             as men say that ye be 

           ne may not fail of good vitayle

             where is so great plentè 

           and water clear of the rivere

             shall be full sweet to me 

           with which in hele i shall right wele

             endure  as ye shall see 

           and  or we go  a bed or two

             i can provide anone 

           for  in my mind  of all mankind

             i love but you alone 



     he   lo yet  before  ye must do more 

             if ye will go with me 

           as  cut your hair up by your ear 

             your kirtle by the knee 

           with bow in hand for to withstand

             your enemies  if need be 



     hele  health 



           and this same night  before daylight 

             to woodward will i flee 

           if that ye will all this fulfil 

             do it shortly as ye can

             alone  a banished man 





     she   if ye take heed  it is no need

             such words to say to me 

           for oft ye prayed  and long assayed 

             or i loved you  pardè 

           and though that i of ancestry

             a baron’s daughter be 

           yet have you proved how i you loved 

             a squire of low degree 

           and ever shall  whatso befall

             to die therefore anone 

           for  in my mind  of all mankind

             i love but you alone 



     he   a baron’s child to be beguiled 

             it were a cursèd deed 

           to be felàw with an outlaw  

             almighty god forbede 

           yet better were the poor squyere

             alone to forest yede

           than ye shall say another day

             that by my cursèd rede

           ye were betrayed  wherefore  good maid 

             the best rede that i can 

           is  that i to the green wood go 

             alone  a banished man 



     she   whatever befall  i never shall

             of this thing be upbraid 

           but if ye go  and leave me so 

             then have ye me betrayed 

           remember you wele  how that ye dele 

             for if ye  as ye said 



     yede  went 



           be so unkind to leave behind

             your love  the nut brown maid 

           trust me trulý that i shall die

             soon after ye be gone 

           for  in my mind  of all mankind

             i love but you alone 



     he   if that ye went  ye should repent 

             for in the forest now

           i have purveyed me of a maid

             whom i love more than you 

           another more fair than ever ye were

             i dare it well avow 

           and of you both each should be wroth

             with other  as i trow 

           it were mine ease to live in peace 

             so will i  if i can 

           wherefore i to the wood will go 

             alone  a banished man 



     she   though in the wood i understood

             ye had a paramour 

           all this may nought remove my thought 

             but that i will be your’ 

           and she shall find me soft and kind

             and courteis every hour 

           glad to fulfil all that she will

             command me  to my power 

           for had ye  lo  an hundred mo 

             yet would i be that one 

           for  in my mind  of all mankind

             i love but you alone 





     he   mine own dear love  i see the prove

             that ye be kind and true 

           of maid  of wife  in all my life 

             the best that ever i knew 

           be merry and glad  be no more sad 

             the case is changèd new 

           for it were ruth that for your truth

             ye should have cause to rue 

           be not dismayed  whatsoever i said

             to you when i began 

           i will not to the green wood go 

             i am no banished man 



     she   these tidings be more glad to me

             than to be made a queen 

           if i were sure they should endure 

             but it is often seen

           when men will break promise they speak

             the wordis on the splene 

           ye shape some wile me to beguile 

             and steal from me  i ween 

           then were the case worse than it was 

             and i more wo begone 

           for  in my mind  of all mankind

             i love but you alone 



     he   ye shall not nede further to drede 

             i will not disparàge

           you  god defend   sith you descend

             of so great a linàge 

           now understand  to westmoreland 

             which is my heritage 



     on the splene  that is  in haste 



    i will you bring  and with a ring 

      by way of marriàge

    i will you take  and lady make 

      as shortly as i can 

    thus have you won an earles son 

      and not a banished man 



     here may ye see that women be 

       in love meek  kind  and stable  

     let never man reprove them than  

       or call them variable  

     but rather pray god that we may 

       to them be comfortable  

     which sometime proveth such as he loveth  

       if they be charitable  

     for sith men would that women should 

       be meek to them each one  

     much more ought they to god obey  

       and serve but him alone  





 26    as ye came from the holy land 



16th cent 



    as ye came from the holy land

      of walsinghame 

    met you not with my true love

      by the way as you came 



    how should i know your true love 

      that have met many a one

    as i came from the holy land 

      that have come  that have gone 





    she is neither white nor brown 

      but as the heavens fair 

    there is none hath her form divine

      in the earth or the air 



    such a one did i meet  good sir 

      such an angelic face 

    who like a nymph  like a queen  did appear

      in her gait  in her grace 



    she hath left me here alone

      all alone  as unknown 

    who sometime did me lead with herself 

      and me loved as her own 



    what’s the cause that she leaves you alone

      and a new way doth take 

    that sometime did love you as her own 

      and her joy did you make 



    i have loved her all my youth 

      but now am old  as you see 

    love likes not the falling fruit 

      nor the withered tree 



    know that love is a careless child 

      and forgets promise past 

    he is blind  he is deaf when he list 

      and in faith never fast 



    his desire is a dureless content 

      and a trustless joy 

    he is won with a world of despair 

      and is lost with a toy 



    of womenkind such indeed is the love 

      or the word love abusèd 

    under which many childish desires

      and conceits are excusèd 



    but true love is a durable fire 

      in the mind ever burning 

    never sick  never dead  never cold 

      from itself never turning

    o western wind  when wilt thou blow

      that the small rain down can rain

    balow  my babe  lie still and sleep 

    it grieves me sore to see thee weep 

    wouldst thou be quiet i’se be glad 

    thy mourning makes my sorrow sad 

    balow my boy  thy mother’s joy 

    thy father breeds me great annoy  

                  balow  la low 



    when he began to court my love 

    and with his sugred words me move 

    his faynings false and flattering cheer

    to me that time did not appear 

    but now i see most cruellye

    he cares ne for my babe nor me  

                  balow  la low 



    lie still  my darling  sleep awhile 

    and when thou wak’st thou’le sweetly smile 

    but smile not as thy father did 

    to cozen maids  nay  god forbid 

    but yet i fear thou wilt go near

    thy father’s heart and face to bear  

                  balow  la low 



    i cannot choose but ever will

    be loving to thy father still 

    where’er he go  where’er he ride 

    my love with him doth still abide 

    in weal or woe  where’er he go 

    my heart shall ne’er depart him fro  

                  balow  la low 



    but do not  do not  pretty mine 

    to faynings false thy heart incline 

    be loyal to thy lover true 

    and never change her for a new 

    if good or fair  of her have care

    for women’s banning’s wondrous sare  

                  balow  la low 



    bairn  by thy face i will beware 

    like sirens’ words  i’ll come not near 

    my babe and i together will live 

    he’ll comfort me when cares do grieve 

    my babe and i right soft will lie 

    and ne’er respect man’s crueltye  

                  balow  la low 





    farewell  farewell  the falsest youth

    that ever kist a woman’s mouth 

    i wish all maids be warn’d by me

    never to trust man’s curtesye 

    for if we do but chance to bow 

    they’ll use us then they care not how

16th cent    



           this winter’s weather it waxeth cold 

             and frost it freezeth on every hill 

           and boreas blows his blast so bold

             that all our cattle are like to spill 

           bell  my wife  she loves no strife 

             she said unto me quietlye 

           rise up  and save cow crumbock’s life 

             man  put thine old cloak about thee 



     he   o bell my wife  why dost thou flyte 

             thou kens my cloak is very thin 

           it is so bare and over worn 

             a crickè thereon cannot renn 

           then i’ll no longer borrow nor lend 

             for once i’ll new apparell’d be 

           to morrow i’ll to town and spend 

             for i’ll have a new cloak about me 



     she   cow crumbock is a very good cow 

             she has been always true to the pail 

           she has helped us to butter and cheese  i trow 

             and other things she will not fail 



      29   flyte  scold 



           i would be loth to see her pine 

               good husband  counsel take of me 

           it is not for us to go so fine  

               man  take thine old cloak about thee 



     he   my cloak it was a very good cloak 

             it hath been always true to the wear 

           but now it is not worth a groat 

             i have had it four and forty year’ 

           sometime it was of cloth in grain 

             ’tis now but a sigh clout  as you may see 

           it will neither hold out wind nor rain 

             and i’ll have a new cloak about me 



     she   it is four and forty years ago

             sine the one of us the other did ken 

           and we have had  betwixt us two 

             of children either nine or ten 

           we have brought them up to women and men 

             in the fear of god i trow they be 

           and why wilt thou thyself misken 

             man  take thine old cloak about thee 



     he   o bell my wife  why dost thou flyte 

             now is now  and then was then 

           seek now all the world throughout 

             thou kens not clowns from gentlemen 

           they are clad in black  green  yellow and blue 

             so far above their own degree 

           once in my life i’ll take a view 

             for i’ll have a new cloak about me 



     cloth in grain  scarlet cloth  sigh clout  a rag for straining 



     she   king stephen was a worthy peer 

             his breeches cost him but a crown 

           he held them sixpence all too dear 

             therefore he called the tailor ‘lown ’

           he was a king and wore the crown 

             and thou’se but of a low degree 

           it’s pride that puts this country down

     he   bell my wife  she loves not strife 

             yet she will lead me  if she can 

           and to maintain an easy life

             i oft must yield  though i’m good man 

           it’s not for a man with a woman to threap 

             unless he first give o’er the plea 

           as we began  so will we keep 

             and i’ll take my old cloak about me

 37    vixi puellis nuper idoneus     



    they flee from me that sometime did me seek 

      with naked foot stalking within my chamber 

    once have i seen them gentle  tame  and meek 

      that now are wild  and do not once remember

      that sometime they have put themselves in danger

    to take bread at my hand  and now they range 

    busily seeking in continual change 



    thanked be fortune  it hath been otherwise

      twenty times better  but once especial  

    in thin array  after a pleasant guise 

      when her loose gown did from her shoulders fall 

      and she me caught in her arms long and small 

    and therewithal so sweetly did me kiss 

    and softly said  ‘ dear heart  how like you this  ’



    it was no dream  for i lay broad awaking 

      but all is turn’d now  through my gentleness 

    into a bitter fashion of forsaking 

      and i have leave to go of her goodness 

      and she also to use new fangleness 

    but since that i unkindly so am servèd 

    ‘ how like you this  ’  what hath she now deservèd

      my lute  be still  for i have done 



    as to be heard where ear is none 

    as lead to grave in marble stone 

      my song may pierce her heart as soon 

    should we then sing  or sigh  or moan 

      no  no  my lute  for i have done 



    the rocks do not so cruelly

    repulse the waves continually 

      as she my suit and affectiòn 

    so that i am past remedy 

      whereby my lute and i have done 



    proud of the spoil that thou hast got

    of simple hearts thorough love’s shot 

      by whom  unkind  thou hast them won 

    think not he hath his bow forgot 

      although my lute and i have done 



    vengeance shall fall on thy disdain

      although my lute and i have done 





    may chance thee lie wither’d and old

    the winter nights that are so cold 

      plaining in vain unto the moon 

    thy wishes then dare not be told 

      care then who list  for i have done 



    and then may chance thee to repent

    the time that thou has lost and spent

      to cause thy lover’s sigh and swoon 

    then shalt thou know beauty but lent 

      and wish and want as i have done 



    now cease  my lute  this is the last

    labour that thou and i shall waste 

      and ended is that we begun 

    now is this song both sung and past  

      my lute  be still  for i have done

 39    description of spring 



 wherein each thing renews  save only the lover 



    the soote season  that bud and bloom forth brings 

    with green hath clad the hill and eke the vale 

    the nightingale with feathers new she sings 

    the turtle to her make hath told her tale 

    summer is come  for every spray now springs 

    the hart hath hung his old head on the pale 

    the buck in brake his winter coat he flings 

    the fishes flete with new repairèd scale 



      39   make  mate 



    the adder all her slough away she slings 

    the swift swallow pursueth the flies smale 

    the busy bee her honey now she mings 

    winter is worn that was the flowers’ bale 



    and thus i see among these pleasant things

    each care decays  and yet my sorrow springs 



      39   mings  mingles  mixes 





 40    complaint of the absence of her lover being upon the sea 



    o happy dames  that may embrace

      the fruit of your delight 

    help to bewail the woful case

      and eke the heavy plight

    of me  that wonted to rejoice

    the fortune of my pleasant choice 

    good ladies  help to fill my mourning voice 



    in ship  freight with rememberance

      of thoughts and pleasures past 

    he sails that hath in governance

      my life while it will last 

    with scalding sighs  for lack of gale 

    furthering his hope  that is his sail 

    toward me  the swete port of his avail 



    alas  how oft in dreams i see

      those eyes that were my food 

    which sometime so delighted me 

      that yet they do me good 

    wherewith i wake with his return

    whose absent flame did make me burn 

    but when i find the lack  lord  how i mourn 



    when other lovers in arms across

      rejoice their chief delight 

    drownèd in tears  to mourn my loss

      i stand the bitter night

    in my window where i may see

    before the winds how the clouds flee 

    lo  what a mariner love hath made me 



    and in green waves when the salt flood

      doth rise by rage of wind 

    a thousand fancies in that mood

      assail my restless mind 

    alas  now drencheth my sweet foe 

    that with the spoil of my heart did go 

    and left me  but alas  why did he so 



    and when the seas wax calm again

      to chase fro me annoy 

    my doubtful hope doth cause me plain 

      so dread cuts off my joy 

    thus is my wealth mingled with woe

    and of each thought a doubt doth grow 

      now he comes  will he come  alas  no  no 



      40   drencheth  i e  is drenched or drowned 





 41    the means to attain happy life 



    martial  the things that do attain

    the happy life be these  i find   

    the richesse left  not got with pain 

      the fruitful ground  the quiet mind 

    the equal friend  no grudge  no strife 

      no charge of rule  nor governance 

    without disease  the healthful life 

      the household of continuance 



    the mean diet  no delicate fare 

      true wisdom join’d with simpleness 

    the night dischargèd of all care 

      where wine the wit may not oppress 



    the faithful wife  without debate 

      such sleeps as may beguile the night 

    contented with thine own estate

      ne wish for death  ne fear his might

 42    a true love 



    what sweet relief the showers to thirsty plants we see 

    what dear delight the blooms to bees  my true love is to me 

    as fresh and lusty ver foul winter doth exceed  

    as morning bright  with scarlet sky  doth pass the evening’s weed  

    as mellow pears above the crabs esteemèd be  

    so doth my love surmount them all  whom yet i hap to see 

    the oak shall olives bear  the lamb the lion fray 

    the owl shall match the nightingale in tuning of her lay 



      42   fray  affright 



    or i my love let slip out of mine entire heart 

    so deep reposèd in my breast is she for her desart 

    for many blessèd gifts  o happy  happy land 

    where mars and pallas strive to make their glory most to stand 

    yet  land  more is thy bliss that  in this cruel age 

    a venus’ imp thou hast brought forth  so steadfast and so sage 

    among the muses nine a tenth if jove would make 

    and to the graces three a fourth  her would apollo take 

    let some for honour hunt  and hoard the massy gold 

    with her so i may live and die  my weal cannot be told

    lo  quhat it is to love

      learn ye that list to prove 

    by me  i say  that no ways may

      the ground of grief remove 

    but still decay both nicht and day 

      lo  quhat it is to love 



      love is ane fervent fire

      kindlit without desire 

    short pleasure  long displeasure 

      repentance is the hire 

    ane pure tressour without measour 

      love is ane fervent fire 



      to love and to be wise 

      to rage with good advice 

    now thus  now than  so gois the game 

      incertain is the dice 

    there is no man  i say  that can

      both love and to be wise 



      flee always from the snare 

      learn at me to beware 

    it is ane pain  and double trane

      of endless woe and care 

    for to refrain that danger plain 

      flee always from the snare

    in a harbour grene aslepe whereas i lay 

    the byrdes sang swete in the middes of the day 

    i dreamèd fast of mirth and play 

        in youth is pleasure  in youth is pleasure 



    methought i walked still to and fro 

    and from her company i could not go  

    but when i waked it was not so 

        in youth is pleasure  in youth is pleasure 



    therefore my hart is surely pyght

    of her alone to have a sight

    which is my joy and hartes delight 

        in youth is pleasure  in youth is pleasure

 46    amantium iræ 



    in going to my naked bed as one that would have slept 

    i heard a wife sing to her child  that long before had wept 

    she sighèd sore and sang full sweet  to bring the babe to rest 

    that would not cease but crièd still  in sucking at her breast 

    she was full weary of her watch  and grievèd with her child 

    she rockèd it and rated it  till that on her it smiled 

    then did she say  now have i found this proverb true to prove 

    the falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love 



    then took i paper  pen  and ink  this proverb for to write 

    in register for to remain of such a worthy wight 

    as she proceeded thus in song unto her little brat 

    much matter utter’d she of weight  in place whereas she sat 

    and provèd plain there was no beast  nor creature bearing life 

    could well be known to live in love without discord and strife 

    then kissèd she her little babe  and sware by god above 

    the falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love 



    she said that neither king nor prince nor lord could live aright 

    until their puissance they did prove  their manhood and their might 

    when manhood shall be matched so that fear can take no place 

    then weary works make warriors each other to embrace 

    and left their force that failèd them  which did consume the rout 

    that might before have lived their time  their strength and nature out 

    then did she sing as one that thought no man could her reprove 

    the falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love 



    she said she saw no fish nor fowl  nor beast within her haunt 

    that met a stranger in their kind  but could give it a taunt 

    since flesh might not endure  but rest must wrath succeed 

    and force the fight to fall to play in pasture where they feed 

    so noble nature can well end the work she hath begun 

    and bridle well that will not cease her tragedy in some 

    thus in song she oft rehearsed  as did her well behove 

    the falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love 



    i marvel much pardy  quoth she  for to behold the rout 

    to see man  woman  boy and beast  to toss the world about 

    some kneel  some crouch  some beck  some check  and some can smoothly smile 

    and some embrace others in arm  and there think many a wile 

    some stand aloof at cap and knee  some humble and some stout 

    yet are they never friends in deed until they once fall out 

    thus ended she her song and said  before she did remove 

    the falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love

 47    a lover’s lullaby 



    sing lullaby  as women do 

      wherewith they bring their babes to rest 

    and lullaby can i sing too 

      as womanly as can the best 

    with lullaby they still the child 

    and if i be not much beguiled 

    full many a wanton babe have i 

    which must be still’d with lullaby 



    first lullaby my youthful years 

      it is now time to go to bed 

    for crookèd age and hoary hairs

      have won the haven within my head 

    with lullaby  then  youth be still 

    with lullaby content thy will 

    since courage quails and comes behind 

    go sleep  and so beguile thy mind 



    next lullaby my gazing eyes 

      which wonted were to glance apace 

    for every glass may now suffice

      to show the furrows in thy face 

    with lullaby then wink awhile 

    with lullaby your looks beguile 

    let no fair face  nor beauty bright 

    entice you eft with vain delight 



    and lullaby my wanton will 

      let reason’s rule now reign thy thought 

    since all too late i find by skill

      how dear i have thy fancies bought 

    with lullaby now take thine ease 

    with lullaby thy doubts appease 

    for trust to this  if thou be still 

    my body shall obey thy will 



    thus lullaby my youth  mine eyes 

      my will  my ware  and all that was 

    i can no more delays devise 

      but welcome pain  let pleasure pass 

    with lullaby now take your leave 

    with lullaby your dreams deceive 

    and when you rise with waking eye 

    remember then this lullaby

    for here at hand approacheth one

      whose face will stain you all 



    the virtue of her lively looks

      excels the precious stone 

    i wish to have none other books

      to read or look upon 



    in each of her two crystal eyes

    it would you all in heart suffice

      in troth penelopey 

    in word and eke in deed steadfast 

      what will you more we say 



    if all the world were sought so far 

      who could find such a wight 

    her beauty twinkleth like a star

      within the frosty night 



    her rosial colour comes and goes

      with such a comely grace 

    more ruddier  too  than doth the rose 

      within her lively face 



    at bacchus’ feast none shall her meet 

      ne at no wanton play 

    nor gazing in an open street 

      nor gadding as a stray 



    the modest mirth that she doth use

      is mix’d with shamefastness 

    all vice she doth wholly refuse 

      and hateth idleness 



    o lord  it is a world to see

      how virtue can repair 

    and deck in her such honesty 

      whom nature made so fair 



    truly she doth so far exceed

      our women nowadays 

    as doth the jeliflower a weed 

      and more a thousand ways 





    how might i do to get a graff

      of this unspotted tree 

      for all the rest are plain but chaff 

      which seem good corn to be 



    this gift alone i shall her give 

      when death doth what he can 

    her honest fame shall ever live

      within the mouth of man

 54    to her sea faring lover 



tottel’s miscellany  1557



      shall i thus ever long  and be no whit the neare 

        and shall i still complain to thee  the which me will not hear 

      alas  say nay  say nay  and be no more so dumb 

    but open thou thy manly mouth and say that thou wilt come 

      whereby my heart may think  although i see not thee 

    that thou wilt come  thy word so sware  if thou a live man be 

      the roaring hugy waves they threaten my poor ghost 

    and toss thee up and down the seas in danger to be lost 

      shall they not make me fear that they have swallowed thee 

      but as thou art most sure alive  so wilt thou come to me 

      whereby i shall go see thy ship ride on the strand 

    and think and say  lo where he comes  and  sure here will he land  



      54   neare  nearer 



      and then i shall lift up to thee my little hand 

    and thou shalt think thine heart in ease  in health to see me stand 

      and if thou come indeed  as christ thee send to do  

    those arms which miss thee now shall then embrace  and hold  thee too 

      each vein to every joint the lively blood shall spread

    which now for want of thy glad sight doth show full pale and dead 

      but if thou slip thy troth  and do not come at all 

    as minutes in the clock do strike so call for death i shall 

      to please both thy false heart and rid myself from woe 

    that rather had to die in troth than live forsaken so

      sitting beside a crystal fountain

    adieu  love  adieu  love  untrue love 

    untrue love  untrue love  adieu  love 

    your mind is light  soon lost for new love 



    so long as i was in your sight

      i was your heart  your soul  your treasure 

    and evermore you sobb’d and sigh’d

      burning in flames beyond all measure 

         three days endured your love to me 

          and it was lost in other three 

    adieu  love  adieu  love  untrue love

    another shepherd you did see 

      to whom your heart was soon enchainèd 

    full soon your love was leapt from me 

      full soon my place he had obtainèd 

        soon came a third your love to win 

        and we were out and he was in 

    adieu  love  adieu  love  untrue love 

    untrue love  untrue love  adieu  love 

    your mind is light  soon lost for new love 



    sure you have made me passing glad

      that you your mind so soon removèd 

    before that i the leisure had

      to choose you for my best belovèd 

          for all my love was pass’d and done

          two days before it was begun 

    adieu  love  adieu  love  untrue love

    cannot live together 

    youth is full of pleasance 

    age is full of care 

    youth like summer morn 

    age like winter weather 

    youth like summer brave 

    age like winter bare 

    youth is full of sport 

    age’s breath is short 

    youth is nimble  age is lame 

    youth is hot and bold 

    age is weak and cold 

    youth is wild  and age is tame 

    age  i do abhor thee 

    youth  i do adore thee 

    o  my love  my love is young 

    age  i do defy thee 

    o  sweet shepherd  hie thee

    yet if his majesty  our sovereign lord 

    should of his own accord

    friendly himself invite 

    and say ‘i’ll be your guest to morrow night ’

    how should we stir ourselves  call and command

    all hands to work  ‘let no man idle stand 



    ‘set me fine spanish tables in the hall 

    see they be fitted all 

    let there be room to eat

    and order taken that there want no meat 

    see every sconce and candlestick made bright 

    that without tapers they may give a light 



    ‘look to the presence  are the carpets spread 

    the dazie o’er the head 

    the cushions in the chairs 

    and all the candles lighted on the stairs 

    perfume the chambers  and in any case

    let each man give attendance in his place ’



    thus  if a king were coming  would we do 

    and ’twere good reason too 

    for ’tis a duteous thing

    to show all honour to an earthly king 

    and after all our travail and our cost 

    so he be pleased  to think no labour lost 



    but at the coming of the king of heaven

    all’s set at six and seven 

    we wallow in our sin

    o happy harbour of the saints 

      o sweet and pleasant soil

      thy bulwarks diamonds square 

    thy gates are of right orient pearl

    there grows such sweet and pleasant flowers

      as nowhere else are seen 



    quite through the streets  with silver sound 

      the flood of life doth flow 

    upon whose banks on every side

      the wood of life doth grow 



    there trees for evermore bear fruit 

      and evermore do spring 

    there evermore the angels sit 

      and evermore do sing

      with tones surpassing sweet 

    and all the virgins bear their part

    far from base earth  but not to mount too high 

          for true pleasure

          lives in measure 

          which if men forsake 

    blinded they into folly run and grief for pleasure take 



    but my vain hopes  proud of their new taught flight 

    enamour’d sought to woo the sun’s fair light 

          whose rich brightness

          moved their lightness

          to aspire so high

    that all scorch’d and consumed with fire now drown’d in woe they lie 



    and none but love their woeful hap did rue 

    for love did know that their desires were true 

          though fate frownèd 

          and now drownèd

          they in sorrow dwell

    my love in her attire doth show her wit 

      it doth so well become her 

    for every season she hath dressings fit 

      for winter  spring  and summer 

        no beauty she doth miss

          when all her robes are on 

        but beauty’s self she is

          when all her robes are gone 



 64    how can the heart forget her  



davison’s  poetical rhapsody   1602



    at her fair hands how have i grace entreated

    with prayers oft repeated 

    yet still my love is thwarted 

    heart  let her go  for she’ll not be converted  

                say  shall she go 

                o no  no  no  no  no 

    she is most fair  though she be marble hearted 



    how often have my sighs declared my anguish 

    wherein i daily languish 

    yet still she doth procure it 

    heart  let her go  for i can not endure it  

                say  shall she go 

                o no  no  no  no  no 

    she gave the wound  and she alone must cure it 



    but shall i still a true affection owe her 

    which prayers  sighs  tears do show her 

    and shall she still disdain me 

    heart  let her go  if they no grace can gain me  

                say  shall she go 

                o no  no  no  no  no 

    she made me hers  and hers she will retain me 



    but if the love that hath and still doth burn me

    no love at length return me 

    out of my thoughts i’ll set her 

    heart  let her go  o heart i pray thee  let her 

                say  shall she go 

                o no  no  no  no  no

    look how the snowy mountains

      heaven’s sun doth gently waste

    i saw my lady weep 

      and sorrow proud to be advancèd so

    in those fair eyes where all perfections keep 

      her face was full of woe 

    but such a woe  believe me  as wins more hearts

    than mirth can do with her enticing parts 



        sorrow was there made fair 

    and passion wise  tears a delightful thing 

    silence beyond all speech  a wisdom rare 

        she made her sighs to sing 

    and all things with so sweet a sadness move

    as made my heart at once both grieve  and love 



        o fairer than aught else

    the world can show  leave off in time to grieve 

    enough  enough  your joyful look excels 

        tears kill the heart  believe 

    o strive not to be excellent in woe 

    which only breeds your beauty’s overthrow

    since first i saw your face i resolved to honour and renown ye 

    if now i be disdainèd i wish my heart had never known ye 

    what  i that loved and you that liked  shall we begin to wrangle 

    no  no  no  my heart is fast  and cannot disentangle 



    if i admire or praise you too much  that fault you may forgive me 

    or if my hands had stray’d but a touch  then justly might you leave me 

    i ask’d you leave  you bade me love  is’t now a time to chide me 

    no  no  no  i’ll love you still what fortune e’er betide me 



    the sun  whose beams most glorious are  rejecteth no beholder 

    and your sweet beauty past compare made my poor eyes the bolder 

    where beauty moves and wit delights and signs of kindness bind me

    with that the shepherd waked from sleeping 

    and spying where the day was peeping 

    he said  ‘now take my soul in keeping 

                          my sweetest dear 

    kiss me and take my soul in keeping 

    since i must go  now day is near ’

 73    phillida and coridon 



    in the merry month of may 

    in a morn by break of day 

    forth i walk’d by the wood side

    when as may was in his pride 

    there i spièd all alone

    phillida and coridon 

    much ado there was  god wot 

    he would love and she would not 

    she said  never man was true 

    he said  none was false to you 

    he said  he had loved her long 

    she said  love should have no wrong 

    coridon would kiss her then 

    she said  maids must kiss no men

    till they did for good and all 

    then she made the shepherd call

    all the heavens to witness truth

    never loved a truer youth 

    thus with many a pretty oath 

    yea and nay  and faith and troth 

    such as silly shepherds use

    when they will not love abuse 

    love  which had been long deluded 

    was with kisses sweet concluded 

    and phillida  with garlands gay 

    was made the lady of the may

devices   1593 4



    come little babe  come silly soul 

    thy father’s shame  thy mother’s grief 

    born as i doubt to all our dole 

    and to thyself unhappy chief 

        sing lullaby  and lap it warm 

        poor soul that thinks no creature harm 



    thou little think’st and less dost know

    the cause of this thy mother’s moan 

    thou want’st the wit to wail her woe 

    and i myself am all alone 

        why dost thou weep  why dost thou wail 

        and know’st not yet what thou dost ail 



    come  little wretch  ah  silly heart 

    mine only joy  what can i more 

    if there be any wrong thy smart 

    that may the destinies implore 

        ’twas i  i say  against my will 

        i wail the time  but be thou still 



    and dost thou smile  o  thy sweet face 

    would god himself he might thee see   

    no doubt thou wouldst soon purchase grace 

    i know right well  for thee and me 

        but come to mother  babe  and play 

        for father false is fled away 



    sweet boy  if it by fortune chance

    thy father home again to send 

    if death do strike me with his lance 

    yet mayst thou me to him commend 

        if any ask thy mother’s name 

        tell how by love she purchased blame 



    then will his gentle heart soon yield 

    i know him of a noble mind 

    although a lion in the field 

    a lamb in town thou shalt him find 

        ask blessing  babe  be not afraid 

        his sugar’d words hath me betray’d 



    then mayst thou joy and be right glad 

    although in woe i seem to moan 

    thy father is no rascal lad 

    a noble youth of blood and bone 

        his glancing looks  if he once smile 

        right honest women may beguile 



    come  little boy  and rock asleep 

    sing lullaby and be thou still 

    i  that can do naught else but weep 

    will sit by thee and wail my fill 

        god bless my babe  and lullaby

        from this thy father’s quality

 the silent lover 





 75    i 



    passions are liken’d best to floods and streams 

      the shallow murmur  but the deep are dumb 

    so  when affection yields discourse  it seems

      the bottom is but shallow whence they come 

    they that are rich in words  in words discover

    that they are poor in that which makes a lover 





 76    ii 



    wrong not  sweet empress of my heart 

      the merit of true passion 

    with thinking that he feels no smart 

      that sues for no compassion 



    silence in love bewrays more woe

      than words  though ne’er so witty 

    a beggar that is dumb  you know 

      may challenge double pity 



    then wrong not  dearest to my heart 

      my true  though secret passion 

    he smarteth most that hides his smart 

      and sues for no compassion 





 77    his pilgrimage 



    give me my scallop shell of quiet 

      my staff of faith to walk upon 

    my scrip of joy  immortal diet 

      my bottle of salvation 

    my gown of glory  hope’s true gage 

    and thus i’ll take my pilgrimage 



    blood must be my body’s balmer 

      no other balm will there be given 

    whilst my soul  like quiet palmer 

      travelleth towards the land of heaven 

    over the silver mountains 

    where spring the nectar fountains 

          there will i kiss

          the bowl of bliss 

        and drink mine everlasting fill

        upon every milken hill 

        my soul will be a dry before 

        but  after  it will thirst no more 





 78    the conclusion 



    even such is time  that takes in trust

      our youth  our joys  our all we have 

    and pays us but with earth and dust 

      who in the dark and silent grave 

    when we have wander’d all our ways 

    shuts up the story of our days 

    but from this earth  this grave  this dust 

    my god shall raise me up  i trust

 81    prothalamion 



    calme was the day  and through the trembling ayre

    sweete breathing zephyrus did softly play

    a gentle spirit  that lightly did delay

    hot titans beames  which then did glyster fayre 

    when i   whom sullein care 

    through discontent of my long fruitlesse stay

    in princes court  and expectation vayne

    of idle hopes  which still doe fly away 

    like empty shaddowes  did afflict my brayne  

    walkt forth to ease my payne

    along the shoare of silver streaming themmes 

    whose rutty bancke  the which his river hemmes 

    was paynted all with variable flowers 

    and all the meades adornd with daintie gemmes

    fit to decke maydens bowres 

    and crowne their paramours

    against the brydale day  which is not long 

      sweete themmes  runne softly  till i end my song 



    there  in a meadow  by the rivers side 

    a flocke of nymphes i chauncèd to espy 

    all lovely daughters of the flood thereby 

    with goodly greenish locks  all loose untyde 

    as each had bene a bryde 

    and each one had a little wicker basket 

    made of fine twigs  entraylèd curiously 

    in which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket 

    and with fine fingers cropt full feateously

    the tender stalkes on hye 

    of every sort  which in that meadow grew 

    they gathered some  the violet  pallid blew 



    the little dazie  that at evening closes 

    the virgin lillie  and the primrose trew 

    with store of vermeil roses 

    to decke their bridegromes posies

    against the brydale day  which was not long 

      sweete themmes  runne softly  till i end my song 



    with that i saw two swannes of goodly hewe

    come softly swimming downe along the lee 

    two fairer birds i yet did never see 

    the snow  which doth the top of pindus strew 

    did never whiter shew 

    nor jove himselfe  when he a swan would be 

    for love of leda  whiter did appeare 

    yet leda was  they say  as white as he 

    yet not so white as these  nor nothing neare 

    so purely white they were 

    that even the gentle streame  the which them bare 

    seem’d foule to them  and bad his billowes spare

    to wet their silken feathers  least they might

    soyle their fayre plumes with water not so fayre 

    and marre their beauties bright 

    that shone as heavens light 

    against their brydale day  which was not long 

      sweete themmes  runne softly  till i end my song 

    eftsoones the nymphes  which now had flowers their fill 

    ran all in haste to see that silver brood 

    as they came floating on the christal flood 

    whom when they sawe  they stood amazèd still 

    their wondring eyes to fill 

    them seem’d they never saw a sight so fayre 

    of fowles  so lovely  that they sure did deeme

    them heavenly borne  or to be that same payre

    which through the skie draw venus silver teeme 

    for sure they did not seeme

    to be begot of any earthly seede 

    but rather angels  or of angels breede 

    yet were they bred of somers heat  they say 

    in sweetest season  when each flower and weede

    the earth did fresh aray 

    so fresh they seem’d as day 

    even as their brydale day  which was not long 

      sweete themmes  runne softly  till i end my song 



    then forth they all out of their baskets drew

    great store of flowers  the honour of the field 

    that to the sense did fragrant odours yield 

    all which upon those goodly birds they threw

    and all the waves did strew 

    that like old peneus waters they did seeme 

    when downe along by pleasant tempes shore 

    scattred with flowres  through thessaly they streeme 

    that they appeare  through lillies plenteous store 

    like a brydes chamber flore 

    two of those nymphes  meane while  two garlands bound

    of freshest flowres which in that mead they found 

    the which presenting all in trim array 

    their snowie foreheads therewithall they crownd 

    whil’st one did sing this lay 

    prepared against that day 

    against their brydale day  which was not long 

      sweete themmes  runne softly  till i end my song 



    ‘ye gentle birdes  the worlds faire ornament 

    and heavens glorie  whom this happie hower

    doth leade unto your lovers blisfull bower 

    joy may you have  and gentle hearts content

    of your loves couplement 

    and let faire venus  that is queene of love 

    with her heart quelling sonne upon you smile 

    whose smile  they say  hath vertue to remove

    all loves dislike  and friendships faultie guile

    for ever to assoile 

    let endlesse peace your steadfast hearts accord 

    and blessèd plentie wait upon your bord 

    and let your bed with pleasures chast abound 

    that fruitfull issue may to you afford 

    which may your foes confound 

    and make your joyes redound

    upon your brydale day  which is not long 

      sweete themmes  runne softlie  till i end my song ’



    so ended she  and all the rest around

    to her redoubled that her undersong 

    which said their brydale daye should not be long 

    and gentle eccho from the neighbour ground

    their accents did resound 

    so forth those joyous birdes did passe along 

    adowne the lee  that to them murmurde low 

    as he would speake  but that he lackt a tong 

    yet did by signes his glad affection show 

    making his streame run slow 

    and all the foule which in his flood did dwell

    gan flock about these twaine  that did excell

    the rest  so far as cynthia doth shend

    the lesser starres  so they  enrangèd well 

    did on those two attend 

    and their best service lend

    against their wedding day  which was not long 

      sweete themmes  runne softly  till i end my song 





    at length they all to mery london came 

    to mery london  my most kyndly nurse 

    that to me gave this lifes first native sourse 

    though from another place i take my name 

    an house of auncient fame 

    there when they came  whereas those bricky towres

    the which on themmes brode agèd backe doe ryde 

    where now the studious lawyers have their bowers 

    there whylome wont the templer knights to byde 

    till they decayd through pride 

    next whereunto there standes a stately place 

    where oft i gaynèd giftes and goodly grace

    of that great lord  which therein wont to dwell 

    whose want too well now feeles my freendles case 

    but ah  here fits not well

    olde woes  but joyes  to tell

    against the brydale daye  which is not long 

      sweete themmes  runne softly  till i end my song 



    yet therein now doth lodge a noble peer 

    great englands glory  and the worlds wide wonder 

    whose dreadfull name late through all spaine did thunder 

    and hercules two pillors standing neere

    did make to quake and feare 

    faire branch of honor  flower of chevalrie 

    that fillest england with thy triumphes fame 

    joy have thou of thy noble victorie 

    and endlesse happinesse of thine owne name

    that promiseth the same 

    that through thy prowesse  and victorious armes 

    thy country may be freed from forraine harmes 

    and great elisaes glorious name may ring

    through al the world  fil’d with thy wide alarmes 

    which some brave muse may sing

    to ages following 

    upon the brydale day  which is not long 

      sweete themmes  runne softly till i end my song 



    from those high towers this noble lord issuing 

    like radiant hesper  when his golden hayre

    in th’ ocean billowes he hath bathèd fayre 

    descended to the rivers open vewing 

    with a great traine ensuing 

    above the rest were goodly to bee seene

    two gentle knights of lovely face and feature 

    beseeming well the bower of anie queene 

    with gifts of wit  and ornaments of nature 

    fit for so goodly stature 

    that like the twins of jove they seem’d in sight 

    which decke the bauldricke of the heavens bright 

    they two  forth pacing to the rivers side 

    received those two faire brides  their loves delight 

    which  at th’ appointed tyde 

    each one did make his bryde

    against their brydale day  which is not long 

      sweete themmes  runne softly  till i end my song

    to heare theyr names sung in your simple layes 

    but joyèd in theyr praise 

    and when ye list your owne mishaps to mourne 

    which death  or love  or fortunes wreck did rayse 

    your string could soone to sadder tenor turne 

    and teach the woods and waters to lament

    your dolefull dreriment 

    now lay those sorrowfull complaints aside 

    and  having all your heads with girlands crownd 

    helpe me mine owne loves prayses to resound

    for my fayre love  of lillyes and of roses 

    bound truelove wize  with a blew silke riband 

    and let them make great store of bridale poses 

    and let them eeke bring store of other flowers 

    to deck the bridale bowers 

    and let the ground whereas her foot shall tread 

    for feare the stones her tender foot should wrong 

    be strewed with fragrant flowers all along 

    and diapred lyke the discolored mead 

    which done  doe at her chamber dore awayt 

    for she will waken strayt 

    the whiles doe ye this song unto her sing 

    the woods shall to you answer  and your eccho ring 



    ye nymphes of mulla  which with carefull heed

    the silver scaly trouts doe tend full well 

    and greedy pikes which use therein to feed 

     those trouts and pikes all others doo excell  

    and ye likewise  which keepe the rushy lake

    wake now  my love  awake  for it is time 

    the rosy morne long since left tithones bed 

    all ready to her silver coche to clyme

    her beauty to disgrace 

    o fayrest phœbus  father of the muse 

    if ever i did honour thee aright 

    or sing the thing that mote thy mind delight 

    doe not thy servants simple boone refuse 

    but let this day  let this one day  be myne 

    let all the rest be thine 

    then i thy soverayne prayses loud wil sing 

    that all the woods shal answer  and theyr eccho ring 



    harke  how the minstrils gin to shrill aloud

    their merry musick that resounds from far 

    the pipe  the tabor  and the trembling croud 

    that well agree withouten breach or jar 



     croud  violin 



    but  most of all  the damzels doe delite

    when they their tymbrels smyte 

    and thereunto doe daunce and carrol sweet 

    that all the sences they doe ravish quite 

    the whyles the boyes run up and downe the street 

    crying aloud with strong confusèd noyce 

    as if it were one voyce 

    hymen  iö hymen  hymen  they do shout 

    that even to the heavens theyr shouting shrill

    doth reach  and all the firmament doth fill 

    to which the people standing all about 

    as in approvance  doe thereto applaud 

    and loud advaunce her laud 

    and evermore they hymen  hymen sing 

    that al the woods them answer  and theyr eccho ring 



    loe  where she comes along with portly pace 

    lyke phœbe  from her chamber of the east 

    arysing forth to run her mighty race 

    clad all in white  that seemes a virgin best 

    so well it her beseemes  that ye would weene

    some angell she had beene 

    her long loose yellow locks lyke golden wyre 

    sprinckled with perle  and perling flowres atweene 

    doe lyke a golden mantle her attyre 

    and  being crownèd with a girland greene 

    seeme lyke some mayden queene 

    her modest eyes  abashèd to behold

    so many gazers as on her do stare 

    upon the lowly ground affixèd are 

    ne dare lift up her countenance too bold 

    but blush to heare her prayses sung so loud 

    so farre from being proud 

    nathlesse doe ye still loud her prayses sing 

    that all the woods may answer  and your eccho ring 



    tell me  ye merchants daughters  did ye see

    so fayre a creature in your towne before 

    so sweet  so lovely  and so mild as she 

    adornd with beautyes grace and vertues store 

    her goodly eyes lyke saphyres shining bright 

    her forehead yvory white 

    her cheekes lyke apples which the sun hath rudded 

    her lips lyke cherryes charming men to byte 

    her brest like to a bowle of creame uncrudded 

    her paps lyke lyllies budded 

    her snowie necke lyke to a marble towre 

    and all her body like a pallace fayre 

    ascending up  with many a stately stayre 

    to honors seat and chastities sweet bowre 

    why stand ye still ye virgins in amaze 

    upon her so to gaze 

    whiles ye forget your former lay to sing 

    to which the woods did answer  and your eccho ring 



    but if ye saw that which no eyes can see 

    the inward beauty of her lively spright 

    garnisht with heavenly guifts of high degree 

    much more then would ye wonder at that sight 

    and stand astonisht lyke to those which red

    medusaes mazeful hed 

    there dwels sweet love  and constant chastity 

    unspotted fayth  and comely womanhood 

    regard of honour  and mild modesty 

    there vertue raynes as queene in royal throne 

    and giveth lawes alone 

    the which the base affections doe obay 

    and yeeld theyr services unto her will 

    ne thought of thing uncomely ever may

    thereto approch to tempt her mind to ill 

    had ye once seene these her celestial threasures 

    and unrevealèd pleasures 

    then would ye wonder  and her prayses sing 

    that al the woods should answer  and your echo ring 



    open the temple gates unto my love 

    open them wide that she may enter in 

    and all the postes adorne as doth behove 

    and all the pillours deck with girlands trim 

    for to receyve this saynt with honour dew 

    that commeth in to you 

    with trembling steps  and humble reverence 

    she commeth in  before th’ almighties view 

    of her ye virgins learne obedience 

    when so ye come into those holy places 

    to humble your proud faces 

    bring her up to th’ high altar  that she may

    the sacred ceremonies there partake 

    the which do endlesse matrimony make 

    and let the roring organs loudly play

    the praises of the lord in lively notes 

    the whiles  with hollow throates 

    the choristers the joyous antheme sing 

    that al the woods may answere  and their eccho ring 



    behold  whiles she before the altar stands 

    hearing the holy priest that to her speakes 

    and blesseth her with his two happy hands 

    how the red roses flush up in her cheekes 

    and the pure snow  with goodly vermill stayne

    like crimsin dyde in grayne 

    that even th’ angels  which continually

    about the sacred altare doe remaine 

    forget their service and about her fly 

    ofte peeping in her face  that seems more fayre 

    the more they on it stare 

    but her sad eyes  still fastened on the ground 

    are governèd with goodly modesty 

    that suffers not one looke to glaunce awry 

    which may let in a little thought unsownd 

    why blush ye  love  to give to me your hand 

    the pledge of all our band 

    sing  ye sweet angels  alleluya sing 

    that all the woods may answere  and your eccho ring 



    now al is done  bring home the bride againe 

    bring home the triumph of our victory 

    bring home with you the glory of her gaine 

    with joyance bring her and with jollity 

    never had man more joyfull day then this 

    whom heaven would heape with blis 

    make feast therefore now all this live long day 

    this day for ever to me holy is 

    poure out the wine without restraint or stay 

    poure not by cups  but by the belly full 

    poure out to all that wull 

    and sprinkle all the postes and wals with wine 

    that they may sweat  and drunken be withall 

    crowne ye god bacchus with a coronall 

    and hymen also crowne with wreathes of vine 

    and let the graces daunce unto the rest 

    for they can doo it best 

    the whiles the maydens doe theyr carroll sing 

    to which the woods shall answer  and theyr eccho ring 





    ring ye the bels  ye yong men of the towne 

    and leave your wonted labors for this day 

    this day is holy  doe ye write it downe 

    that ye for ever it remember may 

    this day the sunne is in his chiefest hight 

    with barnaby the bright 

    from whence declining daily by degrees 

    he somewhat loseth of his heat and light 

    when once the crab behind his back he sees 

    but for this time it ill ordainèd was 

    to chose the longest day in all the yeare 

    and shortest night  when longest fitter weare 

    yet never day so long  but late would passe 

    ring ye the bels  to make it weare away 

    and bonefiers make all day 

    and daunce about them  and about them sing 

    that all the woods may answer  and your eccho ring 



    ah  when will this long weary day have end 

    and lende me leave to come unto my love 

    how slowly do the houres theyr numbers spend 

    how slowly does sad time his feathers move 

    hast thee  o fayrest planet  to thy home 

    within the westerne fome 

    thy tyrèd steedes long since have need of rest 

    long though it be  at last i see it gloome 

    and the bright evening star with golden creast

    appeare out of the east 

    fayre childe of beauty  glorious lampe of love 

    that all the host of heaven in rankes doost lead 

    and guydest lovers through the nights sad dread 

    how chearefully thou lookest from above 

    and seemst to laugh atweene thy twinkling light 

    as joying in the sight

    of these glad many  which for joy doe sing 

    that all the woods them answer  and their echo ring 



    now ceasse  ye damsels  your delights fore past 

    enough it is that all the day was youres 

    now day is doen  and night is nighing fast 

    now bring the bryde into the brydall boures 

    the night is come  now soon her disaray 

    and in her bed her lay 

    lay her in lillies and in violets 

    and silken courteins over her display 

    and odourd sheetes  and arras coverlets 

    behold how goodly my faire love does ly 

    in proud humility 

    like unto maia  when as jove her took

    in tempe  lying on the flowry gras 

    twixt sleepe and wake  after she weary was 

    with bathing in the acidalian brooke 

    now it is night  ye damsels may be gon 

    and leave my love alone 

    and leave likewise your former lay to sing 

    the woods no more shall answere  nor your echo ring 



    now welcome  night  thou night so long expected 

    that long daies labour doest at last defray 

    and all my cares  which cruell love collected 

    hast sumd in one  and cancellèd for aye 

    spread thy broad wing over my love and me 

    that no man may us see 

    and in thy sable mantle us enwrap 

    from feare of perrill and foule horror free 

    let no false treason seeke us to entrap 

    nor any dread disquiet once annoy

    the safety of our joy 

    but let the night be calme  and quietsome 

    without tempestuous storms or sad afray 

    lyke as when jove with fayre alcmena lay 

    when he begot the great tirynthian groome 

    or lyke as when he with thy selfe did lie

    and begot majesty 

    and let the mayds and yong men cease to sing 

    ne let the woods them answer nor theyr eccho ring 



    let no lamenting cryes  nor dolefull teares 

    be heard all night within  nor yet without 

    ne let false whispers  breeding hidden feares 

    breake gentle sleepe with misconceivèd dout 

    let no deluding dreames  nor dreadfull sights 

    make sudden sad affrights 

    ne let house fyres  nor lightnings helpelesse harmes 

    ne let the pouke  nor other evill sprights 

    ne let mischivous witches with theyr charmes 

    ne let hob goblins  names whose sence we see not 

    fray us with things that be not 

    let not the shriech oule nor the storke be heard 

    nor the night raven  that still deadly yels 

    nor damnèd ghosts  cald up with mighty spels 

    nor griesly vultures  make us once affeard 

    ne let th’ unpleasant quyre of frogs still croking

    make us to wish theyr choking 

    let none of these theyr drery accents sing 

    ne let the woods them answer  nor theyr eccho ring 



    but let stil silence trew night watches keepe 

    that sacred peace may in assurance rayne 

    and tymely sleep  when it is tyme to sleepe 

    may poure his limbs forth on your pleasant playne 

    the whiles an hundred little wingèd loves 

    like divers fethered doves 

    shall fly and flutter round about your bed 

    and in the secret darke  that none reproves 

    their prety stealthes shal worke  and snares shal spread

    to filch away sweet snatches of delight 

    conceald through covert night 

    ye sonnes of venus  play your sports at will 

    for greedy pleasure  carelesse of your toyes 

    thinks more upon her paradise of joyes 

    then what ye do  albe it good or ill 

    all night therefore attend your merry play 

    for it will soone be day 

    now none doth hinder you  that say or sing 

    ne will the woods now answer  nor your eccho ring 



    who is the same  which at my window peepes 

    or whose is that faire face that shines so bright 

    is it not cinthia  she that never sleepes 

    but walkes about high heaven al the night 

    o  fayrest goddesse  do thou not envy

    my love with me to spy 

    for thou likewise didst love  though now unthought 

    and for a fleece of wooll  which privily

    the latmian shepherd once unto thee brought 

    his pleasures with thee wrought 

    therefore to us be favorable now 

    and sith of wemens labours thou hast charge 

    and generation goodly dost enlarge 

    encline thy will t’effect our wishfull vow 

    and the chast wombe informe with timely seed

    that may our comfort breed 

    till which we cease our hopefull hap to sing 

    ne let the woods us answere  nor our eccho ring 





    and thou  great juno  which with awful might

    the lawes of wedlock still dost patronize 

    and the religion of the faith first plight

    with sacred rites hast taught to solemnize 

    and eeke for comfort often callèd art

    of women in their smart 

    eternally bind thou this lovely band 

    and all thy blessings unto us impart 

    and thou  glad genius  in whose gentle hand

    the bridale bowre and geniall bed remaine 

    without blemish or staine 

    and the sweet pleasures of theyr loves delight

    with secret ayde doest succour and supply 

    till they bring forth the fruitfull progeny 

    send us the timely fruit of this same night 

    and thou  fayre hebe  and thou  hymen free 

    grant that it may so be 

    til which we cease your further prayse to sing 

    ne any woods shall answer  nor your eccho ring 



    and ye high heavens  the temple of the gods 

    in which a thousand torches flaming bright

    doe burne  that to us wretched earthly clods

    in dreadful darknesse lend desirèd light

    and all ye powers which in the same remayne 

    more then we men can fayne 

    poure out your blessing on us plentiously 

    and happy influence upon us raine 

    that we may raise a large posterity 

    which from the earth  which they may long possesse

    with lasting happinesse 

    up to your haughty pallaces may mount 

    and  for the guerdon of theyr glorious merit 

    may heavenly tabernacles there inherit 

    of blessèd saints for to increase the count 

    so let us rest  sweet love  in hope of this 

    and cease till then our tymely joyes to sing 

    the woods no more us answer  nor our eccho ring 



     song  made in lieu of many ornaments  

     with which my love should duly have been dect  

     which cutting off through hasty accidents  

     ye would not stay your dew time to expect 

     but promist both to recompens  

     be unto her a goodly ornament  

     and for short time an endlesse moniment  





 83    from ‘daphnaïda’ 



 an elegy 



    she fell away in her first ages spring 

    whil’st yet her leafe was greene  and fresh her rinde 

    and whil’st her braunch faire blossomes foorth did bring 

    she fell away against all course of kinde 

    for age to dye is right  but youth is wrong 

    she fel away like fruit blowne downe with winde 

    weepe  shepheard  weepe  to make my undersong 



    yet fell she not as one enforst to dye 

    ne dyde with dread and grudging discontent 

    but as one toyld with travaile downe doth lye 

    so lay she downe  as if to sleepe she went 

    and closde her eyes with carelesse quietnesse 

    the whiles soft death away her spirit hent 

    and soule assoyld from sinfull fleshlinesse 





    how happie was i when i saw her leade

    the shepheards daughters dauncing in a rownd 

    how trimly would she trace and softly tread

    the tender grasse  with rosie garland crownd 

    and when she list advance her heavenly voyce 

    both nymphes and muses nigh she made astownd 

    and flocks and shepheards causèd to rejoyce 



    but now  ye shepheard lasses  who shall lead

    your wandring troupes  or sing your virelayes 

    or who shall dight your bowres  sith she is dead

    that was the lady of your holy dayes 

    let now your blisse be turnèd into bale 

    and into plaints convert your joyous playes 

    and with the same fill every hill and dale 



    for i will walke this wandring pilgrimage 

    throughout the world from one to other end 

    and in affliction wast my better age 

    my bread shall be the anguish of my mind 

    my drink the teares which fro mine eyes do raine 

    my bed the ground that hardest i may finde 

    so will i wilfully increase my paine 



    ne sleepe  the harbenger of wearie wights 

    shall ever lodge upon mine ey lids more 

    ne shall with rest refresh my fainting sprights 

    nor failing force to former strength restore 

    but i will wake and sorrow all the night

    with philumene  my fortune to deplore 

    with philumene  the partner of my plight 



    and ever as i see the starres to fall 

    and under ground to goe to give them light

    which dwell in darknes  i to minde will call

    how my fair starre  that shinde on me so bright 

    fell sodainly and faded under ground 

    since whose departure  day is turnd to night 

    and night without a venus starre is found 



    and she  my love that was  my saint that is 

    when she beholds from her celestiall throne

     in which shee joyeth in eternall blis 

    my bitter penance  will my case bemone 

    and pitie me that living thus doo die 

    for heavenly spirits have compassion

    on mortall men  and rue their miserie 



    so when i have with sorowe satisfide

    th’ importune fates  which vengeance on me seeke 

    and th’ heavens with long languor pacifide 

    she  for pure pitie of my sufferance meeke 

    will send for me  for which i daylie long 

    and will till then my painful penance eeke 

    weep  shepheard  weep  to make my undersong 





 84    easter 



    most glorious lord of lyfe  that  on this day 

    didst make thy triumph over death and sin 

    and  having harrowd hell  didst bring away

    captivity thence captive  us to win 

    this joyous day  deare lord  with joy begin 

    and grant that we  for whom thou diddest dye 

    being with thy deare blood clene washt from sin 

    may live for ever in felicity 

    and that thy love we weighing worthily 

    may likewise love thee for the same againe 

    and for thy sake  that all lyke deare didst buy 

    with love may one another entertayne 

      so let us love  deare love  lyke as we ought 

      love is the lesson which the lord us taught

 85    cards and kisses 



    cupid and my campaspe play’d

    at cards for kisses  cupid paid 

    he stakes his quiver  bow  and arrows 

    his mother’s doves  and team of sparrows 

    loses them too  then down he throws

    the coral of his lips  the rose

    growing on’s cheek  but none knows how  

    with these  the crystal of his brow 

    and then the dimple of his chin 

    all these did my campaspe win 

    at last he set her both his eyes  

    she won  and cupid blind did rise 

      o love  has she done this for thee 

      what shall  alas  become of me 





 86    spring’s welcome 



    what bird so sings  yet so does wail 

    o ’tis the ravish’d nightingale 

     jug  jug  jug  jug  tereu   she cries 

    and still her woes at midnight rise 

    brave prick song  who is’t now we hear 

    none but the lark so shrill and clear 

    now at heaven’s gate she claps her wings 

    the morn not waking till she sings 

    hark  hark  with what a pretty throat

    poor robin redbreast tunes his note 

    hark how the jolly cuckoos sing

     cuckoo   to welcome in the spring 

     cuckoo   to welcome in the spring

 87    beauty bathing 



    beauty sat bathing by a spring 

      where fairest shades did hide her 

    the winds blew calm  the birds did sing 

      the cool streams ran beside her 

    my wanton thoughts enticed mine eye

      to see what was forbidden 

    but better memory said fie 

      so vain desire was chidden  

                  hey nonny nonny o 

                  hey nonny nonny 



    into a slumber then i fell 

      and fond imagination

    seemèd to see  but could not tell 

      her feature or her fashion 

    but ev’n as babes in dreams do smile 

      and sometimes fall a weeping 

    so i awaked as wise that while

      as when i fell a sleeping

 88    the bargain 



    my true love hath my heart  and i have his 

      but just exchange one for another given 

    i hold his dear  and mine he cannot miss 

      there never was a better bargain driven 

          my true love hath my heart  and i have his 



    his heart in me keeps him and me in one 

      my heart in him his thoughts and senses guides 

    he loves my heart  for once it was his own 

      i cherish his because in me it bides 

          my true love hath my heart  and i have his 





 89    song 



    who hath his fancy pleasèd

      with fruits of happy sight 

    let here his eyes be raisèd

      on nature’s sweetest light 

    a light which doth dissever

      and yet unite the eyes 

    a light which  dying never 

      is cause the looker dies 



    she never dies  but lasteth

      in life of lover’s heart 

    he ever dies that wasteth

      in love his chiefest part 

    thus is her life still guarded

      in never dying faith 

    thus is his death rewarded 

      since she lives in his death 





    look then  and die  the pleasure

      doth answer well the pain 

    small loss of mortal treasure 

      who may immortal gain 

    immortal be her graces 

      immortal is her mind 

    they  fit for heavenly places  

      this  heaven in it doth bind 



    but eyes these beauties see not 

      nor sense that grace descries 

    yet eyes deprivèd be not

      from sight of her fair eyes  

    which  as of inward glory

      they are the outward seal 

    so may they live still sorry 

      which die not in that weal 



    but who hath fancies pleasèd

      with fruits of happy sight 

    let here his eyes be raisèd

      on nature’s sweetest light 





 90    voices at the window 



     who is it that  this dark night  

       underneath my window plaineth  

    it is one who from thy sight

      being  ah  exiled  disdaineth

    every other vulgar light 



     why  alas  and are you he  

       be not yet those fancies changèd  

    dear  when you find change in me 

      though from me you be estrangèd 

    let my change to ruin be 





     well  in absence this will die  

       leave to see  and leave to wonder  

    absence sure will help  if i

     can learn how myself to sunder

    from what in my heart doth lie 



     but time will these thoughts remove  

       time doth work what no man knoweth  

    time doth as the subject prove 

      with time still the affection groweth

    in the faithful turtle dove 



     what if you new beauties see  

       will not they stir new affection  

    i will think they pictures be

       image like  of saints’ perfection 

    poorly counterfeiting thee 



     but your reason’s purest light 

       bids you leave such minds to nourish  

    dear  do reason no such spite 

      never doth thy beauty flourish

    more than in my reason’s sight 



      90   leave  cease 





 91    philomela 



    the nightingale  as soon as april bringeth

      unto her rested sense a perfect waking 

    while late bare earth  proud of new clothing  springeth 

      sings out her woes  a thorn her song book making 

            and mournfully bewailing 

            her throat in tunes expresseth

            what grief her breast oppresseth 

    for tereus’ force on her chaste will prevailing 





       o philomela fair  o take some gladness 

       that here is juster cause of plaintful sadness  

           thine earth now springs  mine fadeth  

       thy thorn without  my thorn my heart invadeth  



    alas  she hath no other cause of anguish

      but tereus’ love  on her by strong hand wroken 

    wherein she suffering  all her spirits languish 

      full womanlike complains her will was broken

          but i  who  daily craving 

          cannot have to content me 

          have more cause to lament me 

    since wanting is more woe than too much having 



       o philomela fair  o take some gladness 

       that here is juster cause of plaintful sadness  

           thine earth now springs  mine fadeth  

       thy thorn without  my thorn my heart invadeth  





 92    the highway 



    highway  since you my chief parnassus be 

    and that my muse  to some ears not unsweet 

    tempers her words to trampling horses’ feet

    more oft than to a chamber melody   

    now blessèd you bear onward blessèd me

    to her  where i my heart  safe left  shall meet 

    my muse and i must you of duty greet

    with thanks and wishes  wishing thankfully 

    be you still fair  honour’d by public heed 

    by no encroachment wrong’d  nor time forgot 

    nor blamed for blood  nor shamed for sinful deed 

    and that you know i envy you no lot

      of highest wish  i wish you so much bliss 

      hundreds of years you stella’s feet may kiss 





 93    his lady’s cruelty 



    with how sad steps  o moon  thou climb’st the skies 

    how silently  and with how wan a face 

    what  may it be that even in heavenly place

    that busy archer his sharp arrows tries 

    sure  if that long with love acquainted eyes

    can judge of love  thou feel’st a lover’s case 

    i read it in thy looks  thy languish’d grace

    to me  that feel the like  thy state descries 

    then  even of fellowship  o moon  tell me 

    is constant love deem’d there but want of wit 

    are beauties there as proud as here they be 

    do they above love to be loved  and yet

      those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess 

      do they call ‘virtue’ there  ungratefulness 





 94    sleep 



    come  sleep  o sleep  the certain knot of peace 

    the baiting place of wit  the balm of woe 

    the poor man’s wealth  the prisoner’s release 

    th’ indifferent judge between the high and low 

    with shield of proof shield me from out the prease

    of those fierce darts despair at me doth throw 

    o make in me those civil wars to cease 

    i will good tribute pay  if thou do so 

    take thou of me smooth pillows  sweetest bed 

    a chamber deaf to noise and blind of light 

    a rosy garland and a weary head 

    and if these things  as being thine by right 

      move not thy heavy grace  thou shalt in me 

      livelier than elsewhere  stella’s image see 



      94   prease  press 





 95    splendidis longum valedico nugis 



    leave me  o love  which reachest but to dust 

    and thou  my mind  aspire to higher things 

    grow rich in that which never taketh rust 

    whatever fades  but fading pleasure brings 

    draw in thy beams  and humble all thy might

    to that sweet yoke where lasting freedoms be 

    which breaks the clouds and opens forth the light

    that doth both shine and give us sight to see 

    o take fast hold  let that light be thy guide

    in this small course which birth draws out to death 

    and think how evil becometh him to slide

    who seeketh heaven  and comes of heavenly breath 

      then farewell  world  thy uttermost i see 

      eternal love  maintain thy life in me

      i  that ware posies of her own hand making 

    i  that mine own name in the chimneys read

      by myra finely wrought ere i was waking 

    must i look on  in hope time coming may

    with change bring back my turn again to play 



    i  that on sunday at the church stile found

      a garland sweet with true love knots in flowers 

    which i to wear about mine arms was bound

      that each of us might know that all was ours 

    must i lead now an idle life in wishes 

    and follow cupid for his loaves and fishes 



      96   chimneys   cheminées   chimney screens of tapestry work 



    i  that did wear the ring her mother left 

      i  for whose love she gloried to be blamèd 

    i  with whose eyes her eyes committed theft 

      i  who did make her blush when i was namèd 

    must i lose ring  flowers  blush  theft  and go naked 

    watching with sighs till dead love be awakèd 



    was it for this that i might myra see

      washing the water with her beauty’s white 

    yet would she never write her love to me 

      thinks wit of change when thoughts are in delight 

    mad girls may safely love as they may leave 

    no man can  print  a kiss  lines may deceive 



      96   deceive  betray

 97    rosalind’s madrigal 



    love in my bosom like a bee

          doth suck his sweet 

    now with his wings he plays with me 

          now with his feet 

    within mine eyes he makes his nest 

    his bed amidst my tender breast 

    my kisses are his daily feast 

    and yet he robs me of my rest 

          ah  wanton  will ye 



    and if i sleep  then percheth he

          with pretty flight 

    and makes his pillow of my knee

          the livelong night 

    strike i my lute  he tunes the string 

    he music plays if so i sing 

    he lends me every lovely thing 

    yet cruel he my heart doth sting 

          whist  wanton  still ye 



    else i with roses every day

          will whip you hence 

    and bind you  when you long to play 

          for your offence 

    i’ll shut mine eyes to keep you in 

    i’ll make you fast it for your sin 

    i’ll count your power not worth a pin 

      alas  what hereby shall i win

          if he gainsay me 



    what if i beat the wanton boy

          with many a rod 

    he will repay me with annoy 

          because a god 

    then sit thou safely on my knee 

    then let thy bower my bosom be 

    lurk in mine eyes  i like of thee 

    o cupid  so thou pity me 

          spare not  but play thee 





 98    phillis  i



    my phillis hath the morning sun

      at first to look upon her 

    and phillis hath morn waking birds

      her risings still to honour 

    my phillis hath prime feather’d flowers 

      that smile when she treads on them 

    and phillis hath a gallant flock 

      that leaps since she doth own them 

    but phillis hath too hard a heart 

      alas that she should have it 

    it yields no mercy to desert 

      nor grace to those that crave it 





 99    phillis  2



    love guards the roses of thy lips

      and flies about them like a bee 

    if i approach he forward skips 

      and if i kiss he stingeth me 



    love in thine eyes doth build his bower 

      and sleeps within their pretty shine 

    and if i look the boy will lower 

      and from their orbs shoot shafts divine 



    love works thy heart within his fire 

      and in my tears doth firm the same 

    and if i tempt it will retire 

      and of my plaints doth make a game 



    love  let me cull her choicest flowers 

      and pity me  and calm her eye 

    make soft her heart  dissolve her lowers

      then will i praise thy deity 



    but if thou do not  love  i’ll truly serve her

    in spite of thee  and by firm faith deserve her 





 100    rosaline 



    like to the clear in highest sphere

      where all imperial glory shines 

    of selfsame colour is her hair

      whether unfolded or in twines 

          heigh ho  fair rosaline 

    her eyes are sapphires set in snow 

      resembling heaven by every wink 

    the gods do fear whenas they glow 

      and i do tremble when i think

          heigh ho  would she were mine 



    her cheeks are like the blushing cloud

      that beautifies aurora’s face 

    or like the silver crimson shroud

      that phœbus’ smiling looks doth grace 

          heigh ho  fair rosaline 

    her lips are like two budded roses

      whom ranks of lilies neighbour nigh 

    within whose bounds she balm encloses

      apt to entice a deity 

          heigh ho  would she were mine 



    her neck like to a stately tower

      where love himself imprison’d lies 

    to watch for glances every hour

      from her divine and sacred eyes 

          heigh ho  fair rosaline 

    her paps are centres of delight 

      her breasts are orbs of heavenly frame 

    where nature moulds the dew of light

      to feed perfection with the same 

          heigh ho  would she were mine 





    with orient pearl  with ruby red 

      with marble white  with sapphire blue 

    her body every way is fed 

      yet soft to touch and sweet in view 

          heigh ho  fair rosaline 

    nature herself her shape admires 

      the gods are wounded in her sight 

    and love forsakes his heavenly fires

      and at her eyes his brand doth light 

          heigh ho  would she were mine 



    then muse not  nymphs  though i bemoan

      the absence of fair rosaline 

    since for a fair there’s fairer none 

      nor for her virtues so divine 

          heigh ho  fair rosaline 

    heigh ho  my heart  would god that she were mine

 102    a farewell to arms 



 to queen elizabeth 



    his golden locks time hath to silver turn’d 

      o time too swift  o swiftness never ceasing 

    his youth ’gainst time and age hath ever spurn’d 

      but spurn’d in vain  youth waneth by increasing 

    beauty  strength  youth  are flowers but fading seen 

    duty  faith  love  are roots  and ever green 



    his helmet now shall make a hive for bees 

      and  lovers’ sonnets turn’d to holy psalms 

    a man at arms must now serve on his knees 

      and feed on prayers  which are age his alms 

    but though from court to cottage he depart 

    his saint is sure of his unspotted heart 





    and when he saddest sits in homely cell 

      he’ll teach his swains this carol for a song   

    ‘blest be the hearts that wish my sovereign well 

      curst be the souls that think her any wrong ’

    goddess  allow this agèd man his right

    to be your beadsman now that was your knight

    like to diana in her summer weed 

      girt with a crimson robe of brightest dye 

            goes fair samela 

    whiter than be the flocks that straggling feed

      when wash’d by arethusa faint they lie 

            is fair samela 

    as fair aurora in her morning grey 

      deck’d with the ruddy glister of her love

            is fair samela 

    like lovely thetis on a calmèd day

      whenas her brightness neptune’s fancy move 

            shines fair samela 



    her tresses gold  her eyes like glassy streams 

      her teeth are pearl  the breasts are ivory

            of fair samela 

    her cheeks like rose and lily yield forth gleams 

      her brows bright arches framed of ebony 

            thus fair samela

    passeth fair venus in her bravest hue 

      and juno in the show of majesty

             for she’s samela   

    pallas in wit   all three  if you well view 

      for beauty  wit  and matchless dignity 

            yield to samela 





 104    fawnia 



    ah  were she pitiful as she is fair 

    or but as mild as she is seeming so 

    then were my hopes greater than my despair 

    then all the world were heaven  nothing woe 

    ah  were her heart relenting as her hand 

    that seems to melt even with the mildest touch 

    then knew i where to seat me in a land

    under wide heavens  but yet there is not such 

    so as she shows she seems the budding rose 

    yet sweeter far than is an earthly flower 

    sovran of beauty  like the spray she grows 

    compass’d she is with thorns and canker’d flower 

      yet were she willing to be pluck’d and worn 

      she would be gather’d  though she grew on thorn 



    ah  when she sings  all music else be still 

    for none must be comparèd to her note 

    ne’er breathed such glee from philomela’s bill 

    nor from the morning singer’s swelling throat 

    ah  when she riseth from her blissful bed

    she comforts all the world as doth the sun 

    and at her sight the night’s foul vapour’s fled 

    when she is set the gladsome day is done 

      o glorious sun  imagine me the west 

      shine in my arms  and set thou in my breast 





 105    sephestia’s lullaby 



    weep not  my wanton  smile upon my knee 

    when thou art old there’s grief enough for thee 

          mother’s wag  pretty boy 

          father’s sorrow  father’s joy 

          when thy father first did see

          such a boy by him and me 

          he was glad  i was woe 

          fortune changèd made him so 

          when he left his pretty boy 

          last his sorrow  first his joy 



    weep not  my wanton  smile upon my knee 

    when thou art old there’s grief enough for thee 

          streaming tears that never stint 

          like pearl drops from a flint 

          fell by course from his eyes 

          that one another’s place supplies 

          thus he grieved in every part 

          tears of blood fell from his heart 

          when he left his pretty boy 

          father’s sorrow  father’s joy 



    weep not  my wanton  smile upon my knee 

    when thou art old there’s grief enough for thee 

          the wanton smiled  father wept 

          mother cried  baby leapt 

          more he crow’d  more we cried 

          nature could not sorrow hide 

          he must go  he must kiss

          child and mother  baby bliss 

          for he left his pretty boy 

          father’s sorrow  father’s joy 



    weep not  my wanton  smile upon my knee 

    when thou art old there’s grief enough for thee

 106    a summer day 



    o perfect light  which shaid away

      the darkness from the light 

    and set a ruler o’er the day 

      another o’er the night  



    thy glory  when the day forth flies 

      more vively doth appear

    than at mid day unto our eyes

      the shining sun is clear 



    the shadow of the earth anon

      removes and drawis by 

    while in the east  when it is gone 

      appears a clearer sky 



    which soon perceive the little larks 

      the lapwing and the snipe 

    and tune their songs  like nature’s clerks 

      o’er meadow  muir  and stripe 



    our hemisphere is polisht clean 

      and lighten’d more and more 

    while everything is clearly seen

      which seemit dim before 



    except the glistering astres bright 

      which all the night were clear 

    offuskit with a greater light

      no longer do appear 



     shaid  parted  stripe  rill  offuskit  darkened 



    the golden globe incontinent

      sets up his shining head 

    and o’er the earth and firmament

      displays his beams abread 



    for joy the birds with boulden throats

      against his visage sheen

    take up their kindly musick notes

      in woods and gardens green 



    the dew upon the tender crops 

      like pearlis white and round 

    or like to melted silver drops 

      refreshis all the ground 



    the misty reek  the clouds of rain 

      from tops of mountains skails 

    clear are the highest hills and plain 

      the vapours take the vales 



    the ample heaven of fabrick sure

      in cleanness does surpass

    the crystal and the silver pure 

      or clearest polisht glass 



    the time so tranquil is and still

      that nowhere shall ye find 

    save on a high and barren hill 

      an air of peeping wind 



    all trees and simples  great and small 

      that balmy leaf do bear 

    than they were painted on a wall

      no more they move or steir 



     boulden  swollen  sheen  bright  skails  clears  simples  herbs 



    calm is the deep and purple sea 

      yea  smoother than the sand 

    the waves that weltering wont to be

      are stable like the land 



    so silent is the cessile air

      that every cry and call

    the hills and dales and forest fair

      again repeats them all 



    the flourishes and fragrant flowers 

      through phoebus’ fostering heat 

    refresht with dew and silver showers

      cast up an odour sweet 



    the cloggit busy humming bees 

      that never think to drone 

    on flowers and flourishes of trees

      collect their liquor brown 



    the sun  most like a speedy post

      with ardent course ascends 

    the beauty of the heavenly host

      up to our zenith tends 



    the burning beams down from his face

      so fervently can beat 

    that man and beast now seek a place

      to save them from the heat 



    the herds beneath some leafy tree

      amidst the flowers they lie 

    the stable ships upon the sea

      tend up their sails to dry 



     cessile  yielding  ceasing  flourishes  blossoms 



    with gilded eyes and open wings

      the cock his courage shows 

    with claps of joy his breast he dings 

      and twenty times he crows 



    the dove with whistling wings so blue

      the winds can fast collect 

    her purple pens turn many a hue

      against the sun direct 



    now noon is went  gone is midday 

      the heat doth slake at last 

    the sun descends down west away 

      for three of clock is past 



    the rayons of the sun we see

      diminish in their strength 

    the shade of every tower and tree

      extendit is in length 



    great is the calm  for everywhere

      the wind is setting down 

    the reek throws right up in the air

      from every tower and town 



    the gloming comes  the day is spent 

      the sun goes out of sight 

    and painted is the occident

      with purple sanguine bright 



    our west horizon circular

      from time the sun be set

    is all with rubies  as it were 

      or roses red o’erfret 





    what pleasure were to walk and see 

      endlong a river clear 

    the perfect form of every tree

      within the deep appear 



    o then it were a seemly thing 

      while all is still and calm 

    the praise of god to play and sing

      with cornet and with shalm 



    all labourers draw home at even 

      and can to other say 

    thanks to the gracious god of heaven 

      which sent this summer day

 107    bridal song 



    o come  soft rest of cares  come  night 

      come  naked virtue’s only tire 

    the reapèd harvest of the light

      bound up in sheaves of sacred fire 

        love calls to war 

          sighs his alarms 

        lips his swords are 

          the field his arms 



    come  night  and lay thy velvet hand

      on glorious day’s outfacing face 

    and all thy crownèd flames command

      for torches to our nuptial grace 

        love calls to war 

          sighs his alarms 

        lips his swords are 

          the field his arms

 108    times go by turns 



    the loppèd tree in time may grow again 

    most naked plants renew both fruit and flower 

    the sorest wight may find release of pain 

    the driest soil suck in some moist’ning shower 

    times go by turns and chances change by course 

    from foul to fair  from better hap to worse 



    the sea of fortune doth not ever flow 

    she draws her favours to the lowest ebb 

    her tides hath equal times to come and go 

    her loom doth weave the fine and coarsest web 

    no joy so great but runneth to an end 

    no hap so hard but may in fine amend 



    not always fall of leaf nor ever spring 

    no endless night yet not eternal day 

    the saddest birds a season find to sing 

    the roughest storm a calm may soon allay 

    thus with succeeding turns god tempereth all 

    that man may hope to rise  yet fear to fall 



    a chance may win that by mischance was lost 

    the net that holds no great  takes little fish 

    in some things all  in all things none are crost 

    few all they need  but none have all they wish 

    unmeddled joys here to no man befall 

    who least  hath some  who most  hath never all 



     unmeddled  unmixed 





 109    the burning babe 



    as i in hoary winter’s night

      stood shivering in the snow 

    surprised i was with sudden heat

      which made my heart to glow 

    and lifting up a fearful eye

      to view what fire was near 

    a pretty babe all burning bright

      did in the air appear 

    who  scorchèd with excessive heat 

      such floods of tears did shed 

    as though his floods should quench his flames 

      which with his tears were bred 

    ‘alas ’ quoth he  ‘but newly born

      in fiery heats i fry 

    yet none approach to warm their hearts

      or feel my fire but i 



    ‘my faultless breast the furnace is 

      the fuel  wounding thorns 

    love is the fire  and sighs the smoke 

      the ashes  shames and scorns 

    the fuel justice layeth on 

      and mercy blows the coals 

    the metal in this furnace wrought

      are men’s defilèd souls 

    for which  as now on fire i am

      to work them to their good 

    so will i melt into a bath 

      to wash them in my blood ’

    with this he vanish’d out of sight

      and swiftly shrunk away 

    and straight i callèd unto mind

      that it was christmas day

 110    on the death of sir philip sidney 



    give pardon  blessèd soul  to my bold cries 

    if they  importune  interrupt thy song 

    which now with joyful notes thou sing’st among

    the angel quiristers of th’ heavenly skies 

    give pardon eke  sweet soul  to my slow eyes 

    that since i saw thee now it is so long 

    and yet the tears that unto thee belong

    to thee as yet they did not sacrifice 

    i did not know that thou wert dead before 

    i did not feel the grief i did sustain 

    the greater stroke astonisheth the more 

    astonishment takes from us sense of pain 

      i stood amazed when others’ tears begun 

      and now begin to weep when they have done

    love is a sickness full of woes 

      all remedies refusing 

    a plant that with most cutting grows 

      most barren with best using 

                      why so 

    more we enjoy it  more it dies 

    if not enjoy’d  it sighing cries  

                          heigh ho 



    love is a torment of the mind 

      a tempest everlasting 

    and jove hath made it of a kind

      not well  nor full nor fasting 

                      why so 

    more we enjoy it  more it dies 

    if not enjoy’d  it sighing cries

                 possess these shores with me 

               the winds and seas are troublesome 

                 and here we may be free 

               here may we sit and view their toil

                 that travail in the deep 

               and joy the day in mirth the while 

                 and spend the night in sleep 



     ulysses   fair nymph  if fame or honour were

                 to be attain’d with ease 

               then would i come and rest me there 

                 and leave such toils as these 

               but here it dwells  and here must i

                 with danger seek it forth 

               to spend the time luxuriously

                 becomes not men of worth 



       siren   ulysses  o be not deceived

                 with that unreal name 

               this honour is a thing conceived 

                 and rests on others’ fame 

               begotten only to molest

                 our peace  and to beguile

               the best thing of our life  our rest 

                 and give us up to toil 





     ulysses   delicious nymph  suppose there were

                 no honour nor report 

               yet manliness would scorn to wear

                 the time in idle sport 

               for toil doth give a better touch

                 to make us feel our joy 

               and ease finds tediousness as much

                 as labour yields annoy 



       siren   then pleasure likewise seems the shore

                 whereto tends all your toil 

               which you forgo to make it more 

                 and perish oft the while 

               who may disport them diversely

                 find never tedious day 

               and ease may have variety

                 as well as action may 



     ulysses   but natures of the noblest frame

                 these toils and dangers please 

               and they take comfort in the same

                 as much as you in ease 

               and with the thought of actions past

                 are recreated still 

               when pleasure leaves a touch at last

                 to show that it was ill 



       siren   that doth  opinion  only cause

                 that’s out of  custom  bred 

               which makes us many other laws

                 than ever  nature  did 

               no widows wail for our delights 

                 our sports are without blood 

               the world we see by warlike wights

                 receives more hurt than good 





     ulysses   but yet the state of things require

                 these motions of unrest 

               and these great spirits of high desire

                 seem born to turn them best 

               to purge the mischiefs that increase

                 and all good order mar 

               for oft we see a wicked peace

                 to be well changed for war 



       siren   well  well  ulysses  then i see

                 i shall not have thee here 

               and therefore i will come to thee 

                 and take my fortune there 

               i must be won  that cannot win 

                 yet lost were i not won 

               for beauty hath created been

                 t’ undo  or be undone 





 113    beauty  time  and love 





sonnets  i



    fair is my love and cruel as she’s fair 

    her brow shades frown  although her eyes are sunny 

    her smiles are lightning  though her pride despair 

    and her disdains are gall  her favours honey 

    a modest maid  deck’d with a blush of honour 

    whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love 

    the wonder of all eyes that look upon her 

    sacred on earth  design’d a saint above 

    chastity and beauty  which were deadly foes 

    live reconcilèd friends within her brow 

    and had she pity to conjoin with those 

    then who had heard the plaints i utter now 

      for had she not been fair  and thus unkind 

      my muse had slept  and none had known my mind 





ii



    my spotless love hovers with purest wings 

    about the temple of the proudest frame 

    where blaze those lights  fairest of earthly things 

    which clear our clouded world with brightest flame 

    my ambitious thoughts  confinèd in her face 

    affect no honour but what she can give 

    my hopes do rest in limits of her grace 

    i weigh no comfort unless she relieve 

    for she  that can my heart imparadise 

    holds in her fairest hand what dearest is 

    my fortune’s wheel’s the circle of her eyes 

    whose rolling grace deign once a turn of bliss 

      all my life’s sweet consists in her alone 

      so much i love the most unloving one 





iii



    and yet i cannot reprehend the flight

    or blame th’ attempt presuming so to soar 

    the mounting venture for a high delight

    did make the honour of the fall the more 

    for who gets wealth  that puts not from the shore 

    danger hath honour  great designs their fame 

    glory doth follow  courage goes before 

    and though th’ event oft answers not the same  

    suffice that high attempts have never shame 

    the mean observer  whom base safety keeps 

    lives without honour  dies without a name 

    and in eternal darkness ever sleeps   

      and therefore   delia   ’tis to me no blot

      to have attempted  tho’ attain’d thee not 





iv



    when men shall find thy flow’r  thy glory  pass 

    and thou with careful brow  sitting alone 

    receivèd hast this message from thy glass 

    that tells the truth and says that  all is gone  

    fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou mad’st 

    though spent thy flame  in me the heat remaining 

    i that have loved thee thus before thou fad’st  

    my faith shall wax  when thou art in thy waning 

    the world shall find this miracle in me 

    that fire can burn when all the matter’s spent 

    then what my faith hath been thyself shalt see 

    and that thou wast unkind thou may’st repent   

      thou may’st repent that thou hast scorn’d my tears 

      when winter snows upon thy sable hairs 





v



    beauty  sweet love  is like the morning dew 

    whose short refresh upon the tender green

    cheers for a time  but till the sun doth show 

    and straight ’tis gone as it had never been 

    soon doth it fade that makes the fairest flourish 

    short is the glory of the blushing rose 

    the hue which thou so carefully dost nourish 

    yet which at length thou must be forced to lose 

    when thou  surcharged with burthen of thy years 

    shalt bend thy wrinkles homeward to the earth 

    and that  in beauty’s lease expired  appears

    the date of age  the calends of our death  

      but ah  no more   this must not be foretold 

      for women grieve to think they must be old 





vi



    i must not grieve my love  whose eyes would read

    lines of delight  whereon her youth might smile 

    flowers have time before they come to seed 

    and she is young  and now must sport the while 

    and sport  sweet maid  in season of these years 

    and learn to gather flowers before they wither 

    and where the sweetest blossom first appears 

    let love and youth conduct thy pleasures thither 

    lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air 

    and calm the tempest which my sighs do raise 

    pity and smiles do best become the fair 

    pity and smiles must only yield thee praise 

      make me to say when all my griefs are gone 

      happy the heart that sighed for such a one 





vii



    let others sing of knights and paladines

    in agèd accents and untimely words 

    paint shadows in imaginary lines 

    which well the reach of their high wit records 

    but i must sing of thee  and those fair eyes

    authentic shall my verse in time to come 

    when yet th’ unborn shall say   lo  where she lies  

     whose beauty made him speak  that else was dumb  

    these are the arcs  the trophies i erect 

    that fortify thy name against old age 

    and these thy sacred virtues must protect

    against the dark  and time’s consuming rage 

      though th’ error of my youth in them appear 

      suffice  they show i lived  and loved thee dear

 116    to his coy love 



    i pray thee  leave  love me no more 

      call home the heart you gave me 

    i but in vain that saint adore

      that can but will not save me 

    these poor half kisses kill me quite  

      was ever man thus servèd 

    amidst an ocean of delight

      for pleasure to be starvèd 



    show me no more those snowy breasts

      with azure riverets branchèd 

    where  whilst mine eye with plenty feasts 

      yet is my thirst not stanchèd 

    o tantalus  thy pains ne’er tell 

      by me thou art prevented 

    ’tis nothing to be plagued in hell 

      but thus in heaven tormented 



    clip me no more in those dear arms 

      nor thy life’s comfort call me 

    o these are but too powerful charms 

      and do but more enthral me 

    but see how patient i am grown

      in all this coil about thee 

    come  nice thing  let my heart alone 

      i cannot live without thee 





 117    the parting 



    since there’s no help  come let us kiss and part  

    nay  i have done  you get no more of me 

    and i am glad  yea  glad with all my heart 

    that thus so cleanly i myself can free 

    shake hands for ever  cancel all our vows 

    and when we meet at any time again 

    be it not seen in either of our brows

    that we one jot of former love retain 

    now at the last gasp of love’s latest breath 

    when  his pulse failing  passion speechless lies 

    when faith is kneeling by his bed of death 

    and innocence is closing up his eyes 

       now if thou wouldst  when all have given him over 

      from death to life thou might’st him yet recover

      all that excelleth 

    by which the muses late

    have for their greater state

      taken their places 

    twisting an anadem

      wherewith to crown her 

    as it belong’d to them

      most to renown her 

             on thy bank  

             in a rank  

             let thy swans sing her

               along let them bring her  



     tagus  and  pactolus 

      are to thee debtor 

    nor for their gold to us

      are they the better 

    henceforth of all the rest

      be thou the river

    which  as the daintiest 

      puts them down ever 

    for as my precious one

      o’er thee doth travel 

    she to pearl paragon

      turneth thy gravel 

                 on thy bank     



    our mournful philomel 

      that rarest tuner 

    henceforth in aperil

      shall wake the sooner 

    and to her shall complain

      from the thick cover 

    redoubling every strain

      over and over 

    for when my love too long

      her chamber keepeth 

    as though it suffer’d wrong 

      the morning weepeth 

                 on thy bank     





    oft have i seen the sun 

      to do her honour 

    fix himself at his noon

      to look upon her 

    and hath gilt every grove 

      every hill near her 

    with his flames from above

      striving to cheer her 

    and when she from his sight

      hath herself turnèd 

    he  as it had been night 

      in clouds hath mournèd 

                 on thy bank     



    the verdant meads are seen 

      when she doth view them 

    in fresh and gallant green

      straight to renew them 

    and every little grass

      broad itself spreadeth 

    proud that this bonny lass

      upon it treadeth 

    nor flower is so sweet

      in this large cincture 

    but it upon her feet

      leaveth some tincture 

                 on thy bank     



    the fishes in the flood 

      when she doth angle 

    for the hook strive a good

      them to entangle 

    and leaping on the land 

      from the clear water 

    their scales upon the sand

      lavishly scatter 

    therewith to pave the mould

      whereon she passes 

    so herself to behold

      as in her glasses 

                 on thy bank     



    when she looks out by night 

      the stars stand gazing 

    like comets to our sight

      fearfully blazing 

    as wond’ring at her eyes

      with their much brightness 

    which so amaze the skies 

      dimming their lightness 

    the raging tempests are calm

      when she speaketh 

    such most delightsome balm

      from her lips breaketh 

                 on thy bank     



    in all our  brittany 

      there’s not a fairer 

    nor can you fit any

      should you compare her 

    angels her eyelids keep 

      all hearts surprising 

    which look whilst she doth sleep

      like the sun’s rising 

    she alone of her kind

      knoweth true measure 

    and her unmatchèd mind

      is heaven’s treasure 

                 on thy bank     





    fair  dove  and  darwen  clear 

      boast ye your beauties 

    to  trent  your mistress here

      yet pay your duties 

    my love was higher born

      tow’rds the full fountains 

    yet she doth moorland scorn

      and the  peak  mountains 

    nor would she none should dream

      where she abideth 

    humble as is the stream

      which by her slideth 

                 on thy bank     



    yet my poor rustic muse

      nothing can move her 

    nor the means i can use 

      though her true lover 

    many a long winter’s night

      have i waked for her 

    yet this my piteous plight

      nothing can stir her 

    all thy sands  silver  trent  

      down to the  humber  

    the sighs that i have spent

      never can number 

             on thy bank  

             in a rank  

             let thy swans sing her  

           and with their music 

               along let them bring her

    fair stood the wind for france

    when we our sails advance 

    nor now to prove our chance

        longer will tarry 

    but putting to the main 

    at caux  the mouth of seine 

    with all his martial train

        landed king harry 



    and taking many a fort 

    furnish’d in warlike sort 

    marcheth tow’rds agincourt

        in happy hour 

    skirmishing day by day

    with those that stopp’d his way 

    where the french gen’ral lay

        with all his power 



    which  in his height of pride 

    king henry to deride 

    his ransom to provide

        unto him sending 

    which he neglects the while

    as from a nation vile 

    yet with an angry smile

        their fall portending 



    and turning to his men 

    quoth our brave henry then 

    ‘though they to one be ten

        be not amazèd 

    yet have we well begun 

    battles so bravely won

    have ever to the sun

        by fame been raisèd 



    ‘and for myself  quoth he 

    this my full rest shall be 

    england ne’er mourn for me

        nor more esteem me 

    victor i will remain

    or on this earth lie slain 

    never shall she sustain

        loss to redeem me 



    ‘poitiers and cressy tell 

    when most their pride did swell 

    under our swords they fell 

        no less our skill is

    than when our grandsire great 

    claiming the regal seat 

    by many a warlike feat

        lopp’d the french lilies ’



    the duke of york so dread

    the eager vaward led 

    with the main henry sped

        among his henchmen 

    excester had the rear 

    a braver man not there 

    o lord  how hot they were

        on the false frenchmen 



    they now to fight are gone 

    armour on armour shone 

    drum now to drum did groan 

        to hear was wonder 

    that with the cries they make

    the very earth did shake 

    trumpet to trumpet spake 

        thunder to thunder 



    well it thine age became 

    o noble erpingham 

    which didst the signal aim

        to our hid forces 

    when from a meadow by 

    like a storm suddenly

    the english archery

        stuck the french horses 



    with spanish yew so strong 

    arrows a cloth yard long

    that like to serpents stung 

        piercing the weather 

    none from his fellow starts 

    but playing manly parts 

    and like true english hearts

        stuck close together 



    when down their bows they threw 

    and forth their bilbos drew 

    and on the french they flew 

        not one was tardy 

    arms were from shoulders sent 

    scalps to the teeth were rent 

    down the french peasants went  

        our men were hardy 



    this while our noble king 

    his broadsword brandishing 



     bilbos  swords  from bilboa 



    down the french host did ding

        as to o’erwhelm it 

    and many a deep wound lent 

    his arms with blood besprent 

    and many a cruel dent

        bruisèd his helmet 



    gloster  that duke so good 

    next of the royal blood 

    for famous england stood

        with his brave brother 

    clarence  in steel so bright 

    though but a maiden knight 

    yet in that furious fight

        scarce such another 



    warwick in blood did wade 

    oxford the foe invade 

    and cruel slaughter made

        still as they ran up 

    suffolk his axe did ply 

    beaumont and willoughby

    bare them right doughtily 

        ferrers and fanhope 



    upon saint crispin’s day

    fought was this noble fray 

    which fame did not delay

        to england to carry 

    o when shall english men

    with such acts fill a pen 

    or england breed again

    you brave heroic minds

      worthy your country’s name

        go and subdue 

    whilst loitering hinds

      lurk here at home with shame 



    britons  you stay too long 

      quickly aboard bestow you 

        and with a merry gale

        swell your stretch’d sail

    with vows as strong

      as the winds that blow you 



    your course securely steer 

      west and by south forth keep 

        rocks  lee shores  nor shoals

        when eolus scowls

    you need not fear 

      so absolute the deep 



    and cheerfully at sea

      success you still entice

        to get the pearl and gold 

        and ours to hold

     virginia  

      earth’s only paradise 



    where nature hath in store

      fowl  venison  and fish 

        and the fruitfull’st soil

        without your toil

    three harvests more 

      all greater than your wish 





    and the ambitious vine

      crowns with his purple mass

        the cedar reaching high

        to kiss the sky 

    the cypress  pine 

      and useful sassafras 



    to whom the golden age

      still nature’s laws doth give 

        no other cares attend 

        but them to defend

    from winter’s rage 

      that long there doth not live 



    when as the luscious smell

      of that delicious land

        above the seas that flows

        the clear wind throws 

    your hearts to swell

      approaching the dear strand 



    in kenning of the shore

       thanks to god first given 

        o you the happiest men 

        be frolic then 

    let cannons roar 

      frighting the wide heaven 



    and in regions far 

      such heroes bring ye forth

        as those from whom we came 

        and plant our name

    under that star

      not known unto our north 





    and as there plenty grows

      of laurel everywhere  

        apollo’s sacred tree  

        you it may see

    a poet’s brows

      to crown  that may sing there 



    thy  voyages  attend 

      industrious hakluyt 

        whose reading shall inflame

        men to seek fame 

    and much commend

      to after times thy wit

 121    the passionate shepherd to his love 



    come live with me and be my love 

    and we will all the pleasures prove

    that hills and valleys  dales and fields

    or woods or steepy mountain yields 



    and we will sit upon the rocks 

    and see the shepherds feed their flocks

    by shallow rivers  to whose falls

    melodious birds sing madrigals 



    and i will make thee beds of roses

    and a thousand fragrant posies 

    a cap of flowers  and a kirtle

    embroider’d all with leaves of myrtle 





    a gown made of the finest wool

    which from our pretty lambs we pull 

    fair linèd slippers for the cold 

    with buckles of the purest gold 



    a belt of straw and ivy buds

    with coral clasps and amber studs 

    and if these pleasures may thee move 

    come live with me and be my love 



    the shepherd swains shall dance and sing

    for thy delight each may morning 

    if these delights thy mind may move 

    then live with me and be my love 





 122    her reply 



 written by sir walter raleigh 



    if all the world and love were young 

    and truth in every shepherd’s tongue 

    these pretty pleasures might me move

    to live with thee and be thy love 



    but time drives flocks from field to fold 

    when rivers rage and rocks grow cold 

    and philomel becometh dumb 

    the rest complains of cares to come 



    the flowers do fade  and wanton fields

    to wayward winter reckoning yields 

    a honey tongue  a heart of gall 

    is fancy’s spring  but sorrow’s fall 





    thy gowns  thy shoes  thy beds of roses 

    thy cap  thy kirtle  and thy posies 

    soon break  soon wither  soon forgotten 

    in folly ripe  in reason rotten 



    thy belt of straw and ivy buds 

    thy coral clasps and amber studs   

    all these in me no means can move

    to come to thee and be thy love 



    but could youth last  and love still breed 

    had joys no date  nor age no need 

    then these delights my mind might move

    to live with thee and be thy love

    when roasted crabs hiss in the bowl

      save the eagle  feather’d king 

    keep the obsequy so strict 



    let the priest in surplice white

      that defunctive music can 

      be the death divining swan

      love and constancy is dead 

      phœnix and the turtle fled

    in a mutual flame from hence 



    so they loved  as love in twain

      had the essence but in one 

      two distincts  division none 

    number there in love was slain 



     can  knows 



    hearts remote  yet not asunder 

      distance  and no space was seen

      ’twixt the turtle and his queen 

    but in them it were a wonder 



    so between them love did shine 

      that the turtle saw his right

      flaming in the phœnix’ sight 

    either was the other’s mine 



    property was thus appall’d 

      that the self was not the same 

      single nature’s double name

    neither two nor one was call’d 



    reason  in itself confounded 

      saw division grow together 

      to themselves yet either neither 

    simple were so well compounded 



    that it cried  ‘how true a twain

      seemeth this concordant one 

      love hath reason  reason none

    if what parts can so remain ’



    whereupon it made this threne

      to the phœnix and the dove 

      co supremes and stars of love 

    as chorus to their tragic scene 





 threnos 



    beauty  truth  and rarity 

    grace in all simplicity 

    here enclosed in cinders lie 





    death is now the phœnix’ nest 

    and the turtle’s loyal breast

    to eternity doth rest 



    leaving no posterity 

    ’twas not their infirmity 

    it was married chastity 



    truth may seem  but cannot be

 145    i 



    shall i compare thee to a summer’s day 

    thou art more lovely and more temperate 

    rough winds do shake the darling buds of may 

    and summer’s lease hath all too short a date 

    sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines 

    and often is his gold complexion dimm’d 

    and every fair from fair sometime declines 

    by chance or nature’s changing course untrimm’d 

    but thy eternal summer shall not fade

    nor lose possession of that fair thou owest 

    nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade 

    when in eternal lines to time thou growest 

      so long as men can breathe  or eyes can see 

      so long lives this  and this gives life to thee 





 146    ii 



    when  in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes 

    i all alone beweep my outcast state 

    and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries 

    and look upon myself  and curse my fate 

    wishing me like to one more rich in hope 

    featured like him  like him with friends possest 

    desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope 

    with what i most enjoy contented least 

    yet in these thoughts myself almost despising  

    haply i think on thee  and then my state 

    like to the lark at break of day arising

    from sullen earth  sings hymns at heaven’s gate 

      for thy sweet love rememb’red such wealth brings

      that then i scorn to change my state with kings 





 147    iii 



    when to the sessions of sweet silent thought

    i summon up remembrance of things past 

    i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought 

    and with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste 

    then can i drown an eye  unused to flow 

    for precious friends hid in death’s dateless night 

    and weep afresh love’s long since cancell’d woe 

    and moan th’ expense of many a vanish’d sight 

    then can i grieve at grievances foregone 

    and heavily from woe to woe tell o’er

    the sad account of fore bemoanèd moan 

    which i new pay as if not paid before 

      but if the while i think on thee  dear friend 

      all losses are restored and sorrows end 





 148    iv 



    thy bosom is endearèd with all hearts

    which i  by lacking  have supposèd dead 

    and there reigns love  and all love’s loving parts 

    and all those friends which i thought burièd 

    how many a holy and obsequious tear

    hath dear religious love stol’n from mine eye 

    as interest of the dead   which now appear

    but things removed that hidden in thee lie 

    thou art the grave where buried love doth live 

    hung with the trophies of my lovers gone 

    who all their parts of me to thee did give 

      that due of many now is thine alone 

      their images i loved i view in thee 

      and thou  all they  hast all the all of me 





 149    v 



    what is your substance  whereof are you made 

    that millions of strange shadows on you tend 

    since every one hath  every one  one shade 

    and you  but one  can every shadow lend 

    describe adonis  and the counterfeit

    is poorly imitated after you 

    on helen’s cheek all art of beauty set 

    and you in grecian tires are painted new 

    speak of the spring and foison of the year 

    the one doth shadow of your beauty show 

    the other as your bounty doth appear 

    and you in every blessèd shape we know 

      in all external grace you have some part 

      but you like none  none you  for constant heart 



      149   foison  plenty 





 150    vi 



    o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem

    by that sweet ornament which truth doth give 

    the rose looks fair  but fairer we it deem

    for that sweet odour which doth in it live 

    the canker blooms have full as deep a dye

    as the perfumèd tincture of the roses 

    hang on such thorns  and play as wantonly

    when summer’s breath their maskèd buds discloses 

    but  for their virtue only is their show  

    they live unwoo’d and unrespected fade 

    die to themselves  sweet roses do not so 

    of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made 

      and so of you  beauteous and lovely youth 

      when that shall vade  my verse distils your truth 





 151    vii 



    being your slave  what should i do but tend

    upon the hours and times of your desire 

    i have no precious time at all to spend 

    nor services to do  till you require 

    nor dare i chide the world without end hour

    whilst i  my sovereign  watch the clock for you 

    nor think the bitterness of absence sour

    when you have bid your servant once adieu 

    nor dare i question with my jealous thought

    where you may be  or your affairs suppose 

    but  like a sad slave  stay and think of nought

    save  where you are how happy you make those 

      so true a fool is love  that in your will 

      though you do any thing  he thinks no ill 





 152    viii 



    that time of year thou may’st in me behold

    when yellow leaves  or none  or few  do hang

    upon those boughs which shake against the cold  

    bare ruin’d choirs where late the sweet birds sang 

    in me thou see’st the twilight of such day

    as after sunset fadeth in the west 

    which by and by black night doth take away 

    death’s second self  that seals up all in rest 

    in me thou see’st the glowing of such fire

    that on the ashes of his youth doth lie 

    as the death bed whereon it must expire 

    consumed with that which it was nourish’d by 

      this thou perceiv’st  which makes thy love more strong

      to love that well which thou must leave ere long 





 153    ix 



    farewell  thou art too dear for my possessing 

    and like enough thou know’st thy estimate 

    the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing 

    my bonds in thee are all determinate 

    for how do i hold thee but by thy granting 

    and for that riches where is my deserving 

    the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting 

    and so my patent back again is swerving 

    thyself thou gav’st  thy own worth then not knowing 

    or me  to whom thou gav’st it  else mistaking 

    so thy great gift  upon misprision growing 

    comes home again  on better judgment making 

      thus have i had thee  as a dream doth flatter

      in sleep a king  but waking  no such matter 





 154    x 



    then hate me when thou wilt  if ever  now 

    now  while the world is bent my deeds to cross 

    join with the spite of fortune  make me bow 

    and do not drop in for an after loss 

    ah  do not  when my heart hath ’scaped this sorrow 

    come in the rearward of a conquered woe 

    give not a windy night a rainy morrow 

    to linger out a purposed overthrow 

    if thou wilt leave me  do not leave me last 

    when other petty griefs have done their spite 

    but in the onset come  so shall i taste

    at first the very worst of fortune’s might 

      and other strains of woe  which now seem woe 

      compared with loss of thee will not seem so 





 155    xi 



    they that have power to hurt and will do none 

    that do not do the thing they most do show 

    who  moving others  are themselves as stone 

    unmovèd  cold  and to temptation slow  

    they rightly do inherit heaven’s graces 

    and husband nature’s riches from expense 

    they are the lords and owners of their faces 

    others  but stewards of their excellence 

    the summer’s flower is to the summer sweet 

    though to itself it only live and die 

    but if that flower with base infection meet 

    the basest weed outbraves his dignity 

      for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds 

      lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds 





 156    xii 



    how like a winter hath my absence been

    from thee  the pleasure of the fleeting year 

    what freezings have i felt  what dark days seen 

    what old december’s bareness everywhere 

    and yet this time removed was summer’s time 

    the teeming autumn  big with rich increase 

    bearing the wanton burden of the prime

    like widow’d wombs after their lord’s decease 

    yet this abundant issue seem’d to me

    but hope of orphans and unfather’d fruit 

    for summer and his pleasures wait on thee 

    and  thou away  the very birds are mute 

      or if they sing  ’tis with so dull a cheer

      that leaves look pale  dreading the winter’s near 





 157    xiii 



    from you have i been absent in the spring 

    when proud pied april  dress’d in all his trim 

    hath put a spirit of youth in everything 

    that heavy saturn laugh’d and leap’d with him 

    yet nor the lays of birds  nor the sweet smell

    of different flowers in odour and in hue 

    could make me any summer’s story tell 

    or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew 

    nor did i wonder at the lily’s white 

    nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose 

    they were but sweet  but figures of delight 

    drawn after you  you pattern of all those 

      yet seem’d it winter still  and  you away 

      as with your shadow i with these did play 





 158    xiv 



    my love is strengthen’d  though more weak in seeming 

    i love not less  though less the show appear 

    that love is merchandised whose rich esteeming

    the owner’s tongue doth publish everywhere 

    our love was new  and then but in the spring 

    when i was wont to greet it with my lays 

    as philomel in summer’s front doth sing

    and stops her pipe in growth of riper days 

    not that the summer is less pleasant now

    than when her mournful hymns did hush the night 

    but that wild music burthens every bough 

    and sweets grown common lose their dear delight 

      therefore  like her  i sometime hold my tongue 

      because i would not dull you with my song 





 159    xv 



    to me  fair friend  you never can be old 

    for as you were when first your eye i eyed 

    such seems your beauty still  three winters cold

    have from the forests shook three summers’ pride 

    three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn’d

    in process of the seasons have i seen 

    three april perfumes in three hot junes burn’d 

    since first i saw you fresh  which yet are green 

    ah  yet doth beauty  like a dial hand 

    steal from his figure  and no pace perceived 

    so your sweet hue  which methinks still doth stand 

    hath motion  and mine eye may be deceived 

      for fear of which  hear this  thou age unbred 

      ere you were born was beauty’s summer dead 





 160    xvi 



    when in the chronicle of wasted time

    i see descriptions of the fairest wights 

    and beauty making beautiful old rime

    in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights 

    then  in the blazon of sweet beauty’s best 

    of hand  of foot  of lip  of eye  of brow 

    i see their antique pen would have exprest

    even such a beauty as you master now 

    so all their praises are but prophecies

    of this our time  all you prefiguring 

    and for they look’d but with divining eyes 

    they had not skill enough your worth to sing 

      for we  which now behold these present days 

      have eyes to wonder  but lack tongues to praise 





 161    xvii 



    o never say that i was false of heart 

    though absence seem’d my flame to qualify 

    as easy might i from myself depart 

    as from my soul  which in thy breast doth lie 

    that is my home of love  if i have ranged 

    like him that travels i return again 

    just to the time  not with the time exchanged 

    so that myself bring water for my stain 

    never believe  though in my nature reign’d

    all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood 

    that it could so prepost’rously be stain’d 

    to leave for nothing all thy sum of good 

      for nothing this wide universe i call 

      save thou  my rose  in it thou art my all 





 162    xviii 



    let me not to the marriage of true minds

    admit impediments  love is not love

    which alters when it alteration finds 

    or bends with the remover to remove 

    o  no  it is an ever fixèd mark 

    that looks on tempests and is never shaken 

    it is the star to every wand’ring bark 

    whose worth’s unknown  although his height be taken 

    love’s not time’s fool  though rosy lips and cheeks

    within his bending sickle’s compass come 

    love alters not with his brief hours and weeks 

    but bears it out even to the edge of doom   

      if this be error and upon me proved 

      i never writ  nor no man ever loved 





 163    xix 



    th’ expense of spirit in a waste of shame

    is lust in action  and till action  lust

    is perjured  murderous  bloody  full of blame 

    savage  extreme  rude  cruel  not to trust 

    enjoy’d no sooner but despisèd straight 

    past reason hunted  and  no sooner had 

    past reason hated  as a swallow’d bait

    on purpose laid to make the taker mad 

    mad in pursuit  and in possession so 

    had  having  and in quest to have  extreme 

    a bliss in proof  and proved  a very woe 

    before  a joy proposed  behind  a dream 

      all this the world well knows  yet none knows well

      to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell 





 164    xx 



    poor soul  the centre of my sinful earth  

    my sinful earth these rebel powers array  

    why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth 

    painting thy outward walls so costly gay 

    why so large cost  having so short a lease 

    dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend 

    shall worms  inheritors of this excess 

    eat up thy charge  is this thy body’s end 

    then  soul  live thou upon thy servant’s loss 

    and let that pine to aggravate thy store 

    buy terms divine in selling hours of dross 

    within be fed  without be rich no more 

      so shalt thou feed on death  that feeds on men 

      and death once dead  there’s no more dying then

    upon my lap my sovereign sits

    meantime his love maintains my life

    and gives my sense her rest 

        sing lullaby  my little boy 

        sing lullaby  mine only joy 



    when thou hast taken thy repast 

    repose  my babe  on me 

    so may thy mother and thy nurse

    thy cradle also be 

        sing lullaby  my little boy 

        sing lullaby  mine only joy 





    i grieve that duty doth not work

    all that my wishing would

        sing lullaby  my little boy 

        sing lullaby  mine only joy 



    yet as i am  and as i may 

    i must and will be thine 

    though all too little for thyself

    vouchsafing to be mine 

        sing lullaby  my little boy 

        sing lullaby  mine only joy

    adieu  farewell earth’s bliss 

    this world uncertain is 

    fond are life’s lustful joys 

    death proves them all but toys 

    none from his darts can fly 

    i am sick  i must die  

           lord  have mercy on us  



    rich men  trust not in wealth 

    gold cannot buy you health 

    physic himself must fade 

    all things to end are made 

    the plague full swift goes by 

    i am sick  i must die  

           lord  have mercy on us  



    beauty is but a flower

    which wrinkles will devour 

    brightness falls from the air 

    queens have died young and fair 

    dust hath closed helen’s eye 

    i am sick  i must die  

           lord  have mercy on us  



    strength stoops unto the grave 

    worms feed on hector brave 

    swords may not fight with fate 

    earth still holds ope her gate 

     come  come   the bells do cry 

    i am sick  i must die  

           lord  have mercy on us  





    wit with his wantonness

    tasteth death’s bitterness 

    hell’s executioner

    hath no ears for to hear

    what vain art can reply 

    i am sick  i must die  

           lord  have mercy on us  



    haste therefore each degree

    to welcome destiny 

    heaven is our heritage 

    earth but a player’s stage 

    mount we unto the sky 

    i am sick  i must die  

           lord  have mercy on us

    there is a garden in her face

      where roses and white lilies blow 

    a heavenly paradise is that place 

      wherein all pleasant fruits do flow 

        there cherries grow which none may buy

        till ‘cherry ripe’ themselves do cry

      her brows like bended bows do stand 

    threat’ning with piercing frowns to kill

    sing thou smoothly with thy beauty’s

    silent music  either other

            sweetly gracing 



      lovely forms do flow

    from concent divinely framèd 

    heaven is music  and thy beauty’s

            birth is heavenly 



      these dull notes we sing

    discords need for helps to grace them 

    only beauty purely loving

            knows no discord 



      but still moves delight 

    like clear springs renew’d by flowing 

    ever perfect  ever in them 

            selves eternal 





 devotion 



 170    i 



    follow thy fair sun  unhappy shadow 

      though thou be black as night 

      and she made all of light 

    yet follow thy fair sun  unhappy shadow 





    follow her  whose light thy light depriveth 

      though here thou liv’st disgraced 

      and she in heaven is placed 

    yet follow her whose light the world reviveth 



    follow those pure beams  whose beauty burneth 

      that so have scorchèd thee

      as thou still black must be 

    till her kind beams thy black to brightness turneth 



    follow her  while yet her glory shineth 

      there comes a luckless night

      that will dim all her light 

    and this the black unhappy shade divineth 



    follow still  since so thy fates ordainèd 

      the sun must have his shade 

      till both at once do fade   

    the sun still proud  the shadow still disdainèd 





 171    ii 



    follow your saint  follow with accents sweet 

    haste you  sad notes  fall at her flying feet 

    there  wrapt in cloud of sorrow  pity move 

    and tell the ravisher of my soul i perish for her love 

    but if she scorns my never ceasing pain 

    then burst with sighing in her sight  and ne’er return again 



    all that i sung still to her praise did tend 

    still she was first  still she my songs did end 

    yet she my love and music both doth fly 

    the music that her echo is and beauty’s sympathy 

    then let my notes pursue her scornful flight 

    it shall suffice that they were breathed and died for her delight 





 172    vobiscum est iope 



    when thou must home to shades of underground 

    and there arrived  a new admirèd guest 

    the beauteous spirits do engirt thee round 

    white iope  blithe helen  and the rest 

    to hear the stories of thy finish’d love

    from that smooth tongue whose music hell can move 



    then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights 

    of masques and revels which sweet youth did make 

    of tourneys and great challenges of knights 

    and all these triumphs for thy beauty’s sake 

    when thou hast told these honours done to thee 

    then tell  o tell  how thou didst murder me 





 173    hymn in praise of neptune 



    of neptune’s empire let us sing 

    at whose command the waves obey 

    to whom the rivers tribute pay 

    down the high mountains sliding 

    to whom the scaly nation yields

    homage for the crystal fields

        wherein they dwell 

    and every sea dog pays a gem

    yearly out of his wat’ry cell

    to deck great neptune’s diadem 



    the tritons dancing in a ring

    before his palace gates do make

    the water with their echoes quake 

    like the great thunder sounding 

    the sea nymphs chant their accents shrill 

    and the sirens  taught to kill

        with their sweet voice 

    make ev’ry echoing rock reply

    unto their gentle murmuring noise

    the praise of neptune’s empery 





 174    winter nights 



          now winter nights enlarge

            the number of their hours 

          and clouds their storms discharge

            upon the airy towers 

          let now the chimneys blaze

            and cups o’erflow with wine 

          let well tuned words amaze

            with harmony divine 

          now yellow waxen lights

            shall wait on honey love 

    while youthful revels  masques  and courtly sights

            sleep’s leaden spells remove 



          this time doth well dispense

            with lovers’ long discourse 

          much speech hath some defence

            though beauty no remorse 

          all do not all things well 

            some measures comely tread 

          some knotted riddles tell 

            some poems smoothly read 

          the summer hath his joys 

            and winter his delights 

    though love and all his pleasures are but toys 

            they shorten tedious nights 





 175    integer vitae 



    the man of life upright 

      whose guiltless heart is free

    from all dishonest deeds 

      or thought of vanity 



    the man whose silent days

      in harmless joys are spent 

    whom hopes cannot delude 

      nor sorrow discontent 



    that man needs neither towers

      nor armour for defence 

    nor secret vaults to fly

      from thunder’s violence 



    he only can behold

      with unaffrighted eyes

    the horrors of the deep

      and terrors of the skies 



    thus  scorning all the cares

      that fate or fortune brings 

    he makes the heaven his book 

      his wisdom heavenly things 



    good thoughts his only friends 

      his wealth a well spent age 

    the earth his sober inn

      and quiet pilgrimage 





 176    o come quickly  



    never weather beaten sail more willing bent to shore 

    never tirèd pilgrim’s limbs affected slumber more 

    than my wearied sprite now longs to fly out of my troubled breast 

    o come quickly  sweetest lord  and take my soul to rest 



    ever blooming are the joys of heaven’s high paradise 

    cold age deafs not there our ears nor vapour dims our eyes 

    glory there the sun outshines  whose beams the blessèd only see 

    o come quickly  glorious lord  and raise my sprite to thee

 177    a nosegay 



    say  crimson rose and dainty daffodil 

                with violet blue 

    since you have seen the beauty of my saint 

                and eke her view 

    did not her sight  fair sight   you lonely fill 

                with sweet delight

    of goddess’ grace and angels’ sacred teint

                in fine  most bright 



    say  golden primrose  sanguine cowslip fair 

                with pink most fine 

    since you beheld the visage of my dear 

                and eyes divine 



      177   teint  tint  hue 



    did not her globy front  and glistering hair 

                with cheeks most sweet 

    so gloriously like damask flowers appear 

                the gods to greet 



    say  snow white lily  speckled gillyflower 

                with daisy gay 

    since you have viewed the queen of my desire 

                in her array 

    did not her ivory paps  fair venus’ bower 

                with heavenly glee 

    a juno’s grace  conjure you to require

                her face to see 



    say rose  say daffodil  and violet blue 

                with primrose fair 

    since ye have seen my nymph’s sweet dainty face

                and gesture rare 

    did not  bright cowslip  blooming pink  her view

                 white lily  shine  

     ah  gillyflower  ah daisy   with a grace

    you meaner beauties of the night 

      that poorly satisfy our eyes

    more by your number than your light 

      you common people of the skies 

      what are you when the moon shall rise 





    you curious chanters of the wood 

      that warble forth dime nature’s lays 

    thinking your passions understood

      by your weak accents  what’s your praise

      when philomel her voice shall raise 



    you violets that first appear 

      by your pure purple mantles known

    like the proud virgins of the year 

      as if the spring were all your own 

      what are you when the rose is blown 



    so  when my mistress shall be seen

      in form and beauty of her mind 

    by virtue first  then choice  a queen 

      tell me  if she were not design’d

      th’ eclipse and glory of her kind 





 179    the character of a happy life 



    how happy is he born and taught

    that serveth not another’s will 

    whose armour is his honest thought 

    and simple truth his utmost skill 



    whose passions not his masters are 

    whose soul is still prepared for death 

    untied unto the world by care

    of public fame or private breath 



    who envies none that chance doth raise 

    nor vice  who never understood

    how deepest wounds are given by praise 

    nor rules of state  but rules of good 

    who hath his life from rumours freed 

    whose conscience is his strong retreat 

    whose state can neither flatterers feed 

    nor ruin make oppressors great 



    who god doth late and early pray

    more of his grace than gifts to lend 

    and entertains the harmless day

    with a religious book or friend 



      this man is freed from servile bands

    of hope to rise or fear to fall 

    lord of himself  though not of lands 

    and having nothing  yet hath all

 181    man 



    i know my soul hath power to know all things 

    yet she is blind and ignorant in all 

    i know i’m one of nature’s little kings 

    yet to the least and vilest things am thrall 





    i know my life’s a pain and but a span 

    i know my sense is mock’d in everything 

    and  to conclude  i know myself a man  

    which is a proud and yet a wretched thing 









sir robert ayton



1570 1638





 182    to his forsaken mistress 



    i do confess thou’rt smooth and fair 

      and i might have gone near to love thee 

    had i not found the slightest prayer

      that lips could move  had power to move thee 

    but i can let thee now alone

    as worthy to be loved by none 



    i do confess thou’rt sweet  yet find

      thee such an unthrift of thy sweets 

    thy favours are but like the wind

      that kisseth everything it meets 

    and since thou canst with more than one 

    thou’rt worthy to be kiss’d by none 



    the morning rose that untouch’d stands

      arm’d with her briers  how sweet she smells 

    but pluck’d and strain’d through ruder hands 

      her sweets no longer with her dwells 

    but scent and beauty both are gone 

    and leaves fall from her  one by one 



    such fate ere long will thee betide

      when thou hast handled been awhile 

    with sere flowers to be thrown aside 

      and i shall sigh  while some will smile 

    to see thy love to every one

    hath brought thee to be loved by none 





 183    to an inconstant one 



    i loved thee once  i’ll love no more  

      thine be the grief as is the blame 

    thou art not what thou wast before 

      what reason i should be the same 

        he that can love unloved again 

        hath better store of love than brain 

      god send me love my debts to pay 

      while unthrifts fool their love away 



    nothing could have my love o’erthrown

      if thou hadst still continued mine 

    yea  if thou hadst remain’d thy own 

      i might perchance have yet been thine 

        but thou thy freedom didst recall

        that it thou might elsewhere enthral 

      and then how could i but disdain

      a captive’s captive to remain 



    when new desires had conquer’d thee

      and changed the object of thy will 

    it had been lethargy in me 

      not constancy  to love thee still 

        yea  it had been a sin to go

        and prostitute affection so 

      since we are taught no prayers to say

      to such as must to others pray 





    yet do thou glory in thy choice  

      thy choice of his good fortune boast 

    i’ll neither grieve nor yet rejoice

      to see him gain what i have lost 

        the height of my disdain shall be

        to laugh at him  to blush for thee 

      to love thee still  but go no more

      a begging at a beggar’s door

 184    hymn to diana 



    queen and huntress  chaste and fair 

      now the sun is laid to sleep 

    seated in thy silver chair 

      state in wonted manner keep 

        hesperus entreats thy light 

        goddess excellently bright 



    earth  let not thy envious shade

      dare itself to interpose 

    cynthia’s shining orb was made

      heaven to clear when day did close 

        bless us then with wishèd sight 

        goddess excellently bright 



    lay thy bow of pearl apart 

      and thy crystal shining quiver 

    give unto the flying hart

      space to breathe  how short soever 

        thou that mak’st a day of night  

        goddess excellently bright 





 185    to celia 



    drink to me only with thine eyes 

      and i will pledge with mine 

    or leave a kiss but in the cup

      and i’ll not look for wine 

    the thirst that from the soul doth rise

      doth ask a drink divine 

    but might i of jove’s nectar sup 

      i would not change for thine 



    i sent thee late a rosy wreath 

      not so much honouring thee

    as giving it a hope that there

      it could not wither’d be 

    but thou thereon didst only breathe 

      and sent’st it back to me 

    since when it grows  and smells  i swear 

      not of itself but thee 





 186    simplex munditiis 



    still to be neat  still to be drest 

    as you were going to a feast 

    still to be powder’d  still perfumed 

    lady  it is to be presumed 

    though art’s hid causes are not found 

    all is not sweet  all is not sound 



    give me a look  give me a face

    that makes simplicity a grace 

    robes loosely flowing  hair as free 

    such sweet neglect more taketh me

    than all th’ adulteries of art 

    they strike mine eyes  but not my heart 





 187    the shadow 



    follow a shadow  it still flies you 

      seem to fly it  it will pursue 

    so court a mistress  she denies you 

      let her alone  she will court you 

        say  are not women truly  then 

        styled but the shadows of us men 



    at morn and even  shades are longest 

      at noon they are or short or none 

    so men at weakest  they are strongest 

      but grant us perfect  they’re not known 

        say  are not women truly  then 

        styled but the shadows of us men 





 188    the triumph 



    see the chariot at hand here of love 

      wherein my lady rideth 

    each that draws is a swan or a dove 

      and well the car love guideth 

    as she goes  all hearts do duty

                unto her beauty 

    and enamour’d do wish  so they might

                but enjoy such a sight 

    that they still were to run by her side 

    through swords  through seas  whither she would ride 



    do but look on her eyes  they do light

      all that love’s world compriseth 

    do but look on her hair  it is bright

      as love’s star when it riseth 

    do but mark  her forehead’s smoother

                than words that soothe her 

    and from her arch’d brows such a grace

                sheds itself through the face 

    as alone there triumphs to the life

    all the gain  all the good  of the elements’ strife 



    have you seen but a bright lily grow

      before rude hands have touch’d it 

    have you mark’d but the fall of the snow

      before the soil hath smutch’d it 

    have you felt the wool of beaver 

                or swan’s down ever 

    o have smelt o’ the bud o’ the brier 

                or the nard in the fire 

    or have tasted the bag of the bee 

    o so white  o so soft  o so sweet is she 





 189    an elegy 



    though beauty be the mark of praise 

      and yours of whom i sing be such

      as not the world can praise too much 

    yet ’tis your virtue now i raise 



    a virtue  like allay so gone

      throughout your form as  though that move

      and draw and conquer all men’s love 

    this subjects you to love of one 



    wherein you triumph yet  because

      ’tis of your flesh  and that you use

      the noblest freedom  not to choose

    against or faith or honour’s laws 



      189   allay  alloy 



    but who should less expect from you 

      in whom alone love lives again 

      by whom he is restored to men 

    and kept and bred and brought up true 



    his falling temples you have rear’d 

      the withered garlands ta’en away 

      his altars kept from that decay

    that envy wish’d  and nature fear’d 



    and on them burn so chaste a flame 

      with so much loyalty’s expense 

      as love to acquit such excellence

    is gone himself into your name 



    and you are he  the deity

      to whom all lovers are design’d

      that would their better objects find

    among which faithful troop am i  



    who as an off’ring at your shrine

      have sung this hymn  and here entreat

      one spark of your diviner heat

    to light upon a love of mine 



    which if it kindle not  but scant

      appear  and that to shortest view 

      yet give me leave to adore in you

    what i in her am grieved to want 





 190    a farewell to the world 



    false world  good night  since thou hast brought

      that hour upon my morn of age 

    henceforth i quit thee from my thought 

      my part is ended on thy stage 





    yes  threaten  do  alas  i fear

      as little as i hope from thee 

    i know thou canst not show nor bear

      more hatred than thou hast to me 



    my tender  first  and simple years

      thou didst abuse and then betray 

    since stir’d’st up jealousies and fears 

      when all the causes were away 



    then in a soil hast planted me

      where breathe the basest of thy fools 

    where envious arts professèd be 

      and pride and ignorance the schools 



    where nothing is examined  weigh’d 

      but as ’tis rumour’d  so believed 

    where every freedom is betray’d 

      and every goodness tax’d or grieved 



    but what we’re born for  we must bear 

      our frail condition it is such

    that what to all may happen here 

      if ’t chance to me  i must not grutch 



    else i my state should much mistake

      to harbour a divided thought

    from all my kind  that  for my sake 

      there should a miracle be wrought 



    no  i do know that i was born

      to age  misfortune  sickness  grief 

    but i will bear these with that scorn

      as shall not need thy false relief 





    nor for my peace will i go far 

      as wanderers do  that still do roam 

    but make my strengths  such as they are 

      here in my bosom  and at home 





 191    the noble balm 



    high spirited friend 

    i send nor balms nor cor’sives to your wound 

            your fate hath found

    a gentler and more agile hand to tend

    the cure of that which is but corporal 

    and doubtful days  which were named critical 

            have made their fairest flight

            and now are out of sight 

    yet doth some wholesome physic for the mind

            wrapp’d in this paper lie 

    which in the taking if you misapply 

            you are unkind 



            your covetous hand 

    happy in that fair honour it hath gain’d 

            must now be rein’d 

    true valour doth her own renown command

    in one full action  nor have you now more

    to do  than be a husband of that store 

            think but how dear you bought

            this fame which you have caught 

    such thoughts will make you more in love with truth 

            ’tis wisdom  and that high 

    for men to use their fortune reverently 

            even in youth

 192    on elizabeth l  h  



    wouldst thou hear what man can say

    in a little  reader  stay 

    underneath this stone doth lie

    as much beauty as could die 

    which in life did harbour give

    to more virtue than doth live 

    if at all she had a fault 

    leave it buried in this vault 

    one name was  elizabeth  

    the other  let it sleep with death 

    fitter  where it died  to tell

 a child of queen elizabeth’s chapel 



    weep with me  all you that read

        this little story 

    and know  for whom a tear you shed

        death’s self is sorry 

    ’twas a child that so did thrive

        in grace and feature 

    as heaven and nature seem’d to strive

        which own’d the creature 

    years he number’d scarce thirteen

        when fates turn’d cruel 

    yet three fill’d zodiacs had he been

        the stage’s jewel 

    and did act  what now we moan 

        old men so duly 

    as sooth the parcae thought him one 

        he play’d so truly 

    so  by error  to his fate

        they all consented 

    but  viewing him since  alas  too late 

        they have repented 

    and have sought  to give new birth 

        in baths to steep him 

    but  being so much too good for earth 

        heaven vows to keep him 





 194    a part of an ode 



 to the immortal memory and friendship of that noble pair  sir lucius

cary and sir h  morison 



          it is not growing like a tree

          in bulk  doth make man better be 

    or standing long an oak  three hundred year 

    to fall a log at last  dry  bald  and sere 

              a lily of a day

              is fairer far in may 

          although it fall and die that night 

          it was the plant and flower of light 

    in small proportions we just beauties see 

    and in short measures  life may perfect be 



          call  noble  lucius   then for wine 

          and let thy looks with gladness shine 

    accept this garland  plant it on thy head 

    and think  nay  know  thy  morison ’s not dead 

              he leap’d the present age 

              possest with holy rage

          to see that bright eternal day

          of which we priests and poets say

    such truths as we expect for happy men 

    and there he lives with memory  and ben



     jonson   who sung this of him  ere he went

              himself to rest 

    or tast a part of that full joy he meant

              to have exprest

          in this bright asterism

          where it were friendship’s schism  

    were not his  lucius  long with us to tarry  

              to separate these twy

              lights  the dioscuri 

    and keep the one half from his  harry  

    but fate doth so alternate the design 

    whilst that in heav’n  this light on earth must shine 



          and shine as you exalted are 

          two names of friendship  but one star 

    of hearts the union  and those not by chance

    made  or indenture  or leased out to advance

              the profits for a time 

              no pleasures vain did chime

          of rimes or riots at your feasts 

          orgies of drink or feign’d protests 

    but simple love of greatness and of good 

    that knits brave minds and manners more than blood 



    this made you first to know the  why 

     you liked   then after  to apply

    that liking  and approach so one the t’other

    till either grew a portion of the other 

              each stylèd by his end

              the copy of his friend 

          you lived to be the great surnames

          and titles by which all made claims

    unto the virtue  nothing perfect done

    but as a  cary  or a  morison  



    and such the force the fair example had

              as they that saw

    the good  and durst not practise it  were glad

              that such a law

          was left yet to mankind 

          where they might read and find

    friendship indeed was written  not in words 

              and with the heart  not pen 

              of two so early men 

    whose lines her rules were and records 

    who  ere the first down bloomed on the chin 

    had sow’d these fruits  and got the harvest in

 195    daybreak 



    stay  o sweet  and do not rise 

      the light that shines comes from thine eyes 

    the day breaks not  it is my heart 

      because that you and i must part 

          stay  or else my joys will die

          and perish in their infancy 





 196    song 



    go and catch a falling star 

      get with child a mandrake root 

    tell me where all past years are 

      or who cleft the devil’s foot 

    teach me to hear mermaids singing 

    or to keep off envy’s stinging 

              and find

              what wind

    serves to advance an honest mind 



    if thou be’st born to strange sights 

      things invisible to see 

    ride ten thousand days and nights

      till age snow white hairs on thee 

    thou  when thou return’st  wilt tell me

    all strange wonders that befell thee 

              and swear

              no where

    lives a woman true and fair 



    if thou find’st one  let me know 

      such a pilgrimage were sweet 

    yet do not  i would not go 

      though at next door we might meet 

    though she were true when you met her 

    and last till you write your letter 

              yet she

              will be

    false  ere i come  to two or three 





 197  



     that time and absence proves 

     rather helps than hurts to loves 



    absence  hear thou my protestation

      against thy strength 

      distance and length 

    do what thou canst for alteration 

      for hearts of truest mettle

      absence doth join and time doth settle 



    who loves a mistress of such quality 

      his mind hath found

      affection’s ground

    beyond time  place  and all mortality 

      to hearts that cannot vary

      absence is present  time doth tarry 



    my senses want their outward motion

      which now within

      reason doth win 

    redoubled by her secret notion 

      like rich men that take pleasure

      in hiding more than handling treasure 



    by absence this good means i gain 

      that i can catch her

      where none can watch her 

    in some close corner of my brain 

      there i embrace and kiss her 

      and so enjoy her and none miss her 





 198    the ecstasy 



    where  like a pillow on a bed 

      a pregnant bank swell’d up  to rest

    the violet’s reclining head 

      sat we two  one another’s best 



    our hands were firmly cèmented

      by a fast balm which thence did spring 

    our eye beams twisted  and did thread

      our eyes upon one double string 



    so to engraft our hands  as yet

      was all the means to make us one 

    and pictures in our eyes to get

      was all our propagation 



    as ’twixt two equal armies fate

      suspends uncertain victory 

    our souls  which to advance their state

      were gone out  hung ’twixt her and me 



    and whilst our souls negotiate there 

      we like sepulchral statues lay 

    all day the same our postures were 

      and we said nothing  all the day 





 199    the dream 



    dear love  for nothing less than thee

    would i have broke this happy dream 

            it was a theme

    for reason  much too strong for fantasy 

    therefore thou waked’st me wisely  yet

    my dream thou brok’st not  but continued’st it 

    thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice

    to make dreams truths and fables histories 

    enter these arms  for since thou thought’st it best

    not to dream all my dream  let’s act the rest 



    as lightning  or a taper’s light 

    thine eyes  and not thy noise  waked me 

            yet i thought thee  

    for thou lov’st truth  an angel  at first sight 

    but when i saw thou saw’st my heart 

    and knew’st my thoughts beyond an angel’s art 

    when thou knew’st what i dreamt  when thou knew’st when

    excess of joy would wake me  and cam’st then 

    i must confess it could not choose but be

    profane to think thee anything but thee 



    coming and staying show’d thee thee 

    but rising makes me doubt that now

            thou art not thou 

    that love is weak where fear’s as strong as he 

    ’tis not all spirit pure and brave

    if mixture it of fear  shame  honour have 

    perchance as torches  which must ready be 

    men light and put out  so thou deal’st with me 

    thou cam’st to kindle  go’st to come  then i

    will dream that hope again  but else would die 





 200    the funeral 



    whoever comes to shroud me  do not harm

            nor question much

    that subtle wreath of hair about mine arm 

    the mystery  the sign you must not touch 

            for ’tis my outward soul 

    viceroy to that which  unto heav’n being gone 

            will leave this to control

    and keep these limbs  her provinces  from dissolution 



    for if the sinewy thread my brain lets fall

            through every part

    can tie those parts  and make me one of all 

    those hairs  which upward grew  and strength and art

            have from a better brain 

    can better do’t  except she meant that i

            by this should know my pain 

    as prisoners then are manacled  when they’re condemn’d to die 



    whate’er she meant by ’t  bury it with me 

            for since i am

    love’s martyr  it might breed idolatry

    if into other hands these reliques came 

            as ’twas humility

    t’ afford to it all that a soul can do 

            so ’tis some bravery

    that  since you would have none of me  i bury some of you 





 201    a hymn to god the father 



    wilt thou forgive that sin where i begun 

      which was my sin  though it were done before 

    wilt thou forgive that sin through which i run 

      and do run still  though still i do deplore 

    when thou hast done  thou hast not done 

            for i have more 





    wilt thou forgive that sin which i have won

      others to sin  and made my sins their door 

    wilt thou forgive that sin which i did shun

      a year or two  but wallow’d in a score 

    when thou hast done  thou hast not done 

            for i have more 



    i have a sin of fear  that when i’ve spun

      my last thread  i shall perish on the shore 

    but swear by thyself that at my death thy son

      shall shine as he shines now and heretofore 

    and having done that  thou hast done 

            i fear no more 





 202    death 



    death  be not proud  though some have callèd thee

    mighty and dreadful  for thou art not so 

    for those whom thou think’st thou dost overthrow

    die not  poor death  nor yet canst thou kill me 

    from rest and sleep  which but thy picture be 

    much pleasure  then from thee much more must flow 

    and soonest our best men with thee do go  

    rest of their bones and souls’ delivery 

    thou’rt slave to fate  chance  kings  and desperate men 

    and dost with poison  war  and sickness dwell 

    and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well

    and better than thy stroke  why swell’st thou then 

      one short sleep past  we wake eternally 

      and death shall be no more  death  thou shalt die

    as it fell upon a day

    in the merry month of may 

    sitting in a pleasant shade

    which a grove of myrtles made 

    beasts did leap and birds did sing 

    trees did grow and plants did spring 

    everything did banish moan

    save the nightingale alone 

    she  poor bird  as all forlorn

    lean’d her breast up till a thorn 

    and there sung the dolefull’st ditty 

    that to hear it was great pity 

     fie  fie  fie   now would she cry 

     tereu  tereu   by and by 

    that to hear her so complain

    scarce i could from tears refrain 

    for her griefs so lively shown

    made me think upon mine own 

    ah  thought i  thou mourn’st in vain 

    none takes pity on thy pain 

    senseless trees they cannot hear thee 

    ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee 

    king pandion he is dead 

    all thy friends are lapp’d in lead 

    all thy fellow birds do sing

    careless of thy sorrowing 

    even so  poor bird  like thee 

    none alive will pity me

    art thou poor  yet hast thou golden slumbers 

              o sweet content 

    art thou rich  yet is thy mind perplex’d 

              o punishment 

    dost thou laugh to see how fools are vex’d

    to add to golden numbers golden numbers 

        o sweet content  o sweet  o sweet content 

    work apace  apace  apace  apace 

    honest labour bears a lovely face 

    then hey nonny nonny  hey nonny nonny 



    canst drink the waters of the crispèd spring 

              o sweet content 

    swim’st thou in wealth  yet sink’st in thine own tears 

              o punishment 

    then he that patiently want’s burden bears 

    no burden bears  but is a king  a king 

        o sweet content  o sweet  o sweet content 

    work apace  apace  apace  apace 

    honest labour bears a lovely face 

    then hey nonny nonny  hey nonny nonny

      with night we banish sorrow 

    sweet air  blow soft  mount  lark  aloft

      to give my love good morrow 

    wings from the wind to please her mind 

      notes from the lark i’ll borrow

      to give my love good morrow 

          to give my love good morrow

          notes from them all i’ll borrow 



    wake from thy nest  robin red breast 

      sing  birds  in every furrow 

    and from each bill let music shrill

      give my fair love good morrow 

    blackbird and thrush in every bush

 206    the message 



    ye little birds that sit and sing

      amidst the shady valleys 

    and see how phillis sweetly walks

      within her garden alleys 

    go  pretty birds  about her bower 

    sing  pretty birds  she may not lower 

    ah me  methinks i see her frown 

        ye pretty wantons  warble 



    go tell her through your chirping bills 

      as you by me are bidden 

    to her is only known my love 

      which from the world is hidden 

    go  pretty birds  and tell her so 

    see that your notes strain not too low 

    for still methinks i see her frown 

        ye pretty wantons  warble 



    go tune your voices’ harmony

      and sing  i am her lover 

    strain loud and sweet  that every note

      with sweet content may move her 

    and she that hath the sweetest voice 

    tell her i will not change my choice 

      yet still methinks i see her frown 

        ye pretty wantons  warble 



    o fly  make haste  see  see  she falls

      into a pretty slumber 

    sing round about her rosy bed

      that waking she may wonder 

    say to her  ’tis her lover true

    that sendeth love to you  to you 

    and when you hear her kind reply 

        return with pleasant warblings

    come  sleep  and with thy sweet deceiving

        lock me in delight awhile 

        let some pleasing dreams beguile

        all my fancies  that from thence

        i may feel an influence

    all my powers of care bereaving 





    though but a shadow  but a sliding 

        let me know some little joy

    come to steal this night away

      till the rites of love are ended

      welcome  light  of all befriended 



    pace out  you watery powers below 

            let your feet 

    like the galleys when they row

 210    hymn to pan 



    sing his praises that doth keep

      our flocks from harm 

    pan  the father of our sheep 

      and arm in arm

    tread we softly in a round 

    whilst the hollow neighbouring ground

    fills the music with her sound 



    pan  o great god pan  to thee

      thus do we sing 

    thou who keep’st us chaste and free

      as the young spring 

    ever be thy honour spoke

    from that place the morn is broke

    to that place day doth unyoke 





 211    away  delights 



    away  delights  go seek some other dwelling 

              for i must die 

    farewell  false love  thy tongue is ever telling

              lie after lie 

    for ever let me rest now from thy smarts 

              alas  for pity go

              and fire their hearts

    that have been hard to thee  mine was not so 





    never again deluding love shall know me 

              for i will die 

    and all those griefs that think to overgrow me

              shall be as i 

    for ever will i sleep  while poor maids cry  

              ‘alas  for pity stay 

              and let us die

    with thee  men cannot mock us in the clay ’





 212    love’s emblems 



    now the lusty spring is seen 

      golden yellow  gaudy blue 

      daintily invite the view 

    everywhere on every green

    roses blushing as they blow 

      and enticing men to pull 

    lilies whiter than the snow 

      woodbines of sweet honey full 

        all love’s emblems  and all cry 

        ‘ladies  if not pluck’d  we die ’



    yet the lusty spring hath stay’d 

      blushing red and purest white

      daintily to love invite

    every woman  every maid 

    cherries kissing as they grow 

      and inviting men to taste 

    apples even ripe below 

      winding gently to the waist 

        all love’s emblems  and all cry 

        ‘ladies  if not pluck’d  we die ’





 213    hear  ye ladies 



    hear  ye ladies that despise

      what the mighty love has done 

    fear examples and be wise 

      fair callisto was a nun 

    leda  sailing on the stream

      to deceive the hopes of man 

    love accounting but a dream 

      doted on a silver swan 

        danaë  in a brazen tower 

        where no love was  loved a shower 



    hear  ye ladies that are coy 

      what the mighty love can do 

    fear the fierceness of the boy 

      the chaste moon he makes to woo 

    vesta  kindling holy fires 

      circled round about with spies

 215    beauty clear and fair 



    beauty clear and fair 

          where the air

    rather like a perfume dwells 

      where the violet and the rose

      their blue veins and blush disclose 

    and come to honour nothing else 



          where to live near

          and planted there

    is to live  and still live new 

      where to gain a favour is

      more than light  perpetual bliss  

    make me live by serving you 



    dear  again back recall

          to this light

    if men were wise to see’t 

      but only melancholy  

      o sweetest melancholy 

    welcome  folded arms and fixèd eyes 

    a sight that piercing mortifies 

    a look that’s fasten’d to the ground 

    a tongue chain’d up without a sound 



    fountain heads and pathless groves 

    places which pale passion loves 

    moonlight walks  when all the fowls

    are warmly housed  save bats and owls 

      a midnight bell  a parting groan  

      these are the sounds we feed upon 

    then stretch our bones in a still gloomy valley 

    nothing’s so dainty sweet as lovely melancholy 





 217    weep no more 



    weep no more  nor sigh  nor groan 

    sorrow calls no time that’s gone 

    violets pluck’d  the sweetest rain

    makes not fresh nor grow again 

    trim thy locks  look cheerfully 

    fate’s hid ends eyes cannot see 

    joys as wingèd dreams fly fast 

    why should sadness longer last 

    grief is but a wound to woe 

    gentlest fair  mourn  mourn no moe

    call for the robin redbreast and the wren 

    since o’er shady groves they hover 

    and with leaves and flowers do cover

    the friendless bodies of unburied men 

    call unto his funeral dole

    the ant  the field mouse  and the mole 

    to rear him hillocks that shall keep him warm 

    and  when gay tombs are robb’d  sustain no harm 

    but keep the wolf far thence  that’s foe to men 

    for with his nails he’ll dig them up again 



      218   dole  lamentation 





 219    the shrouding of the duchess of malfi 



    hark  now everything is still 

    the screech owl and the whistler shrill 

    call upon our dame aloud 

    and bid her quickly don her shroud 



    much you had of land and rent 

    your length in clay’s now competent 

    a long war disturb’d your mind 

    here your perfect peace is sign’d 



    of what is’t fools make such vain keeping 

    sin their conception  their birth weeping 

    their life a general mist of error 

    their death a hideous storm of terror 

    strew your hair with powders sweet 

    don clean linen  bathe your feet 

    and  the foul fiend more to check  

    a crucifix let bless your neck 

    ’tis now full tide ’tween night and day 

    end your groan and come away 





 220    vanitas vanitatum 



    all the flowers of the spring

    meet to perfume our burying 

    these have but their growing prime 

    and man does flourish but his time 

    survey our progress from our birth  

    we are set  we grow  we turn to earth 

    courts adieu  and all delights 

    all bewitching appetites 

    sweetest breath and clearest eye

    like perfumes go out and die 

    and consequently this is done

    as shadows wait upon the sun 

    vain the ambition of kings

    who seek by trophies and dead things

    to leave a living name behind 

    and weave but nets to catch the wind

    o happy tithon  if thou know’st thy hap 

      and valuest thy wealth  as i my want 

      then need’st thou not  which ah  i grieve to grant  

    repine at jove  lull’d in his leman’s lap 

    that golden shower in which he did repose  

          one dewy drop it stains

          which thy aurora rains

          upon the rural plains 

    when from thy bed she passionately goes 



    then  waken’d with the music of the merles 

      she not remembers memnon when she mourns 

      that faithful flame which in her bosom burns

    from crystal conduits throws those liquid pearls 

      sad from thy sight so soon to be removed 

          she so her grief delates 

         o favour’d by the fates

          above the happiest states 

    who art of one so worthy well beloved

    to cry for vengeance

      sin doth never cease

        phœbus  arise 

        and paint the sable skies

    with azure  white  and red 

    rouse memnon’s mother from her tithon’s bed 

    that she thy career may with roses spread 

    the nightingales thy coming each where sing 

    make an eternal spring 

    give life to this dark world which lieth dead 

    spread forth thy golden hair

    in larger locks than thou wast wont before 

    and emperor like decore

    with diadem of pearl thy temples fair 

    chase hence the ugly night

    which serves but to make dear thy glorious light 

    this is that happy morn 

    that day  long wishèd day

    of all my life so dark

     if cruel stars have not my ruin sworn

    and fates not hope betray  

    which  only white  deserves

    a diamond for ever should it mark 

    this is the morn should bring into this grove

    my love  to hear and recompense my love 

    fair king  who all preserves 

    but show thy blushing beams 

    and thou two sweeter eyes

    shalt see than those which by penèus’ streams

    did once thy heart surprise 

    nay  suns  which shine as clear

    as thou when two thou did to rome appear 

    now  flora  deck thyself in fairest guise 

    if that ye  winds  would hear

    a voice surpassing far amphion’s lyre 

    your stormy chiding stay 

    let zephyr only breathe

    and with her tresses play 

    kissing sometimes these purple ports of death 



    the winds all silent are 

    and phœbus in his chair

    ensaffroning sea and air

    makes vanish every star 

    night like a drunkard reels

    beyond the hills to shun his flaming wheels 

    the fields with flowers are deck’d in every hue 

    the clouds bespangle with bright gold their blue 

    here is the pleasant place  

    and everything  save her  who all should grace

        her hair about her eyne 

    with neck and breast’s ripe apples to be seen 

        at first glance of the morn

    in cyprus’ gardens gathering those fair flow’rs

        which of her blood were born 

    i saw  but fainting saw  my paramours 

    the graces naked danced about the place 

        the winds and trees amazed

        with silence on her gazed 

    the flowers did smile  like those upon her face 

    and as their aspen stalks those fingers band 

        that she might read my case 

    a hyacinth i wish’d me in her hand

        that zephyr every year

        so soon was heard to sigh in forests here 

    it was for her  that wrapp’d in gowns of green

        meads were so early seen 

    that in the saddest months oft sung the merles 

    it was for her  for her trees dropp’d forth pearls 

        that proud and stately courts

    did envy those our shades and calm resorts 

    it was for her  and she is gone  o woe

    thou turn’st  sweet youth  but ah  my pleasant hours

    and happy days with thee come not again 

    the sad memorials only of my pain

    do with thee turn  which turn my sweets in sours 

    thou art the same which still thou wast before

    but she  whose breath embalm’d thy wholesome air 

    is gone  nor gold nor gems her can restore 

      neglected virtue  seasons go and come

    alexis  here she stay’d  among these pines 

    sweet hermitress  she did alone repair 

    here did she spread the treasure of her hair 

    more rich than that brought from the colchian mines 

    she set her by these muskèd eglantines 

      the happy place the print seems yet to bear 

    her voice did sweeten here thy sugar’d lines 

    to which winds  trees  beasts  birds  did lend their ear 

    me here she first perceived  and here a morn

    of bright carnations did o’erspread her face 

    here did she sigh  here first my hopes were born 

    and i first got a pledge of promised grace 

      but ah  what served it to be happy so 

      sith passèd pleasures double but new woe

        the beauty and the life

        of life’s and beauty’s fairest paragon

    to which pale atropos had set her knife 

        the soul with many a groan

        had left each outward part 

    and now did take his last leave of the heart 

    naught else did want  save death  ev’n to be dead 

    when the afflicted band about her bed 

    seeing so fair him come in lips  cheeks  eyes 

    cried  ‘ ah  and can death enter paradise  ’

        my thoughts hold mortal strife

    oft call that prince which here doth monarchise 

       but he  grim grinning king 

    who caitiffs scorns  and doth the blest surprise 

    late having deck’d with beauty’s rose his tomb 

    disdains to crop a weed  and will not come

        and thou yet in that frost

        which flower and fruit hath lost 

    as if all here immortal were  dost stay 

        for shame  thy powers awake 

    look to that heaven which never night makes black 

    and there at that immortal sun’s bright rays 

    deck thee with flowers which fear not rage of days

 233    wooing song 



    love is the blossom where there blows

    every thing that lives or grows 

    love doth make the heav’ns to move 

    and the sun doth burn in love 

    love the strong and weak doth yoke 

    and makes the ivy climb the oak 

    under whose shadows lions wild 

    soften’d by love  grow tame and mild 

    love no med’cine can appease 

    he burns the fishes in the seas 

    not all the skill his wounds can stench 

    not all the sea his fire can quench 

    love did make the bloody spear

    once a leavy coat to wear 

    while in his leaves there shrouded lay

    sweet birds  for love that sing and play

    and of all love’s joyful flame

    i the bud and blossom am 

        only bend thy knee to me 

        thy wooing shall thy winning be



    see  see the flowers that below

    now as fresh as morning blow 

    and of all the virgin rose

    that as bright aurora shows 

    how they all unleavèd die 

    losing their virginity 

    like unto a summer shade 

    but now born  and now they fade 

    every thing doth pass away 

    there is danger in delay 

    come  come  gather then the rose 

    gather it  or it you lose 

    all the sand of tagus’ shore

    into my bosom casts his ore 

    all the valleys’ swimming corn

    to my house is yearly borne 

    every grape of every vine

    is gladly bruised to make me wine 

    while ten thousand kings  as proud 

    to carry up my train have bow’d 

    and a world of ladies send me

    in my chambers to attend me 

    all the stars in heav’n that shine 

    and ten thousand more  are mine 

        only bend thy knee to me 

        thy wooing shall thy winning be

    mortality  behold and fear 

    what a change of flesh is here 

    think how many royal bones

    sleep within this heap of stones 

    here they lie had realms and lands 

    who now want strength to stir their hands 

    where from their pulpits seal’d with dust

    they preach  ‘in greatness is no trust ’

    here’s an acre sown indeed

    with the richest  royall’st seed

    that the earth did e’er suck in

    since the first man died for sin 

    here the bones of birth have cried  

    ‘though gods they were  as men they died ’

    here are sands  ignoble things 

    dropt from the ruin’d sides of kings 

    here’s a world of pomp and state 

    buried in dust  once dead by fate

 236    i loved a lass 



    i loved a lass  a fair one 

      as fair as e’er was seen 

    she was indeed a rare one 

      another sheba queen 

    but  fool as then i was 

      i thought she loved me too 

    but now  alas  she’s left me 

       falero  lero  loo  



    her hair like gold did glister 

      each eye was like a star 

    she did surpass her sister 

      which pass’d all others far 

    she would me honey call 

      she’d  o she’d kiss me too 

    but now  alas  she’s left me 

       falero  lero  loo  





    many a merry meeting

      my love and i have had 

    she was my only sweeting 

      she made my heart full glad 

    the tears stood in her eyes

      like to the morning dew 

    but now  alas  she’s left me 

       falero  lero  loo  



    her cheeks were like the cherry 

      her skin was white as snow 

    when she was blithe and merry

      she angel like did show 

    her waist exceeding small 

      the fives did fit her shoe 

    but now  alas  she’s left me 

       falero  lero  loo  



    in summer time or winter

      she had her heart’s desire 

    i still did scorn to stint her

      from sugar  sack  or fire 

    the world went round about 

      no cares we ever knew 

    but now  alas  she’s left me 

       falero  lero  loo  



    to maidens’ vows and swearing

      henceforth no credit give 

    you may give them the hearing 

      but never them believe 

    they are as false as fair 

      unconstant  frail  untrue 

    for mine  alas  hath left me

 237    the lover’s resolution 



    shall i  wasting in despair 

    die because a woman’s fair 

    or make pale my cheeks with care

    ’cause another’s rosy are 

    be she fairer than the day 

    or the flow’ry meads in may 

      if she think not well of me 

      what care i how fair she be 



    shall my silly heart be pined

    ’cause i see a woman kind 

    or a well disposèd nature

    joinèd with a lovely feature 

    be she meeker  kinder  than

    turtle dove or pelican 

      if she be not so to me 

      what care i how kind she be 



    shall a woman’s virtues move

    me to perish for her love 

    or her well deservings known

    make me quite forget my own 

    be she with that goodness blest

    which may merit name of best 

      if she be not such to me 

      what care i how good she be 



    ’cause her fortune seems too high 

    shall i play the fool and die 

    she that bears a noble mind 

    if not outward helps she find 

    thinks what with them he would do

    that without them dares her woo 

      and unless that mind i see 

      what care i how great she be 



    great  or good  or kind  or fair 

    i will ne’er the more despair 

    if she love me  this believe 

    i will die ere she shall grieve 

    if she slight me when i woo 

    i can scorn and let her go 

      for if she be not for me 

      what care i for whom she be 





 238    the choice 



    me so oft my fancy drew

    here and there  that i ne’er knew

    where to place desire before

    so that range it might no more 

    but as he that passeth by

    where  in all her jollity 

    flora’s riches in a row

    do in seemly order grow 

    and a thousand flowers stand

    bending as to kiss his hand 

    out of which delightful store

    one he may take and no more 

    long he pausing doubteth whether

    of those fair ones he should gather 



    first the primrose courts his eyes 

    then the cowslip he espies 

    next the pansy seems to woo him 

    then carnations bow unto him 

    which whilst that enamour’d swain

    from the stalk intends to strain 

     as half fearing to be seen 

    prettily her leaves between

    peeps the violet  pale to see

    that her virtues slighted be 

    which so much his liking wins

    that to seize her he begins 



    yet before he stoop’d so low

    he his wanton eye did throw

    on a stem that grew more high 

    and the rose did there espy 

    who  beside her previous scent 

    to procure his eyes content

    did display her goodly breast 

    where he found at full exprest

    all the good that nature showers

    on a thousand other flowers 

    wherewith he affected takes it 

    his belovèd flower he makes it 

    and without desire of more

    walks through all he saw before 



    so i wand’ring but erewhile

    through the garden of this isle 

    saw rich beauties  i confess 

    and in number numberless 

    yea  so differing lovely too 

    that i had a world to do

    ere i could set up my rest 

    where to choose and choose the best 

    thus i fondly fear’d  till fate

     which i must confess in that

    did a greater favour to me

    than the world can malice do me 

    show’d to me that matchless flower 

    subject for this song of our 

    whose perfection having eyed 

    reason instantly espied

    that desire  which ranged abroad 

    there would find a period 

    and no marvel if it might 

    for it there hath all delight 

    and in her hath nature placed

    what each several fair one graced 



    let who list  for me  advance

    the admirèd flowers of france 

    let who will praise and behold

    the reservèd marigold 

    let the sweet breath’d violet now

    unto whom she pleaseth bow 

    and the fairest lily spread

    where she will her golden head 

    i have such a flower to wear

    that for those i do not care 



    let the young and happy swains

    playing on the britain plains

    court unblamed their shepherdesses 

    and with their gold curlèd tresses

    toy uncensured  until i

    grudge at their prosperity 

    let all times  both present  past 

    and the age that shall be last 

    vaunt the beauties they bring forth 

    i have found in one such worth 

    that content i neither care

    what the best before me were 

    nor desire to live and see

    who shall fair hereafter be 

    for i know the hand of nature

    will not make a fairer creature 





 239    a widow’s hymn 



    how near me came the hand of death 

      when at my side he struck my dear 

    and took away the precious breath

      which quicken’d my belovèd peer 

        how helpless am i thereby made 

        by day how grieved  by night how sad 

    and now my life’s delight is gone 

      alas  how am i left alone 



    the voice which i did more esteem

      than music in her sweetest key 

    those eyes which unto me did seem

      more comfortable than the day 

        those now by me  as they have been 

        shall never more be heard or seen 

    but what i once enjoy’d in them

    shall seem hereafter as a dream

      which my dear spouse reposed in me 

    to him now dead preserve me just

      in all that should performèd be 

        for though our being man and wife

        extendeth only to this life 

    yet neither life nor death should end

    the being of a faithful friend

 240    a welcome 



     welcome  welcome  do i sing  

     far more welcome than the spring  

     he that parteth from you never 

     shall enjoy a spring for ever  



    he that to the voice is near

      breaking from your iv’ry pale 

    need not walk abroad to hear

      the delightful nightingale 

                         welcome  welcome  then     



    he that looks still on your eyes 

      though the winter have begun

    to benumb our arteries 

       shall not want the summer’s sun 

                         welcome  welcome  then     



    he that still may see your cheeks 

      where all rareness still reposes 

    is a fool if e’er he seeks

      other lilies  other roses 

                         welcome  welcome  then     





    he to whom your soft lip yields 

      and perceives your breath in kissing 

    all the odours of the fields

      never  never shall be missing 

                         welcome  welcome  then     



    he that question would anew

      what fair eden was of old 

    let him rightly study you 

      and a brief of that behold 

                         welcome  welcome  then     





 241    the sirens’ song 



    steer  hither steer your wingèd pines 

        all beaten mariners 

    here lie love’s undiscover’d mines 

        a prey to passengers  

    perfumes far sweeter than the best

    which make the phœnix’ urn and nest 

        fear not your ships 

    nor any to oppose you save our lips 

        but come on shore 

    where no joy dies till love hath gotten more 



    for swelling waves our panting breasts 

        where never storms arise 

    exchange  and be awhile our guests 

        for stars gaze on our eyes 

    the compass love shall hourly sing 

    and as he goes about the ring 

        we will not miss

    to tell each point he nameth with a kiss 

       then come on shore 

    where no joy dies till love hath gotten more 





 242    the rose 



    a rose  as fair as ever saw the north 

    grew in a little garden all alone 

    a sweeter flower did nature ne’er put forth 

    nor fairer garden yet was never known 

    the maidens danced about it morn and noon 

    and learnèd bards of it their ditties made 

    the nimble fairies by the pale faced moon

    water’d the root and kiss’d her pretty shade 

    but well a day   the gardener careless grew 

    the maids and fairies both were kept away 

    and in a drought the caterpillars threw

    themselves upon the bud and every spray 

      god shield the stock  if heaven send no supplies 

      the fairest blossom of the garden dies 





 243    song 



    for her gait  if she be walking 

    be she sitting  i desire her

    for her state’s sake  and admire her

    for her wit if she be talking 

        gait and state and wit approve her 

        for which all and each i love her 



    be she sullen  i commend her

    for a modest  be she merry 

    for a kind one her prefer i 

    briefly  everything doth lend her

        so much grace  and so approve her 

        that for everything i love her 





 244    memory 



    so shuts the marigold her leaves

      at the departure of the sun 

    so from the honeysuckle sheaves

      the bee goes when the day is done 

    so sits the turtle when she is but one 

    and so all woe  as i since she is gone 



    to some few birds kind nature hath

      made all the summer as one day 

    which once enjoy’d  cold winter’s wrath

      as night they sleeping pass away 

    those happy creatures are  that know not yet

    the pain to be deprived or to forget 



    i oft have heard men say there be

      some that with confidence profess

    the helpful art of memory 

      but could they teach forgetfulness 

    i’d learn  and try what further art could do

    to make me love her and forget her too

 245    in obitum m s  xº maij  1614 



    may  be thou never graced with birds that sing 

                  nor flora’s pride 

    in thee all flowers and roses spring 

                  mine only died 





 246    on the countess dowager of pembroke 



    underneath this sable herse

    lies the subject of all verse 

    sidney’s sister  pembroke’s mother 

    death  ere thou hast slain another

    fair and learn’d and good as she 

    time shall throw a dart at thee

 247    corinna’s going a maying 



    get up  get up for shame  the blooming morn

        upon her wings presents the god unshorn 

        see how aurora throws her fair

        fresh quilted colours through the air 

        get up  sweet slug a bed  and see

        the dew bespangling herb and tree 

    each flower has wept and bow’d toward the east

    above an hour since  yet you not drest 

        nay  not so much as out of bed 

        when all the birds have matins said

        and sung their thankful hymns  ’tis sin 

        nay  profanation  to keep in 

    whereas a thousand virgins on this day

    spring sooner than the lark  to fetch in may 



    rise and put on your foliage  and be seen

    to come forth  like the spring time  fresh and green 

        and sweet as flora  take no care

        for jewels for your gown or hair 

        fear not  the leaves will strew

        gems in abundance upon you 





    besides  the childhood of the day has kept 

    against you come  some orient pearls unwept 

        come  and receive them while the light

        hangs on the dew locks of the night 

        and titan on the eastern hill

        retires himself  or else stands still

    till you come forth  wash  dress  be brief in praying 

    few beads are best when once we go a maying 



    come  my corinna  come  and coming  mark

    how each field turns a street  each street a park 

        made green and trimm’d with trees  see how

        devotion gives each house a bough

        or branch  each porch  each door  ere this 

        an ark  a tabernacle is 

    made up of white thorn neatly interwove 

    as if here were those cooler shades of love 

        can such delights be in the street

        and open fields  and we not see’t 

        come  we’ll abroad  and let’s obey

        the proclamation made for may 

    and sin no more  as we have done  by staying 

    but  my corinna  come  let’s go a maying 



    there’s not a budding boy or girl this day

    but is got up and gone to bring in may 

        a deal of youth ere this is come

        back  and with white thorn laden home 

        some have despatch’d their cakes and cream 

        before that we have left to dream 

    and some have wept and woo’d  and plighted troth 

    and chose their priest  ere we can cast off sloth 



     beads  prayers 



        many a green gown has been given 

        many a kiss  both odd and even 

        many a glance  too  has been sent

        from out the eye  love’s firmament 

    many a jest told of the keys betraying

    this night  and locks pick’d  yet we’re not a maying 



    come  let us go  while we are in our prime 

    and take the harmless folly of the time 

        we shall grow old apace  and die

        before we know our liberty 

        our life is short  and our days run

        as fast away as does the sun 

    and  as a vapour or a drop of rain 

    once lost  can ne’er be found again 

        so when or you or i are made

        a fable  song  or fleeting shade 

        all love  all liking  all delight

        lies drown’d with us in endless night 

    then  while time serves  and we are but decaying 

    come  my corinna  come  let’s go a maying 



      247   green gown  tumble on the grass 





 248    to the virgins  to make much of time 



    gather ye rosebuds while ye may 

      old time is still a flying 

    and this same flower that smiles to day

      to morrow will be dying 



    the glorious lamp of heaven  the sun 

      the higher he’s a getting 

    the sooner will his race be run 

      and nearer he’s to setting 





    that age is best which is the first 

      when youth and blood are warmer 

    but being spent  the worse  and worst

      times still succeed the former 



    then be not coy  but use your time 

      and while ye may  go marry 

    for having lost but once your prime 

      you may for ever tarry 





 249    to the western wind 



    sweet western wind  whose luck it is 

      made rival with the air 

    to give perenna’s lip a kiss 

      and fan her wanton hair 



    bring me but one  i’ll promise thee 

      instead of common showers 

    thy wings shall be embalm’d by me 

      and all beset with flowers 





 250    to electra 



    i dare not ask a kiss 

      i dare not beg a smile 

    lest having that  or this 

      i might grow proud the while 



    no  no  the utmost share

      of my desire shall be

    only to kiss that air

      that lately kissèd thee 





 251    to violets 



    welcome  maids of honour 

        you do bring

        in the spring 

    and wait upon her 



    she has virgins many 

        fresh and fair 

        yet you are

    more sweet than any 



    you’re the maiden posies 

        and so graced

        to be placed

    ’fore damask roses 



    yet  though thus respected 

        by and by

        ye do lie 

    poor girls  neglected 





 252    to daffodils 



    fair daffodils  we weep to see

      you haste away so soon 

    as yet the early rising sun

      has not attain’d his noon 

            stay  stay

        until the hasting day

            has run

        but to the evensong 

    and  having pray’d together  we

        will go with you along 





    we have short time to stay  as you 

      we have as short a spring 

    as quick a growth to meet decay 

      as you  or anything 

            we die

        as your hours do  and dry

            away

        like to the summer’s rain 

    or as the pearls of morning’s dew 

        ne’er to be found again 





 253    to blossoms 



    fair pledges of a fruitful tree 

        why do ye fall so fast 

      your date is not so past

    but you may stay yet here awhile

      to blush and gently smile 

          and go at last 



    what  were ye born to be

      an hour or half’s delight 

      and so to bid good night 

    ’twas pity nature brought you forth

      merely to show your worth

          and lose you quite 



    but you are lovely leaves  where we

      may read how soon things have

      their end  though ne’er so brave 

    and after they have shown their pride

      like you awhile  they glide

          into the grave 





 254    the primrose 



    ask me why i send you here

    this sweet infanta of the year 

    ask me why i send to you

    this primrose  thus bepearl’d with dew 

    i will whisper to your ears   

    the sweets of love are mix’d with tears 



    ask me why this flower does show

    so yellow green  and sickly too 

    ask me why the stalk is weak

    and bending  yet it doth not break  

    i will answer   these discover

    what fainting hopes are in a lover 





 255    the funeral rites of the rose 



    the rose was sick and smiling died 

    and  being to be sanctified 

    about the bed there sighing stood

    the sweet and flowery sisterhood 

    some hung the head  while some did bring 

    to wash her  water from the spring 

    some laid her forth  while others wept 

    but all a solemn fast there kept 

    the holy sisters  some among 

    the sacred dirge and trental sung 

    but ah  what sweets smelt everywhere 

    as heaven had spent all perfumes there 

    at last  when prayers for the dead

    and rites were all accomplishèd 

    they  weeping  spread a lawny loom 

    and closed her up as in a tomb 



      255   trental  services for the dead  of thirty masses 





 256    cherry ripe 



    cherry ripe  ripe  ripe  i cry 

    full and fair ones  come and buy 

    if so be you ask me where

    they do grow  i answer  there

    where my julia’s lips do smile 

    there’s the land  or cherry isle 

    whose plantations fully show

    all the year where cherries grow 





 257    a meditation for his mistress 



    you are a tulip seen to day 

    but  dearest  of so short a stay

    that where you grew scarce man can say 



    you are a lovely july flower 

    yet one rude wind or ruffling shower

    will force you hence  and in an hour 



    you are a sparkling rose i’ th’ bud 

    yet lost ere that chaste flesh and blood

    can show where you or grew or stood 



    you are a full spread  fair set vine 

    and can with tendrils love entwine 

    yet dried ere you distil your wine 



    you are like balm enclosèd well

    in amber or some crystal shell 

    yet lost ere you transfuse your smell 





    you are a dainty violet 

    yet withered ere you can be set

    within the virgin’s coronet 



    you are the queen all flowers among 

    but die you must  fair maid  ere long 

    as he  the maker of this song 





 258    delight in disorder 



    a sweet disorder in the dress

    kindles in clothes a wantonness 

    a lawn about the shoulders thrown

    into a fine distraction 

    an erring lace  which here and there

    enthrals the crimson stomacher 

    a cuff neglectful  and thereby

    ribbands to flow confusedly 

    a winning wave  deserving note 

    in the tempestuous petticoat 

    a careless shoe string  in whose tie

    i see a wild civility 

    do more bewitch me than when art

    is too precise in every part 





 259    upon julia’s clothes 



    whenas in silks my julia goes 

    then  then  methinks  how sweetly flows

    the liquefaction of her clothes 



    next  when i cast mine eyes and see

    that brave vibration each way free 

      o how that glittering taketh me 





 260    the bracelet  to julia 



    why i tie about thy wrist 

    julia  this silken twist 

    for what other reason is’t

    but to show thee how  in part 

    thou my pretty captive art 

    but thy bond slave is my heart 

    ’tis but silk that bindeth thee 

    knap the thread and thou art free 

    but ’tis otherwise with me 

      i am bound and fast bound  so

    that from thee i cannot go 

    if i could  i would not so 





 261    to daisies  not to shut so soon 



    shut not so soon  the dull eyed night

      has not as yet begun

    to make a seizure on the light 

      or to seal up the sun 



    no marigolds yet closèd are 

      no shadows great appear 

    nor doth the early shepherd’s star

      shine like a spangle here 



    stay but till my julia close

      her life begetting eye 

    and let the whole world then dispose

      itself to live or die 





 262    the night piece  to julia 



    her eyes the glow worm lend thee 

    the shooting stars attend thee 

        and the elves also 

        whose little eyes glow

    like the sparks of fire  befriend thee 



    no will o’ the wisp mislight thee 

    nor snake or slow worm bite thee 

        but on  on thy way

        not making a stay 

    since ghost there’s none to affright thee 



    let not the dark thee cumber 

    what though the moon does slumber 

        the stars of the night

        will lend thee their light

    like tapers clear without number 



    then  julia  let me woo thee 

    thus  thus to come unto me 

        and when i shall meet

        thy silv’ry feet 

    my soul i’ll pour into thee 





 263    to music  to becalm his fever 



    charm me asleep  and melt me so

      with thy delicious numbers 

    that  being ravish’d  hence i go

      away in easy slumbers 

          ease my sick head 

          and make my bed 

      thou power that canst sever

          from me this ill 

          and quickly still 

          though thou not kill

            my fever 



    thou sweetly canst convert the same

      from a consuming fire

    into a gentle licking flame 

      and make it thus expire 

          then make me weep

          my pains asleep 

      and give me such reposes

          that i  poor i 

          may think thereby

          i live and die

            ’mongst roses 



    fall on me like the silent dew 

      or like those maiden showers

    which  by the peep of day  do strew

      a baptism o’er the flowers 

          melt  melt my pains

          with thy soft strains 

      that  having ease me given 

          with full delight

          i leave this light 

          and take my flight

            for heaven 





 264    to dianeme 



    sweet  be not proud of those two eyes

    which starlike sparkle in their skies 

    nor be you proud that you can see

    all hearts your captives  yours yet free 

    be you not proud of that rich hair

    which wantons with the love sick air 

    whenas that ruby which you wear 

    sunk from the tip of your soft ear 

    will last to be a precious stone

    when all your world of beauty’s gone 





 265    to œnone 



    what conscience  say  is it in thee 

      when i a heart had one 

    to take away that heart from me 

      and to retain thy own 



    for shame or pity now incline

      to play a loving part 

    either to send me kindly thine 

      or give me back my heart 



    covet not both  but if thou dost

      resolve to part with neither 

    why  yet to show that thou art just 

      take me and mine together 





 266    to anthea  who may command him anything 



    bid me to live  and i will live

      thy protestant to be 

    or bid me love  and i will give

      a loving heart to thee 



    a heart as soft  a heart as kind 

      a heart as sound and free

    as in the whole world thou canst find 

      that heart i’ll give to thee 



    bid that heart stay  and it will stay

      to honour thy decree 

    or bid it languish quite away 

      and’t shall do so for thee 



    bid me to weep  and i will weep

      while i have eyes to see 

    and  having none  yet will i keep

      a heart to weep for thee 



    bid me despair  and i’ll despair

      under that cypress tree 

    or bid me die  and i will dare

      e’en death to die for thee 



    thou art my life  my love  my heart 

      the very eyes of me 

    and hast command of every part

      to live and die for thee 





 267    to the willow tree 



    thou art to all lost love the best 

      the only true plant found 

    wherewith young men and maids distrest 

      and left of love  are crown’d 



    when once the lover’s rose is dead 

      or laid aside forlorn 

    then willow garlands ’bout the head

      bedew’d with tears are worn 



    when with neglect  the lovers’ bane 

      poor maids rewarded be

    for their love lost  their only gain

      is but a wreath from thee 



    and underneath thy cooling shade 

      when weary of the light 

    the love spent youth and love sick maid

      come to weep out the night 





 268    the mad maid’s song 



    good morrow to the day so fair 

      good morning  sir  to you 

    good morrow to mine own torn hair

      bedabbled with the dew 



    good morning to this primrose too 

      good morrow to each maid

    that will with flowers the tomb bestrew

      wherein my love is laid 





    ah  woe is me  woe  woe is me 

      alack and well a day 

    for pity  sir  find out that bee

      which bore my love away 



    i’ll seek him in your bonnet brave 

      i’ll seek him in your eyes 

    nay  now i think they’ve made his grave

      i’ th’ bed of strawberries 



    i’ll seek him there  i know ere this

      the cold  cold earth doth shake him 

    but i will go  or send a kiss

      by you  sir  to awake him 



    pray hurt him not  though he be dead 

      he knows well who do love him 

    and who with green turfs rear his head 

      and who do rudely move him 



    he’s soft and tender  pray take heed  

      with bands of cowslips bind him 

    and bring him home  but ’tis decreed

      that i shall never find him 





 269    comfort to a youth that had lost his love 



    what needs complaints 

    when she a place

    has with the race

      of saints 



    in endless mirth

    she thinks not on

    what’s said or done

      in earth 





    she sees no tears 

    or any tone

    of thy deep groan

      she hears 



    nor does she mind

    or think on’t now

    that ever thou

      wast kind 



    but changed above 

    she likes not there 

    as she did here 

      thy love 



    forbear therefore 

    and lull asleep

    thy woes  and weep

      no more 





 270    to meadows 



    ye have been fresh and green 

      ye have been fill’d with flowers 

    and ye the walks have been

      where maids have spent their hours 



    you have beheld how they

      with wicker arks did come

    to kiss and bear away

      the richer cowslips home 



    you’ve heard them sweetly sing 

      and seen them in a round 

    each virgin like a spring 

      with honeysuckles crown’d 





    but now we see none here

      whose silv’ry feet did tread

    and with dishevell’d hair

      adorn’d this smoother mead 



    like unthrifts  having spent

      your stock and needy grown 

    you’re left here to lament

      your poor estates  alone 





 271    a child’s grace 



    here a little child i stand

    heaving up my either hand 

    cold as paddocks though they be 

    here i lift them up to thee 

    for a benison to fall

    on our meat and on us all  amen

 272    epitaph 



 upon a child that died 



    here she lies  a pretty bud 

    lately made of flesh and blood 

    who as soon fell fast asleep

    as her little eyes did peep 

    give her strewings  but not stir

    the earth that lightly covers her

    here a pretty baby lies

    sung asleep with lullabies 

    pray be silent and not stir

    come thou  who art the wine and wit

          of all i’ve writ 

    the grace  the glory  and the best

          piece of the rest 

    thou art of what i did intend

          the all and end 

    and what was made  was made to meet

          thee  thee  my sheet 

    come then and be to my chaste side

          both bed and bride 

    we two  as reliques left  will have

          one rest  one grave 

    and hugging close  we will not fear

          lust entering here 

    where all desires are dead and cold

          as is the mould 

    and all affections are forgot 

          or trouble not 

    here  here  the slaves and prisoners be

          from shackles free 

    and weeping widows long oppress’d

          do here find rest 

    the wrongèd client ends his laws

          here  and his cause 

    here those long suits of chancery lie

          quiet  or die 

    and all star chamber bills do cease

          or hold their peace 

    here needs no court for our request

          where all are best 

    all wise  all equal  and all just

          alike i’ th’ dust 

    nor need we here to fear the frown

          of court or crown 

    where fortune bears no sway o’er things 

          there all are kings 

    in this securer place we’ll keep

          as lull’d asleep 

    or for a little time we’ll lie

          as robes laid by 

    to be another day re worn 

          turn’d  but not torn 

    or like old testaments engross’d 

          lock’d up  not lost 

    and for a while lie here conceal’d 

          to be reveal’d

    in the hour of my distress 

    when temptations me oppress 

    and when i my sins confess 

          sweet spirit  comfort me 



    when i lie within my bed 

    sick in heart and sick in head 

    and with doubts discomforted 

          sweet spirit  comfort me 



    when the house doth sigh and weep 

    and the world is drown’d in sleep 

    yet mine eyes the watch do keep 

          sweet spirit  comfort me 





    when the passing bell doth toll 

    and the furies in a shoal

    come to fright a parting soul 

          sweet spirit  comfort me 



    when the tapers now burn blue 

    and the comforters are few 

    and that number more than true 

          sweet spirit  comfort me 



    when the priest his last hath pray’d 

    and i nod to what is said 

    ’cause my speech is now decay’d 

          sweet spirit  comfort me 



    when  god knows  i’m toss’d about

    either with despair or doubt 

    yet before the glass be out 

          sweet spirit  comfort me 



    when the tempter me pursu’th

    with the sins of all my youth 

    and half damns me with untruth 

          sweet spirit  comfort me 



    when the flames and hellish cries

    fright mine ears and fright mine eyes 

    and all terrors me surprise 

          sweet spirit  comfort me 



    when the judgment is reveal’d 

    and that open’d which was seal’d 

    when to thee i have appeal’d 

          sweet spirit  comfort me

 276    a divine rapture 



    e’en like two little bank dividing brooks 

      that wash the pebbles with their wanton streams 

    and having ranged and search’d a thousand nooks 

      meet both at length in silver breasted thames 

        where in a greater current they conjoin 

    so i my best belovèd’s am  so he is mine 



    e’en so we met  and after long pursuit 

      e’en so we joined  we both became entire 

    no need for either to renew a suit 

      for i was flax  and he was flames of fire 

        our firm united souls did more than twine 

    so i my best belovèd’s am  so he is mine 



    if all those glittering monarchs  that command

      the servile quarters of this earthly ball 

    should tender in exchange their shares of land 

      i would not change my fortunes for them all 

        their wealth is but a counter to my coin 

    the world’s but theirs  but my belovèd’s mine

 278    a contemplation upon flowers 



    brave flowers  that i could gallant it like you 

          and be as little vain 

    you come abroad  and make a harmless show 

          and to your beds of earth again 

    you are not proud  you know your birth 

    for your embroider’d garments are from earth 



    you do obey your months and times  but i

          would have it ever spring 

    my fate would know no winter  never die 

          nor think of such a thing 

    o that i could my bed of earth but view

    and smile  and look as cheerfully as you 



    o teach me to see death and not to fear 

          but rather to take truce 

    how often have i seen you at a bier 

          and there look fresh and spruce 

    you fragrant flowers  then teach me  that my breath

    like yours may sweeten and perfume my death 





 279    a renunciation 



    we  that did nothing study but the way

    to love each other  with which thoughts the day

    rose with delight to us and with them set 

    must learn the hateful art  how to forget 

    we  that did nothing wish that heaven could give

    beyond ourselves  nor did desire to live

    beyond that wish  all these now cancel must 

    as if not writ in faith  but words and dust 

    yet witness those clear vows which lovers make 

    witness the chaste desires that never brake

    into unruly heats  witness that breast

    which in thy bosom anchor’d his whole rest  

    ’tis no default in us  i dare acquite

    thy maiden faith  thy purpose fair and white

    as thy pure self  cross planets did envý

    us to each other  and heaven did untie

    faster than vows could bind  oh  that the stars 

    when lovers meet  should stand opposed in wars 



    since then some higher destinies command 

    let us not strive  nor labour to withstand

    what is past help  the longest date of grief

    can never yield a hope of our relief 

    fold back our arms  take home our fruitless loves 

    that must new fortunes try  like turtle doves

    dislodgèd from their haunts  we must in tears

    unwind a love knit up in many years 

    in this last kiss i here surrender thee

    back to thyself   so  thou again art free 

    thou in another  sad as that  resend

    the truest heart that lover e’er did lend 

    now turn from each  so fare our sever’d hearts

    as the divorced soul from her body parts 





 280    exequy on his wife 



    accept  thou shrine of my dead saint 

    instead of dirges this complaint 

    and for sweet flowers to crown thy herse

    receive a strew of weeping verse

    from thy grieved friend  whom thou might’st see

    quite melted into tears for thee 

      dear loss  since thy untimely fate 

    my task hath been to meditate

    on thee  on thee  thou art the book 

    the library whereon i look 

    tho’ almost blind  for thee  loved clay 

    i languish out  not live  the day    

    thou hast benighted me  thy set

    this eve of blackness did beget 

    who wast my day  tho’ overcast

    before thou hadst thy noontide past  

    and i remember must in tears

    thou scarce hadst seen so many years

    as day tells hours  by thy clear sun

    my love and fortune first did run 

    but thou wilt never more appear

    folded within my hemisphere 

    since both thy light and motion 

    like a fled star  is fall’n and gone 

    and ’twixt me and my soul’s dear wish

    the earth now interposèd is    

      i could allow thee for a time

    to darken me and my sad clime 

    were it a month  a year  or ten 

    i would thy exile live till then 

    and all that space my mirth adjourn  

    so thou wouldst promise to return 

    and putting off thy ashy shroud

    at length disperse this sorrow’s cloud 

      but woe is me  the longest date

    too narrow is to calculate

    these empty hopes  never shall i

    be so much blest as to descry

    a glimpse of thee  till that day come

    which shall the earth to cinders doom 

    and a fierce fever must calcine

    the body of this world  like thine 

    my little world  that fit of fire

    once off  our bodies shall aspire

    to our souls’ bliss  then we shall rise

    and view ourselves with clearer eyes

    in that calm region where no night

    can hide us from each other’s sight 

      meantime thou hast her  earth  much good

    may my harm do thee  since it stood

    with heaven’s will i might not call

    her longer mine  i give thee all

    my short lived right and interest

    in her whom living i loved best 

    be kind to her  and prithee look

    thou write into thy doomsday book

    each parcel of this rarity

    which in thy casket shrined doth lie 

    as thou wilt answer him that lent  

    not gave  thee my dear monument 

    so close the ground  and ’bout her shade

    black curtains draw  my bride is laid 

      sleep on  my love  in thy cold bed

    never to be disquieted 

    my last good night  thou wilt not wake

    till i thy fate shall overtake 

    till age  or grief  or sickness must

    marry my body to that dust

    it so much loves  and fill the room

    my heart keeps empty in thy tomb 

    stay for me there  i will not fail

    to meet thee in that hollow vale 

    and think not much of my delay 

    i am already on the way 

    and follow thee with all the speed

    desire can make  or sorrows breed 

    each minute is a short degree

    and every hour a step towards thee    

      ’tis true  with shame and grief i yield  

    thou  like the van  first took’st the field 

    and gotten hast the victory

    in thus adventuring to die

    before me  whose more years might crave

    a just precedence in the grave 

    but hark  my pulse  like a soft drum 

    beats my approach  tells thee i come 

    and slow howe’er my marches be

    i shall at last sit down by thee 

      the thought of this bids me go on

    and wait my dissolution

    with hope and comfort  dear  forgive

    the crime  i am content to live

    divided  with but half a heart 

    till we shall meet and never part

 281    virtue 



    sweet day  so cool  so calm  so bright 

    the bridal of the earth and sky  

    the dew shall weep thy fall to night 

          for thou must die 





    sweet rose  whose hue angry and brave

    bids the rash gazer wipe his eye 

    thy root is ever in its grave 

          and thou must die 



    sweet spring  full of sweet days and roses 

    a box where sweets compacted lie 

    my music shows ye have your closes 

          and all must die 



    only a sweet and virtuous soul 

    like season’d timber  never gives 

    but though the whole world turn to coal 

          then chiefly lives 





 282    easter 



    i got me flowers to straw thy way 

      i got me boughs off many a tree 

    but thou wast up by break of day 

      and brought’st thy sweets along with thee 



    yet though my flowers be lost  they say

      a heart can never come too late 

    teach it to sing thy praise this day 

      and then this day my life shall date 





 283    discipline 



    throw away thy rod 

    throw away thy wrath 

          o my god 

    take the gentle path 





    for my heart’s desire

    unto thine is bent 

          i aspire

    to a full consent 



    not a word or look

    i affect to own 

          but by book 

    and thy book alone 



    though i fail  i weep 

    though i halt in pace 

          yet i creep

    to the throne of grace 



    then let wrath remove 

    love will do the deed 

          for with love

    stony hearts will bleed 



    love is swift of foot 

    love’s a man of war 

          and can shoot 

    and can hit from far 



    who can ’scape his bow 

    that which wrought on thee 

          brought thee low 

    needs must work on me 



    throw away thy rod 

    though man frailties hath 

          thou art god 

    throw away thy wrath 





 284    a dialogue 



     man   sweetest saviour  if my soul

            were but worth the having 

          quickly should i then control

            any thought of waving 

          but when all my care and pains

          cannot give the name of gains

          to thy wretch so full of stains 

          what delight or hope remains 



     saviour   what  child  is the balance thine 

               thine the poise and measure 

             if i say  ‘thou shalt be mine ’

               finger not my treasure 

             what the gains in having thee

             do amount to  only he

             who for man was sold can see

             that transferr’d th’ accounts to me 



     man   but as i can see no merit

            leading to this favour 

          so the way to fit me for it

            is beyond my savour 

          as the reason  then  is thine 

          so the way is none of mine 

          i disclaim the whole design 

          sin disclaims and i resign 



     saviour   that is all  if that i could

               get without repining 

             and my clay  my creature  would

               follow my resigning 



     savour  savoir  knowing 



             that as i did freely part

             with my glory and desert 

             left all joys to feel all smart    



     man   ah  no more  thou break’st my heart 





 285    the pulley 



          when god at first made man 

    having a glass of blessings standing by  

    let us  said he  pour on him all we can 

    let the world’s riches  which dispersèd lie 

          contract into a span 



          so strength first made a way 

    then beauty flow’d  then wisdom  honour  pleasure 

    when almost all was out  god made a stay 

    perceiving that  alone of all his treasure 

          rest in the bottom lay 



          for if i should  said he 

    bestow this jewel also on my creature 

    he would adore my gifts instead of me 

    and rest in nature  not the god of nature 

          so both should losers be 



          yet let him keep the rest 

    but keep them with repining restlessness 

    let him be rich and weary  that at least 

    if goodness lead him not  yet weariness

          may toss him to my breast 





 286    love 



    love bade me welcome  yet my soul drew back 

          guilty of dust and sin 

    but quick eyed love  observing me grow slack

          from my first entrance in 

    drew nearer to me  sweetly questioning

          if i lack’d anything 



    ‘a guest ’ i answer’d  ‘worthy to be here ’

          love said  ‘you shall be he ’

    ‘i  the unkind  ungrateful  ah  my dear 

          i cannot look on thee ’

    love took my hand and smiling did reply 

          ‘who made the eyes but i ’



    ‘truth  lord  but i have marr’d them  let my shame

          go where it doth deserve ’

    ‘and know you not ’ says love  ‘who bore the blame ’

          ‘my dear  then i will serve ’

    ‘you must sit down ’ says love  ‘and taste my meat ’

          so i did sit and eat

 287    a hymn 



    fly  my soul  what hangs upon

            thy drooping wings 

            and weighs them down

    with love of gaudy mortal things 



    the sun is now i’ the east  each shade

            as he doth rise

            is shorter made 

    that earth may lessen to our eyes 





    o be not careless then and play

            until the star of peace

    hide all his beams in dark recess 

    poor pilgrims needs must lose their way 

    when all the shadows do increase 





 288    death the leveller 



    the glories of our blood and state

      are shadows  not substantial things 

    there is no armour against fate 

      death lays his icy hand on kings 

            sceptre and crown

            must tumble down 

      and in the dust be equal made

    with the poor crookèd scythe and spade 



    some men with swords may reap the field 

      and plant fresh laurels where they kill 

    but their strong nerves at last must yield 

      they tame but one another still 

            early or late

            they stoop to fate 

    and must give up their murmuring breath

    when they  pale captives  creep to death 



    the garlands wither on your brow 

      then boast no more your mighty deeds 

    upon death’s purple altar now

      see where the victor victim bleeds 

            your heads must come

            to the cold tomb 

    only the actions of the just

    smell sweet and blossom in their dust

 289    song 



    ask me no more where jove bestows 

    when june is past  the fading rose 

    for in your beauty’s orient deep

    these flowers  as in their causes  sleep 



    ask me no more whither do stray

    the golden atoms of the day 

    for in pure love heaven did prepare

    those powders to enrich your hair 



    ask me no more whither doth haste

    the nightingale when may is past 

    for in your sweet dividing throat

    she winters and keeps warm her note 



    ask me no more where those stars ’light

    that downwards fall in dead of night

    for in your eyes they sit  and there

    fixèd become as in their sphere 



    ask me no more if east or west

    the phœnix builds her spicy nest 

    for unto you at last she flies 

    and in your fragrant bosom dies 





 290    persuasions to joy  a song 



    if the quick spirits in your eye

    now languish and anon must die 

    if every sweet and every grace

    must fly from that forsaken face 

        then  celia  let us reap our joys

        ere time such goodly fruit destroys 



    or if that golden fleece must grow 

    for ever free from agèd snow 

    if those bright suns must know no shade 

    nor your fresh beauties ever fade 

        then fear not  celia  to bestow

        what  still being gather’d  still must grow 



    thus either time his sickle brings

    in vain  or else in vain his wings 





 291    to his inconstant mistress 



    when thou  poor excommunicate

      from all the joys of love  shalt see

    the full reward and glorious fate

      which my strong faith shall purchase me 

      then curse thine own inconstancy 



    a fairer hand than thine shall cure

      that heart which thy false oaths did wound 

    and to my soul a soul more pure

      than thine shall by love’s hand be bound 

      and both with equal glory crown’d 



    then shalt thou weep  entreat  complain

      to love  as i did once to thee 

    when all thy tears shall be as vain

      as mine were then  for thou shalt be

      damn’d for thy false apostasy 





 292    the unfading beauty 



    he that loves a rosy cheek 

      or a coral lip admires 

    or from star like eyes doth seek

      fuel to maintain his fires 

    as old time makes these decay 

    so his flames must waste away 



    but a smooth and steadfast mind 

      gentle thoughts and calm desires 

    hearts with equal love combined 

      kindle never dying fires 

    where these are not  i despise

    lovely cheeks or lips or eyes 





 293    ingrateful beauty threatened 



    know  celia  since thou art so proud 

      ’twas i that gave thee thy renown 

    thou hadst in the forgotten crowd

      of common beauties lived unknown 

    had not my verse extoll’d thy name 

    and with it imp’d the wings of fame 



    that killing power is none of thine 

      i gave it to thy voice and eyes 

    thy sweets  thy graces  all are mine 

      thou art my star  shin’st in my skies 

    then dart not from thy borrow’d sphere

    lightning on him that fix’d thee there 



      293   imp’d  grafted with new feathers 



    tempt me with such affrights no more 

      lest what i made i uncreate 

    let fools thy mystic form adore 

      i know thee in thy mortal state 

    wise poets  that wrapt truth in tales 

    knew her themselves through all her veils 





 294    epitaph 



 on the lady mary villiers 



    the lady mary villiers lies

    under this stone  with weeping eyes

    the parents that first gave her birth 

    and their sad friends  laid her in earth 

    if any of them  reader  were

    known unto thee  shed a tear 

    or if thyself possess a gem

    as dear to thee  as this to them 

    though a stranger to this place 

    bewail in theirs thine own hard case 

      for thou perhaps at thy return

      may’st find thy darling in an urn 





 295    another 



    this little vault  this narrow room 

    of love and beauty is the tomb 

    the dawning beam  that ’gan to clear

    our clouded sky  lies darkened here 

    for ever set to us  by death

    sent to enflame the world beneath 

      ’twas but a bud  yet did contain

    more sweetness than shall spring again 

    a budding star  that might have grown

    into a sun when it had blown 

    this hopeful beauty did create

    new life in love’s declining state 

    but now his empire ends  and we

    from fire and wounding darts are free 

      his brand  his bow  let no man fear 

      the flames  the arrows  all lie here

 296    time 



        time is the feather’d thing 

        and  whilst i praise

    the sparklings of thy looks and call them rays 

                  takes wing 

        leaving behind him as he flies

    an unperceivèd dimness in thine eyes 

        his minutes  whilst they’re told 

            do make us old 

        and every sand of his fleet glass 

        increasing age as it doth pass 

        insensibly sows wrinkles there

        where flowers and roses do appear 

        whilst we do speak  our fire

        doth into ice expire 

            flames turn to frost 

            and ere we can

        know how our crow turns swan 

        or how a silver snow

        springs there where jet did grow 

    our fading spring is in dull winter lost 

        since then the night hath hurl’d

            darkness  love’s shade 

        over its enemy the day  and made

                the world

        just such a blind and shapeless thing

    as ’twas before light did from darkness spring 

        let us employ its treasure

        and make shade pleasure 

    let’s number out the hours by blisses 

    and count the minutes by our kisses 

        let the heavens new motions feel

        and by our embraces wheel 

        and whilst we try the way

        by which love doth convey

            soul unto soul 

            and mingling so

        makes them such raptures know

        as makes them entrancèd lie

            in mutual ecstasy 

    let the harmonious spheres in music roll

 297    to roses in the bosom of castara 



    ye blushing virgins happy are

      in the chaste nunnery of her breasts  

    for he’d profane so chaste a fair 

      whoe’er should call them cupid’s nests 



    transplanted thus how bright ye grow 

      how rich a perfume do ye yield 

    in some close garden cowslips so

      are sweeter than i’ th’ open field 





    in those white cloisters live secure

      from the rude blasts of wanton breath   

    each hour more innocent and pure 

      till you shall wither into death 



    then that which living gave you room 

      your glorious sepulchre shall be 

    there wants no marble for a tomb

      whose breast hath marble been to me 





 298    nox nocti indicat scientiam 



      when i survey the bright

            celestial sphere 

    so rich with jewels hung  that night

      doth like an ethiop bride appear 



      my soul her wings doth spread

            and heavenward flies 

    th’ almighty’s mysteries to read

      in the large volumes of the skies 



      for the bright firmament

            shoots forth no flame

    so silent  but is eloquent

      in speaking the creator’s name 



      no unregarded star

            contracts its light

    into so small a character 

      removed far from our human sight 



      but if we steadfast look

            we shall discern

    in it  as in some holy book 

      how man may heavenly knowledge learn 





      it tells the conqueror

            that far stretch’d power 

    which his proud dangers traffic for 

      is but the triumph of an hour 



      that from the farthest north 

            some nation may 

    yet undiscover’d  issue forth 

      and o’er his new got conquest sway 



      some nation yet shut in

            with hills of ice

    may be let out to scourge his sin 

      till they shall equal him in vice 



      and then they likewise shall

            their ruin have 

    for as yourselves your empires fall 

      and every kingdom hath a grave 



      thus those celestial fires 

            though seeming mute 

    the fallacy of our desires

      and all the pride of life confute   



      for they have watch’d since first

            the world had birth 

    and found sin in itself accurst 

      and nothing permanent on earth

 299    a devout lover 



    i have a mistress  for perfections rare

    in every eye  but in my thoughts most fair 

    like tapers on the altar shine her eyes 

    her breath is the perfume of sacrifice 

    and wheresoever my fancy would begin 

    still her perfection lets religion in 

    we sit and talk  and kiss away the hours

    as chastely as the morning dews kiss flowers 

    i touch her  like my beads  with devout care 

    and come unto my courtship as my prayer 





 300    an ode to master anthony stafford 



 to hasten him into the country 



          come  spur away 

              i have no patience for a longer stay 

          but must go down

      and leave the chargeable noise of this great town 

          i will the country see 

          where old simplicity 

            though hid in gray 

            doth look more gay

      than foppery in plush and scarlet clad 

        farewell  you city wits  that are

          almost at civil war  

    ’tis time that i grow wise  when all the world grows mad 





            more of my days

      i will not spend to gain an idiot’s praise 

            or to make sport

      for some slight puisne of the inns of court 

          then  worthy stafford  say 

          how shall we spend the day 

            with what delights

            shorten the nights 

      when from this tumult we are got secure 

        where mirth with all her freedom goes 

          yet shall no finger lose 

    where every word is thought  and every thought is pure 



            there from the tree

      we’ll cherries pluck  and pick the strawberry 

            and every day

      go see the wholesome country girls make hay 

          whose brown hath lovelier grace

          than any painted face

            that i do know

            hyde park can show 

      where i had rather gain a kiss than meet

         though some of them in greater state

          might court my love with plate 

    the beauties of the cheap  and wives of lombard street 



            but think upon

      some other pleasures  these to me are none 

            why do i prate

      of women  that are things against my fate 

          i never mean to wed

          that torture to my bed 

            my muse is she

            my love shall be 

      let clowns get wealth and heirs  when i am gone

        and that great bugbear  grisly death 

          shall take this idle breath 

    if i a poem leave  that poem is my son 



            of this no more 

      we’ll rather taste the bright pomona’s store 

            no fruit shall ’scape

      our palates  from the damson to the grape 

          then  full  we’ll seek a shade 

          and hear what music’s made 

            how philomel

            her tale doth tell 

      and how the other birds do fill the quire 

        the thrush and blackbird lend their throats 

          warbling melodious notes 

    we will all sports enjoy which others but desire 



            ours is the sky 

      where at what fowl we please our hawk shall fly 

            nor will we spare

      to hunt the crafty fox or timorous hare 

          but let our hounds run loose

          in any ground they’ll choose 

            the buck shall fall 

            the stag  and all 

      our pleasures must from their own warrants be 

        for to my muse  if not to me 

          i’m sure all game is free 

    heaven  earth  are all but parts of her great royalty 



            and when we mean

      to taste of bacchus’ blessings now and then 

            and drink by stealth

      a cup or two to noble barkley’s health 

          i’ll take my pipe and try

          the phrygian melody 

            which he that hears 

            lets through his ears

      a madness to distemper all the brain 

        then i another pipe will take

          and doric music make 

    to civilize with graver notes our wits again

 301    aubade 



    the lark now leaves his wat’ry nest 

      and climbing shakes his dewy wings 

    he takes this window for the east 

      and to implore your light he sings  

    awake  awake  the morn will never rise

    till she can dress her beauty at your eyes 



    the merchant bows unto the seaman’s star 

      the ploughman from the sun his season takes 

    but still the lover wonders what they are

      who look for day before his mistress wakes 

    awake  awake  break thro’ your veils of lawn 

    then draw your curtains  and begin the dawn 





 302    to a mistress dying 



     lover   your beauty  ripe and calm and fresh

              as eastern summers are 

            must now  forsaking time and flesh 

              add light to some small star 





     philosopher   whilst she yet lives  were stars decay’d 

                    their light by hers relief might find 

                  but death will lead her to a shade

                    where love is cold and beauty blind 



     lover   lovers  whose priests all poets are 

              think every mistress  when she dies 

            is changed at least into a star 

              and who dares doubt the poets wise 



     philosopher   but ask not bodies doom’d to die

                    to what abode they go 

                  since knowledge is but sorrow’s spy 

                    it is not safe to know 





 303    praise and prayer 



    praise is devotion fit for mighty minds 

      the diff’ring world’s agreeing sacrifice 

    where heaven divided faiths united finds 

      but prayer in various discord upward flies 



    for prayer the ocean is where diversely

      men steer their course  each to a sev’ral coast 

    where all our interests so discordant be

      that half beg winds by which the rest are lost 



    by penitence when we ourselves forsake 

      ’tis but in wise design on piteous heaven 

    in praise we nobly give what god may take 

      and are  without a beggar’s blush  forgiven

 304    on a girdle 



    that which her slender waist confined

    shall now my joyful temples bind 

    no monarch but would give his crown

    his arms might do what this has done 



    it was my heaven’s extremest sphere 

    the pale which held that lovely deer 

    my joy  my grief  my hope  my love 

    did all within this circle move 



    a narrow compass  and yet there

    dwelt all that’s good  and all that’s fair 

    give me but what this ribband bound 

    take all the rest the sun goes round 





 305    go  lovely rose 



        go  lovely rose  

    tell her that wastes her time and me 

        that now she knows 

    when i resemble her to thee 

    how sweet and fair she seems to be 



        tell her that’s young 

    and shuns to have her graces spied 

        that hadst thou sprung

    in deserts where no men abide 

    thou must have uncommended died 



        small is the worth

    of beauty from the light retired 

        bid her come forth 

    suffer herself to be desired 

    and not blush so to be admired 





        then die  that she

    the common fate of all things rare

        may read in thee 

    how small a part of time they share

    that are so wondrous sweet and fair 





 306    old age 



    the seas are quiet when the winds give o’er 

    so calm are we when passions are no more 

    for then we know how vain it was to boast

    of fleeting things  so certain to be lost 

    clouds of affection from our younger eyes

    conceal that emptiness which age descries 



    the soul’s dark cottage  batter’d and decay’d 

    lets in new light through chinks that time hath made 

    stronger by weakness  wiser men become

    as they draw near to their eternal home 

    leaving the old  both worlds at once they view

    that stand upon the threshold of the new

 307    hymn on the morning of christ’s nativity 



    it was the winter wilde 

    while the heav’n born childe 

      all meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies 

    nature in aw to him

    had doff’t her gawdy trim 

      with her great master so to sympathize 

    it was no season then for her

    to wanton with the sun her lusty paramour 





    only with speeches fair

    she woo’s the gentle air

      to hide her guilty front with innocent snow 

    and on her naked shame 

    pollute with sinfull blame 

      the saintly vail of maiden white to throw 

    confounded  that her makers eyes

    should look so neer upon her foul deformities 



    but he her fears to cease 

    sent down the meek eyd peace 

      she crown’d with olive green  came softly sliding

    down through the turning sphear

    his ready harbinger 

      with turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing 

    and waving wide her mirtle wand 

    she strikes a universall peace through sea and land 



    no war  or battails sound

    was heard the world around 

      the idle spear and shield were high up hung 

    the hookèd chariot stood

    unstain’d with hostile blood 

      the trumpet spake not to the armèd throng 

    and kings sate still with awfull eye 

    as if they surely knew their sovran lord was by 



    but peacefull was the night

    wherin the prince of light

      his raign of peace upon the earth began 

    the windes with wonder whist 

    smoothly the waters kist 

      whispering new joyes to the milde ocean 

    who now hath quite forgot to rave 

    while birds of calm sit brooding on the charmèd wave 





    the stars with deep amaze

    stand fixt in stedfast gaze 

      bending one way their pretious influence 

    and will not take their flight 

    for all the morning light 

      or lucifer that often warn’d them thence 

    but in their glimmering orbs did glow 

    untill their lord himself bespake  and bid them go 



    and though the shady gloom

    had given day her room 

      the sun himself with held his wonted speed 

    and hid his head for shame 

    as his inferiour flame 

      the new enlightn’d world no more should need 

    he saw a greater sun appear

    then his bright throne  or burning axletree could bear 



    the shepherds on the lawn 

    or ere the point of dawn 

      sate simply chatting in a rustick row 

    full little thought they than 

    that the mighty pan

      was kindly com to live with them below 

    perhaps their loves  or els their sheep 

    was all that did their silly thoughts so busie keep 



    when such musick sweet

    their hearts and ears did greet 

      as never was by mortall finger strook 

    divinely warbled voice

    answering the stringèd noise 

      as all their souls in blisfull rapture took

    the air such pleasure loth to lose 

    with thousand echo’s still prolongs each heav’nly close 





    nature that heard such sound

    beneath the hollow round

      of cynthia’s seat  the airy region thrilling 

    now was almost won

    to think her part was don 

      and that her raign had here its last fulfilling 

    she knew such harmony alone

    could hold all heav’n and earth in happier union 



    at last surrounds their sight

    a globe of circular light 

      that with long beams the shame fac’t night array’d 

    the helmèd cherubim

    and sworded seraphim 

      are seen in glittering ranks with wings displaid 

    harping in loud and solemn quire 

    with unexpressive notes to heav’ns new born heir 



    such musick  as ’tis said 

    before was never made 

      but when of old the sons of morning sung 

    while the creator great

    his constellations set 

      and the well ballanc’t world on hinges hung 

    and cast the dark foundations deep 

    and bid the weltring waves their oozy channel keep 



    ring out ye crystall sphears 

    once bless our human ears 

       if ye have power to touch our senses so 

    and let your silver chime

    move in melodious time 

      and let the base of heav’ns deep organ blow

    and with your ninefold harmony

    make up full consort to th’angelike symphony 





    for if such holy song

    enwrap our fancy long 

      time will run back  and fetch the age of gold 

    and speckl’d vanity

    will sicken soon and die 

      and leprous sin will melt from earthly mould 

    and hell it self will pass away 

    and leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day 



    yea truth  and justice then

    will down return to men 

      th’enameld arras of the rain bow wearing 

    and mercy set between 

    thron’d in celestiall sheen 

      with radiant feet the tissued clouds down stearing 

    and heav’n as at som festivall 

    will open wide the gates of her high palace hall 



    but wisest fate sayes no 

    this must not yet be so 

      the babe lies yet in smiling infancy 

    that on the bitter cross

    must redeem our loss 

      so both himself and us to glorifie 

    yet first to those ychain’d in sleep 

    the wakefull trump of doom must thunder through the deep 



    with such a horrid clang

    as on mount sinai rang

      while the red fire  and smouldring clouds out brake 

    the agèd earth agast

    with terrour of that blast 

      shall from the surface to the center shake 

    when at the worlds last session 

    the dreadfull judge in middle air shall spread his throne 





    and then at last our bliss

    full and perfect is 

      but now begins  for from this happy day

    th’old dragon under ground

    in straiter limits bound 

      not half so far casts his usurpèd sway 

    and wrath to see his kingdom fail 

    swindges the scaly horrour of his foulded tail 



    the oracles are dumm 

    no voice or hideous humm

      runs through the archèd roof in words deceiving 

    apollo from his shrine

    can no more divine 

      with hollow shreik the steep of delphos leaving 

    no nightly trance  or breathèd spell 

    inspire’s the pale ey’d priest from the prophetic cell 



    the lonely mountains o’re 

    and the resounding shore 

      a voice of weeping heard  and loud lament 

    from haunted spring  and dale

    edg’d with poplar pale 

      the parting genius is with sighing sent 

    with flowre inwov’n tresses torn

    the nimphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn 



    in consecrated earth 

    and on the holy hearth 

      the lars  and lemures moan with midnight plaint 

    in urns  and altars round 

    a drear  and dying sound

      affrights the flamins at their service quaint 

    and the chill marble seems to sweat 

    while each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat 





    peor  and baalim 

    forsake their temples dim 

      with that twise batter’d god of palestine 

    and moonèd ashtaroth 

    heav’ns queen and mother both 

      now sits not girt with tapers holy shine 

    the libyc hammon shrinks his horn 

    in vain the tyrian maids their wounded thamuz mourn 



    and sullen moloch fled 

    hath left in shadows dred 

      his burning idol all of blackest hue 

    in vain with cymbals ring 

    they call the grisly king 

      in dismall dance about the furnace blue 

    the brutish gods of nile as fast 

    isis and orus  and the dog anubis hast 



    nor is osiris seen

    in memphian grove  or green 

      trampling the unshowr’d grasse with lowings loud 

    nor can he be at rest

    within his sacred chest 

      naught but profoundest hell can be his shroud 

    in vain with timbrel’d anthems dark

    the sable stolèd sorcerers bear his worshipt ark 



    he feels from juda’s land

    the dredded infants hand 

      the rayes of bethlehem blind his dusky eyn 

    nor all the gods beside 

    longer dare abide 

      not typhon huge ending in snaky twine 

    our babe to shew his godhead true 

    can in his swadling bands controul the damnèd crew 

    so when the sun in bed 

    curtain’d with cloudy red 

      pillows his chin upon an orient wave 

    the flocking shadows pale 

    troop to th’infernall jail 

      each fetter’d ghost slips to his severall grave 

    and the yellow skirted fayes 

    fly after the night steeds  leaving their moon lov’d maze 



    but see the virgin blest 

    hath laid her babe to rest 

      time is our tedious song should here have ending 

    heav’ns youngest teemèd star 

    hath fixt her polisht car 

      her sleeping lord with handmaid lamp attending 

    and all about the courtly stable 

    bright harnest angels sit in order serviceable 





 308    on time 



    fly envious time  till thou run out thy race 

    call on the lazy leaden stepping hours 

    whose speed is but the heavy plummets pace 

    and glut thy self with what thy womb devours 

    which is no more then what is false and vain 

    and meerly mortal dross 

    so little is our loss 

    so little is thy gain 

    for when as each thing bad thou hast entomb’d 

    and last of all  thy greedy self consum’d 

    then long eternity shall greet our bliss

    with an individual kiss 

    and joy shall overtake us as a flood 

    when every thing that is sincerely good

    and perfectly divine 

    with truth  and peace  and love shall ever shine

    about the supreme throne

    of him  t’whose happy making sight alone 

    when once our heav’nly guided soul shall clime 

    then all this earthy grosnes quit 

    attir’d with stars  we shall for ever sit 

      triumphing over death  and chance  and thee o time 





 309    at a solemn musick 



    blest pair of sirens  pledges of heav’ns joy 

    sphear born harmonious sisters  voice  and vers 

    wed your divine sounds  and mixt power employ

    dead things with inbreath’d sense able to pierce 

    and to our high rais’d phantasie present 

    that undisturbèd song of pure content 

    ay sung before the saphire colour’d throne

    to him that sits theron

    with saintly shout  and solemn jubily 

    where the bright seraphim in burning row

    their loud up lifted angel trumpets blow 

    and the cherubick host in thousand quires

    touch their immortal harps of golden wires 

    with those just spirits that wear victorious palms 

    hymns devout and holy psalms

    singing everlastingly 

    that we on earth with undiscording voice

    may rightly answer that melodious noise 

    as once we did  till disproportion’d sin

    jarr’d against natures chime  and with harsh din

    broke the fair musick that all creatures made

    to their great lord  whose love their motion sway’d

    in perfect diapason  whilst they stood

    in first obedience  and their state of good 

    o may we soon again renew that song 

    and keep in tune with heav’n  till god ere long

    to his celestial consort us unite 

    to live with him  and sing in endles morn of light

      of cerberus and blackest midnight born 

    in stygian cave forlorn

      ’mongst horrid shapes  and shreiks  and sights unholy 

    find out som uncouth cell 

      where brooding darknes spreads his jealous wings 

    and the night raven sings 

      there  under ebon shades  and low brow’d rocks 

    as ragged as thy locks 

      in dark cimmerian desert ever dwell 

    but com thou goddes fair and free 

    in heav’n ycleap’d euphrosyne 

    and by men  heart easing mirth

    so bucksom  blith  and debonair 

      haste thee nymph  and bring with thee

    jest and youthful jollity 

    quips and cranks  and wanton wiles 

    nods  and becks  and wreathèd smiles

    and laughter holding both his sides

    on the light fantastick toe 

    and in thy right hand lead with thee 

    the mountain nymph  sweet liberty 

    and if i give thee honour due 

    mirth  admit me of thy crue

    to live with her  and live with thee 

    in unreprovèd pleasures free 

    to hear the lark begin his flight 

    and singing startle the dull night 

    from his watch towre in the skies 

    till the dappled dawn doth rise 

    then to com in spight of sorrow 

    and at my window bid good morrow 

    through the sweet briar  or the vine 

    or the twisted eglantine 

    while the cock with lively din 

    scatters the rear of darknes thin 

    and to the stack  or the barn dore 

    stoutly struts his dames before 

    oft listening how the hounds and horn

    chearly rouse the slumbring morn 

    from the side of som hoar hill 

    through the high wood echoing shrill 

    som time walking not unseen

    by hedge row elms  on hillocks green 

    right against the eastern gate 

    wher the great sun begins his state 

    rob’d in flames  and amber light 

    the clouds in thousand liveries dight 

    while the plowman neer at hand 

    whistles ore the furrow’d land 

    and the milkmaid singeth blithe 

    and the mower whets his sithe 

    and every shepherd tells his tale

    under the hawthorn in the dale 

    streit mine eye hath caught new pleasures

    whilst the lantskip round it measures 

    russet lawns  and fallows gray 

    where the nibling flocks do stray 

    mountains on whose barren brest

    the labouring clouds do often rest 

    meadows trim with daisies pide 

    shallow brooks  and rivers wide 

    towers  and battlements it sees

    boosom’d high in tufted trees 

    wher perhaps som beauty lies 

    the cynosure of neighbouring eyes 

    hard by  a cottage chimney smokes 

    from betwixt two agèd okes 

    where corydon and thyrsis met 

    are at their savory dinner set

    of hearbs  and other country messes 

    which the neat handed phillis dresses 

    and then in haste her bowre she leaves 

    with thestylis to bind the sheaves 

    or if the earlier season lead

    to the tann’d haycock in the mead 

    som times with secure delight

    the up land hamlets will invite 

    when the merry bells ring round 

    and the jocond rebecks sound

    to many a youth  and many a maid 

    dancing in the chequer’d shade 

    and young and old com forth to play

    on a sunshine holyday

    with store of ladies  whose bright eies

    in saffron robe  with taper clear 

    and pomp  and feast  and revelry

      or fill the fixèd mind with all your toyes 

    dwell in som idle brain 

      and fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess 

    as thick and numberless

      as the gay motes that people the sun beams 

    or likest hovering dreams

    but hail thou goddes  sage and holy 

    hail divinest melancholy 

    whose saintly visage is too bright

    to hit the sense of human sight 

    and therfore to our weaker view 

    ore laid with black staid wisdoms hue 

    black  but such as in esteem 

    prince memnons sister might beseem 

    or that starr’d ethiope queen that strove

    to set her beauties praise above

    the sea nymphs  and their powers offended 

    yet thou art higher far descended

    all in a robe of darkest grain 

    flowing with majestick train 

    and sable stole of cipres lawn

    with eev’n step  and musing gate 

    and looks commercing with the skies

    there held in holy passion still 

    forget thy self to marble  till

    with a sad leaden downward cast 

    thou fix them on the earth as fast 

    and joyn with thee calm peace  and quiet 

    spare fast  that oft with gods doth diet 

    and hears the muses in a ring

    to behold the wandring moon 

    riding neer her highest noon 

    like one that had bin led astray

    through the heav’ns wide pathles way 

    and oft  as if her head she bow’d 

    stooping through a fleecy cloud 

    oft on a plat of rising ground

    over som wide water’d shoar 

    swinging slow with sullen roar 

    or if the ayr will not permit 

    som still removèd place will fit 

    where glowing embers through the room

    teach light to counterfeit a gloom 

    far from all resort of mirth 

    save the cricket on the hearth 

    or the belmans drousie charm 

    to bless the dores from nightly harm 

    or let my lamp at midnight hour 

    be seen in som high lonely towr 

    where i may oft out watch the bear 

    with thrice great hermes  or unsphear

    the spirit of plato to unfold

    what worlds  or what vast regions hold

    the immortal mind that hath forsook

    her mansion in this fleshly nook

      but  o sad virgin  that thy power

    might raise musæeus from his bower

    or bid the soul of orpheus sing

    such notes as warbled to the string 

    drew iron tears down pluto’s cheek 

    and made hell grant what love did seek 

    or call up him that left half told

    the story of cambuscan bold 

    of camball  and of algarsife 

    and who had canace to wife 

    that own’d the vertuous ring and glass 

    and of the wondrous hors of brass 

    on which the tartar king did ride 

    and if ought els  great bards beside 

    in sage and solemn tunes have sung 

    of turneys and of trophies hung 

    of forests  and inchantments drear

    thus night oft see me in thy pale career 

    till civil suited morn appeer 

    not trickt and frounc’t as she was wont 

    with the attick boy to hunt 

    but cherchef’t in a comly cloud 

    while rocking winds are piping loud 

    or usher’d with a shower still 

    when the gust hath blown his fill 

    ending on the russling leaves 

    with minute drops from off the eaves 

    and when the sun begins to fling

    his flaring beams  me goddes bring

    to archèd walks of twilight groves 

    and shadows brown that sylvan loves 

    of pine  or monumental oake 

    where the rude ax with heavèd stroke 

    was never heard the nymphs to daunt 

    or fright them from their hallow’d haunt 

    there in close covert by som brook 

    where no profaner eye may look 

    hide me from day’s garish eie 

    while the bee with honied thie 

    that at her flowry work doth sing 

    and the waters murmuring

    with such consort as they keep 

    entice the dewy feather’d sleep 

    and let som strange mysterious dream 

    wave at his wings in airy stream 

    of lively portrature display’d 

    softly on my eye lids laid 

    and as i wake  sweet musick breath

    above  about  or underneath 

    sent by som spirit to mortals good 

    or th’unseen genius of the wood 

      but let my due feet never fail 

    to walk the studious cloysters pale 

    and love the high embowèd roof 

    with antick pillars massy proof 

    and storied windows richly dight 

    casting a dimm religious light 

    there let the pealing organ blow 

    to the full voic’d quire below 

    in service high  and anthems cleer 

    as may with sweetnes  through mine ear 

    dissolve me into extasies 

    and bring all heav’n before mine eyes 

    and may at last my weary age

    find out the peacefull hermitage 

    the hairy gown and mossy cell 

    where i may sit and rightly spell

    of every star that heav’n doth shew 

    and every herb that sips the dew 

    till old experience do attain

    to somthing like prophetic strain 

    these pleasures melancholy give

    rise  rise  and heave thy rosie head

    from thy coral pav’n bed 

    and bridle in thy headlong wave 

    till thou our summons answered have 

                        listen and save 



 sabrina replies  



      by the rushy fringèd bank 

    where grows the willow and the osier dank 

      my sliding chariot stayes 

    thick set with agat  and the azurn sheen

    of turkis blew  and emrauld green

      that in the channell strayes 

    whilst from off the waters fleet

    thus i set my printless feet

    o’re the cowslips velvet head 

      that bends not as i tread 

    gentle swain at thy request

      i am here 





 316    iv 



 the spirit epiloguizes  



    to the ocean now i fly 

    and those happy climes that ly

    where day never shuts his eye 

    up in the broad fields of the sky 

    there i suck the liquid ayr

    all amidst the gardens fair

    of hesperus  and his daughters three

    that sing about the golden tree 

    along the crispèd shades and bowres

    revels the spruce and jocond spring 

    the graces  and the rosie boosom’d howres 

    thither all their bounties bring 

    that there eternal summer dwels 

    and west winds  with musky wing

    about the cedar’n alleys fling

    nard  and cassia’s balmy smels 

    iris there with humid bow 

    waters the odorous banks that blow

    flowers of more mingled hew

    than her purfl’d scarf can shew 

    and drenches with elysian dew

     list mortals  if your ears be true 

    beds of hyacinth  and roses

    where young adonis oft reposes 

    waxing well of his deep wound

    in slumber soft  and on the ground

    sadly sits th’ assyrian queen 

    but far above in spangled sheen

    celestial cupid her fam’d son advanc’t 

    holds his dear psyche sweet intranc’t

    after her wandring labours long 

    till free consent the gods among

    make her his eternal bride 

    and from her fair unspotted side

    two blissful twins are to be born 

    youth and joy  so jove hath sworn 

      but now my task is smoothly don 

    i can fly  or i can run

    quickly to the green earths end 

    where the bow’d welkin slow doth bend 

    and from thence can soar as soon

    to the corners of the moon 

      mortals that would follow me 

    love vertue  she alone is free 

    she can teach ye how to clime

    higher then the spheary chime 

    or if vertue feeble were 

    heav’n it self would stoop to her 





 317    lycidas 



 a lament for a friend drowned in his passage from chester on the irish

seas  1637 



    yet once more  o ye laurels  and once more

    ye myrtles brown  with ivy never sear 

    i com to pluck your berries harsh and crude 

    and with forc’d fingers rude 

    shatter your leaves before the mellowing year 

    bitter constraint  and sad occasion dear 

    compels me to disturb your season due 

    for lycidas is dead  dead ere his prime

    young lycidas  and hath not left his peer 

    who would not sing for lycidas  he knew

    himself to sing  and build the lofty rhyme 

    he must not flote upon his watry bear

    unwept  and welter to the parching wind 

    without the meed of som melodious tear 

      begin  then  sisters of the sacred well 

    that from beneath the seat of jove doth spring 

    begin  and somwhat loudly sweep the string 

    hence with denial vain  and coy excuse 

    so may som gentle muse

    with lucky words favour my destin’d urn 

    and as he passes turn 

    and bid fair peace be to my sable shrowd 

    for we were nurst upon the self same hill 

    fed the same flock  by fountain  shade  and rill 

      together both  ere the high lawns appear’d

    under the opening eye lids of the morn 

    we drove a field  and both together heard

    what time the gray fly winds her sultry horn 

    batt’ning our flocks with the fresh dews of night 

    oft till the star that rose  at ev’ning  bright

    toward heav’ns descent had slop’d his westering wheel 

    mean while the rural ditties were not mute 

    temper’d to th’oaten flute 

    rough satyrs danc’d  and fauns with clov’n heel 

    from the glad sound would not be absent long 

    and old damætas lov’d to hear our song

      but o the heavy change  now thou art gon 

    now thou art gon  and never must return 

    thee shepherd  thee the woods  and desert caves 

    with wilde thyme and the gadding vine o’regrown 

    and all their echoes mourn 

    the willows  and the hazle copses green 

    shall now no more be seen 

    fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft layes 

    as killing as the canker to the rose 

    or taint worm to the weanling herds that graze 

    or frost to flowers  that their gay wardrop wear 

    when first the white thorn blows 

    such  lycidas  thy loss to shepherds ear 

      where were ye nymphs when the remorseless deep

    clos’d o’re the head of your lov’d lycidas 

    for neither were ye playing on the steep 

    where your old bards  the famous druids ly 

    nor on the shaggy top of mona high 

    nor yet where deva spreads her wisard stream 

    ay me  i fondly dream 

    had ye bin there  for what could that have don 

    what could the muse her self that orpheus bore 

    the muse her self  for her inchanting son

    whom universal nature did lament 

    when by the rout that made the hideous roar 

    his goary visage down the stream was sent 

    down the swift hebrus to the lesbian shore 

      alas  what boots it with uncessant care

    to tend the homely slighted shepherds trade 

    and strictly meditate the thankles muse 

    were it not better don as others use 

    to sport with amaryllis in the shade 

    or with the tangles of neæra’s hair 

    fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise

     that last infirmity of noble mind 

    to scorn delights  and live laborious dayes 

    but the fair guerdon when we hope to find 

    and think to burst out into sudden blaze 

    comes the blind fury with th’abhorrèd shears 

    and slits the thin spun life  but not the praise 

    phœbus repli’d  and touch’d my trembling ears 

    fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil 

    nor in the glistering foil

    set off to th’world  nor in broad rumour lies 

    but lives and spreds aloft by those pure eyes 

    and perfet witnes of all judging jove 

    as he pronounces lastly on each deed 

    of so much fame in heav’n expect thy meed 

      o fountain arethuse  and thou honour’d floud 

    smooth sliding mincius  crown’d with vocall reeds 

    that strain i heard was of a higher mood 

    but now my oate proceeds 

    and listens to the herald of the sea

    that came in neptune’s plea 

    he ask’d the waves  and ask’d the fellon winds 

    what hard mishap hath doom’d this gentle swain 

    and question’d every gust of rugged wings

    that blows from off each beakèd promontory 

    they knew not of his story 

    and sage hippotades their answer brings 

    that not a blast was from his dungeon stray’d 

    the ayr was calm  and on the level brine 

    sleek panope with all her sisters play’d 

    it was that fatall and perfidious bark

    built in th’eclipse  and rigg’d with curses dark 

    that sunk so low that sacred head of thine 

      next camus  reverend sire  went footing slow 

    his mantle hairy  and his bonnet sedge 

    inwrought with figures dim  and on the edge

    like to that sanguine flower inscrib’d with woe 

    ah  who hath reft  quoth he  my dearest pledge 

    last came  and last did go 

    the pilot of the galilean lake 

    two massy keyes he bore of metals twain 

     the golden opes  the iron shuts amain 

    he shook his miter’d locks  and stern bespake 

    how well could i have spar’d for thee  young swain 

    anow of such as for their bellies sake 

    creep and intrude  and climb into the fold 

    of other care they little reck’ning make 

    then how to scramble at the shearers feast 

    and shove away the worthy bidden guest 

    blind mouthes  that scarce themselves know how to hold

    a sheep hook  or have learn’d ought els the least

    that to the faithfull herdmans art belongs 

    what recks it them  what need they  they are sped 

    and when they list  their lean and flashy songs

    grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw 

    the hungry sheep look up  and are not fed 

    but swoln with wind  and the rank mist they draw 

    rot inwardly  and foul contagion spread 

    besides what the grim woolf with privy paw

    daily devours apace  and nothing sed 

    but that two handed engine at the door 

    stands ready to smite once  and smite no more 

      return alpheus  the dread voice is past 

    that shrunk thy streams  return sicilian muse 

    and call the vales  and bid them hither cast

    their bels  and flourets of a thousand hues 

    ye valleys low where the milde whispers use 

    of shades and wanton winds  and gushing brooks 

    on whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks 

    throw hither all your quaint enameld eyes 

    that on the green terf suck the honied showres 

    and purple all the ground with vernal flowres 

    bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies 

    the tufted crow toe  and pale gessamine 

    the white pink  and the pansie freakt with jeat 

    the glowing violet 

    the musk rose  and the well attir’d woodbine 

    with cowslips wan that hang the pensive hed 

    and every flower that sad embroidery wears 

    bid amaranthus all his beauty shed 

    and daffadillies fill their cups with tears 

    to strew the laureat herse where lycid lies 

    for so to interpose a little ease 

    let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise 

    ay me  whilst thee the shores  and sounding seas

    wash far away  where ere thy bones are hurld 

    whether beyond the stormy hebrides 

    where thou perhaps under the whelming tide

    visit’st the bottom of the monstrous world 

    or whether thou to our moist vows deny’d 

    sleep’st by the fable of bellerus old 

    where the great vision of the guarded mount

    looks toward namancos and bayona’s hold 

    look homeward angel now  and melt with ruth 

    and  o ye dolphins  waft the haples youth 

      weep no more  woful shepherds weep no more 

    for lycidas your sorrow is not dead 

    sunk though he be beneath the watry floar 

    so sinks the day star in the ocean bed 

    and yet anon repairs his drooping head 

    and tricks his beams  and with new spangled ore 

    flames in the forehead of the morning sky 

    so lycidas sunk low  but mounted high 

    through the dear might of him that walk’d the waves

    where other groves  and other streams along 

    with nectar pure his oozy lock’s he laves 

    and hears the unexpressive nuptiall song 

    in the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love 

    there entertain him all the saints above 

    in solemn troops  and sweet societies

    that sing  and singing in their glory move 

    and wipe the tears for ever from his eyes 

    now lycidas the shepherds weep no more 

    hence forth thou art the genius of the shore 

    in thy large recompense  and shalt be good

    to all that wander in that perilous flood 

      thus sang the uncouth swain to th’okes and rills 

    while the still morn went out with sandals gray 

    he touch’d the tender stops of various quills 

    with eager thought warbling his dorick lay 

    and now the sun had stretch’d out all the hills 

    and now was dropt into the western bay 

    at last he rose  and twitch’d his mantle blew 

    to morrow to fresh woods  and pastures new 





 317     to the lady margaret ley 



    daughter to that good earl  once president

      of englands counsel  and her treasury 

      who liv’d in both  unstain’d with gold or fee 

      and left them both  more in himself content 

    till the sad breaking of that parlament

      broke him  as that dishonest victory

      at chæronèa  fatal to liberty

      kil’d with report that old man eloquent 

    though later born  then to have known the dayes

      wherin your father flourisht  yet by you

      madam  me thinks i see him living yet 

    so well your words his noble vertues praise 

      that all both judge you to relate them true 

      and to possess them  honour’d margaret 





 318    on his blindness 



    when i consider how my light is spent 

      e’re half my days  in this dark world and wide 

      and that one talent which is death to hide 

      lodg’d with me useless  though my soul more bent

    to serve therewith my maker  and present

      my true account  least he returning chide 

      doth god exact day labour  light deny’d 

      i fondly ask  but patience to prevent

    that murmur  soon replies  god doth not need

      either man’s work or his own gifts  who best

      bear his milde yoak  they serve him best  his state

    is kingly  thousands at his bidding speed

      and post o’re land and ocean without rest 

      they also serve who only stand and waite 





 319    to mr  lawrence 



    lawrence of vertuous father vertuous son 

      now that the fields are dank  and ways are mire 

      where shall we sometimes meet  and by the fire

      help wast a sullen day  what may be won

    from the hard season gaining  time will run

      on smoother  till favonius re inspire

      the frozen earth  and cloth in fresh attire

      the lillie and rose  that neither sow’d nor spun 

    what neat repast shall feast us  light and choice 

      of attick tast  with wine  whence we may rise

      to hear the lute well toucht  or artfull voice

    warble immortal notes and tuskan ayre 

      he who of those delights can judge  and spare

      to interpose them oft  is not unwise 





 320    to cyriack skinner 



    cyriack  whose grandsire on the royal bench

      of brittish themis  with no mean applause

      pronounc’t and in his volumes taught our lawes 

      which others at their barr so often wrench 

    to day deep thoughts resolve with me to drench

      in mirth  that after no repenting drawes 

      let euclid rest and archimedes pause 

      and what the swede intend  and what the french 

    to measure life  learn thou betimes  and know

      toward solid good what leads the nearest way 

      for other things mild heav’n a time ordains 

    and disapproves that care  though wise in show 

      that with superfluous burden loads the day 

      and when god sends a cheerful hour  refrains 





 321    on his deceased wife 



    methought i saw my late espousèd saint

      brought to me like alcestis from the grave 

      whom joves great son to her glad husband gave 

      rescu’d from death by force though pale and faint 

    mine as whom washt from spot of child bed taint 

      purification in the old law did save 

      and such  as yet once more i trust to have

      full sight of her in heaven without restraint 

    came vested all in white  pure as her mind 

      her face was vail’d  yet to my fancied sight 

      love  sweetness  goodness  in her person shin’d

    so clear  as in no face with more delight 

      but o as to embrace me she enclin’d

      i wak’d  she fled  and day brought back my night 





 322    light 



    hail holy light  ofspring of heav’n first born 

    or of th’ eternal coeternal beam

    may i express thee unblam’d  since god is light 

    and never but in unapproachèd light

    dwelt from eternitie  dwelt then in thee 

    bright effluence of bright essence increate 

    or hear’st thou rather pure ethereal stream 

    whose fountain who shall tell  before the sun 

    before the heavens thou wert  and at the voice

    of god  as with a mantle didst invest

    the rising world of waters dark and deep 

    won from the void and formless infinite 

    thee i re visit now with bolder wing 

    escap’t the stygian pool  though long detain’d

    in that obscure sojourn  while in my flight

    through utter and through middle darkness borne

    with other notes then to th’ orphean lyre

    i sung of chaos and eternal night 

    taught by the heav’nly muse to venture down

    the dark descent  and up to reascend 

    though hard and rare  thee i revisit safe 

    and feel thy sovran vital lamp  but thou

    revisit’st not these eyes  that rowle in vain

    to find thy piercing ray  and find no dawn 

    so thick a drop serene hath quencht thir orbs 

    or dim suffusion veild  yet not the more

    cease i to wander where the muses haunt

    cleer spring  or shadie grove  or sunnie hill 

    smit with the love of sacred song  but chief

    thee  sion  and the flowrie brooks beneath

    that wash thy hallowd feet  and warbling flow 

    nightly i visit  nor somtimes forget

    those other two equal’d with me in fate 

    so were i equal’d with them in renown 

    blind thamyris and blind mæonides 

    and tiresias and phineus prophets old 

    then feed on thoughts  that voluntarie move

    harmonious numbers  as the wakeful bird

    sings darkling  and in shadiest covert hid

    tunes her nocturnal note  thus with the year

    seasons return  but not to me returns

    day  or the sweet approach of ev’n or morn 

    or sight of vernal bloom  or summers rose 

    or flocks  or herds  or human face divine 

    but cloud in stead  and ever during dark

    surrounds me  from the chearful waies of men

    cut off  and for the book of knowledg fair

    presented with a universal blanc

    of natures works to mee expung’d and ras’d 

    and wisdome at one entrance quite shut out 

    so much the rather thou celestial light

    shine inward  and the mind through all her powers

    irradiate  there plant eyes  all mist from thence

    purge and disperse  that i may see and tell

    of things invisible to mortal sight 





 from ‘samson agonistes’ 





 323    i 



    oh how comely it is and how reviving

    to the spirits of just men long opprest 

    when god into the hands of thir deliverer

    puts invincible might

    to quell the mighty of the earth  th’ oppressour 

    the brute and boist’rous force of violent men

    hardy and industrious to support

    tyrannic power  but raging to pursue

    the righteous and all such as honour truth 

    he all thir ammunition

    and feats of war defeats

    with plain heroic magnitude of mind

    and celestial vigour arm’d 

    thir armories and magazins contemns 

    renders them useless  while

    with wingèd expedition

    swift as the lightning glance he executes

    his errand on the wicked  who surpris’d

    lose thir defence distracted and amaz’d

    all is best  though we oft doubt 

    what th’ unsearchable dispose

    of highest wisdom brings about 

    and ever best found in the close 

    oft he seems to hide his face 

    but unexpectedly returns

    and to his faithful champion hath in place

    bore witness gloriously  whence gaza mourns

    and all that band them to resist

    his uncontroulable intent 

    his servants he with new acquist

    of true experience from this great event

    with peace and consolation hath dismist 

    and calm of mind all passion spent 









sir john suckling



1609 1642





 325    a doubt of martyrdom 



    o for some honest lover’s ghost 

      some kind unbodied post

        sent from the shades below 

        i strangely long to know

    whether the noble chaplets wear

    those that their mistress’ scorn did bear

        or those that were used kindly 



    for whatsoe’er they tell us here

      to make those sufferings dear 

        ’twill there  i fear  be found

        that to the being crown’d

    t’ have loved alone will not suffice 

    unless we also have been wise

        and have our loves enjoy’d 



    what posture can we think him in

      that  here unloved  again

        departs  and ’s thither gone

        where each sits by his own 

    or how can that elysium be

    where i my mistress still must see

        circled in other’s arms 





    for there the judges all are just 

      and sophonisba must

        be his whom she held dear 

        not his who loved her here 

    the sweet philoclea  since she died 

    lies by her pirocles his side 

        not by amphialus 



    some bays  perchance  or myrtle bough

      for difference crowns the brow

        of those kind souls that were

        the noble martyrs here 

    and if that be the only odds

     as who can tell    ye kinder gods 

        give me the woman here 





 326    the constant lover 



    out upon it  i have loved

      three whole days together 

    and am like to love three more 

      if it prove fair weather 



    time shall moult away his wings

      ere he shall discover

    in the whole wide world again

      such a constant lover 



    but the spite on ’t is  no praise

      is due at all to me 

    love with me had made no stays 

      had it any been but she 



    had it any been but she 

      and that very face 

    there had been at least ere this

      a dozen dozen in her place 





 327    why so pale and wan  



    why so pale and wan  fond lover 

            prithee  why so pale 

    will  when looking well can’t move her 

            looking ill prevail 

            prithee  why so pale 



    why so dull and mute  young sinner 

            prithee  why so mute 

    will  when speaking well can’t win her 

            saying nothing do’t 

            prithee  why so mute 



    quit  quit for shame  this will not move 

            this cannot take her 

    if of herself she will not love 

            nothing can make her 

            the devil take her 





 328    when  dearest  i but think of thee 



    when  dearest  i but think of thee 

    methinks all things that lovely be

      are present  and my soul delighted 

    for beauties that from worth arise

    are like the grace of deities 

      still present with us  tho’ unsighted 



    thus while i sit and sigh the day

    with all his borrow’d lights away 

      till night’s black wings do overtake me 

    thinking on thee  thy beauties then 

    as sudden lights do sleepy men 

      so they by their bright rays awake me 





    thus absence dies  and dying proves

    no absence can subsist with loves

      that do partake of fair perfection 

    since in the darkest night they may

    by love’s quick motion find a way

      to see each other by reflection 



    the waving sea can with each flood

    bathe some high promont that hath stood

      far from the main up in the river 

    o think not then but love can do

    as much  for that’s an ocean too 

      which flows not every day  but ever

 329    a rose 



    blown in the morning  thou shalt fade ere noon 

    what boots a life which in such haste forsakes thee 

    thou’rt wondrous frolic  being to die so soon 

    and passing proud a little colour makes thee 

    if thee thy brittle beauty so deceives 

    know then the thing that swells thee is thy bane 

    for the same beauty doth  in bloody leaves 

    the sentence of thy early death contain 

    some clown’s coarse lungs will poison thy sweet flower 

    if by the careless plough thou shalt be torn 

    and many herods lie in wait each hour

    to murder thee as soon as thou art born  

      nay  force thy bud to blow  their tyrant breath

      anticipating life  to hasten death

 330    to chloe 



 who for his sake wished herself younger 



    there are two births  the one when light

      first strikes the new awaken’d sense 

    the other when two souls unite 

      and we must count our life from thence 

    when you loved me and i loved you

    then both of us were born anew 



    love then to us new souls did give

      and in those souls did plant new powers 

    since when another life we live 

      the breath we breathe is his  not ours 

    love makes those young whom age doth chill 

    and whom he finds young keeps young still 





 331    falsehood 



    still do the stars impart their light

    to those that travel in the night 

    still time runs on  nor doth the hand

    or shadow on the dial stand 

    the streams still glide and constant are 

            only thy mind

            untrue i find 

            which carelessly

            neglects to be

    like stream or shadow  hand or star 



    fool that i am  i do recall

    my words  and swear thou’rt like them all 

    thou seem’st like stars to nourish fire 

    but o how cold is thy desire 

    and like the hand upon the brass

            thou point’st at me

            in mockery 

            if i come nigh

            shade like thou’lt fly 

    and as the stream with murmur pass 





 332    on the queen’s return from the low countries 



    hallow the threshold  crown the posts anew 

        the day shall have its due 

    twist all our victories into one bright wreath 

        on which let honour breathe 

    then throw it round the temples of our queen 

    ’tis she that must preserve those glories green 



    when greater tempests than on sea before

        received her on the shore 

    when she was shot at ‘for the king’s own good’

        by legions hired to blood 

    how bravely did she do  how bravely bear 

    and show’d  though they durst rage  she durst not fear 



    courage was cast about her like a dress

        of solemn comeliness 

    a gathered mind and an untroubled face

        did give her dangers grace 

    thus  arm’d with innocence  secure they move

    whose highest ‘treason’ is but highest love 





 333    on a virtuous young gentlewoman that died suddenly 



    she who to heaven more heaven doth annex 

    whose lowest thought was above all our sex 

    accounted nothing death but t’ be reprieved 

    and died as free from sickness as she lived 

    others are dragg’d away  or must be driven 

    she only saw her time and stept to heaven 

    where seraphims view all her glories o’er 

    as one return’d that had been there before 

    for while she did this lower world adorn 

    her body seem’d rather assumed than born 

    so rarified  advanced  so pure and whole 

    that body might have been another’s soul 

    and equally a miracle it were

    that she could die  or that she could live here

 334    i’ll never love thee more 



    my dear and only love  i pray

      that little world of thee

    be govern’d by no other sway

      than purest monarchy 

    for if confusion have a part

       which virtuous souls abhor  

    and hold a synod in thine heart 

      i’ll never love thee more 



    like alexander i will reign 

      and i will reign alone 

    my thoughts did evermore disdain

      a rival on my throne 

    he either fears his fate too much 

      or his deserts are small 

    that dares not put it to the touch 

      to gain or lose it all 



    and in the empire of thine heart 

      where i should solely be 

    if others do pretend a part

      or dare to vie with me 

    or if  committees  thou erect 

      and go on such a score 

    i’ll laugh and sing at thy neglect 

      and never love thee more 



    but if thou wilt prove faithful then 

      and constant of thy word 

    i’ll make thee glorious by my pen

      and famous by my sword 

    i’ll serve thee in such noble ways

      was never heard before 

    i’ll crown and deck thee all with bays 

      and love thee more and more

 335    coronemus nos rosis antequam marcescant 



    let us drink and be merry  dance  joke  and rejoice 

    with claret and sherry  theorbo and voice 

    the changeable world to our joy is unjust 

          all treasure’s uncertain 

          then down with your dust 

    in frolics dispose your pounds  shillings  and pence 

    for we shall be nothing a hundred years hence 





    we’ll sport and be free with moll  betty  and dolly 

    have oysters and lobsters to cure melancholy 

    fish dinners will make a man spring like a flea 

          dame venus  love’s lady 

          was born of the sea 

    with her and with bacchus we’ll tickle the sense 

    for we shall be past it a hundred years hence 



    your most beautiful bride who with garlands is crown’d

    and kills with each glance as she treads on the ground 

    whose lightness and brightness doth shine in such splendour

          that none but the stars

          are thought fit to attend her 

    though now she be pleasant and sweet to the sense 

    will be damnable mouldy a hundred years hence 



    then why should we turmoil in cares and in fears 

    turn all our tranquill’ty to sighs and to tears 

    let’s eat  drink  and play till the worms do corrupt us 

          ’tis certain   post mortem 

           nulla voluptas  

    for health  wealth and beauty  wit  learning and sense 

    must all come to nothing a hundred years hence

 336    wishes to his supposed mistress 



    whoe’er she be  

    that not impossible she

    that shall command my heart and me 



    where’er she lie 

    lock’d up from mortal eye

    in shady leaves of destiny 





    till that ripe birth

    of studied fate stand forth 

    and teach her fair steps to our earth 



    till that divine

    idea take a shrine

    of crystal flesh  through which to shine 



    meet you her  my wishes 

    bespeak her to my blisses 

    and be ye call’d my absent kisses 



    i wish her beauty 

    that owes not all its duty

    to gaudy tire  or glist’ring shoe tie 



    something more than

    taffeta or tissue can 

    or rampant feather  or rich fan 



    a face  that’s best

    by its own beauty drest 

    and can alone commend the rest 



    a face  made up

    out of no other shop

    than what nature’s white hand sets ope 



    a cheek  where youth

    and blood  with pen of truth 

    write what the reader sweetly ru’th 



    a cheek  where grows

    more than a morning rose 

    which to no box his being owes 





    lips  where all day

    a lover’s kiss may play 

    yet carry nothing thence away 



    looks  that oppress

    their richest tires  but dress

    and clothe their simplest nakedness 



    eyes  that displace

    the neighbour diamond  and outface

    that sunshine by their own sweet grace 



    tresses  that wear

    jewels but to declare

    how much themselves more precious are 



    whose native ray

    can tame the wanton day

    of gems that in their bright shades play 



    each ruby there 

    or pearl that dare appear 

    be its own blush  be its own tear 



    a well tamed heart 

    for whose more noble smart

    love may be long choosing a dart 



    eyes  that bestow

    full quivers on love’s bow 

    yet pay less arrows than they owe 



    smiles  that can warm

    the blood  yet teach a charm 

    that chastity shall take no harm 





    blushes  that bin

    the burnish of no sin 

    nor flames of aught too hot within 



    joys  that confess

    virtue their mistress 

    and have no other head to dress 



    fears  fond and slight

    as the coy bride’s  when night

    first does the longing lover right 



    days  that need borrow

    no part of their good morrow

    from a fore spent night of sorrow 



    days  that in spite

    of darkness  by the light

    of a clear mind  are day all night 



    nights  sweet as they 

    made short by lovers’ play 

    yet long by th’ absence of the day 



    life  that dares send

    a challenge to his end 

    and when it comes  say  ‘welcome  friend ’



    sydneian showers

    of sweet discourse  whose powers

    can crown old winter’s head with flowers 



    soft silken hours 

    open suns  shady bowers 

    ’bove all  nothing within that lowers 





    whate’er delight

    can make day’s forehead bright 

    or give down to the wings of night 



    i wish her store

    of worth may leave her poor

    of wishes  and i wish  no more 



    now  if time knows

    that her  whose radiant brows

    weave them a garland of my vows 



    her  whose just bays

    my future hopes can raise 

    a trophy to her present praise 



    her  that dares be

    what these lines wish to see 

    i seek no further  it is she 



    ’tis she  and here 

    lo  i unclothe and clear

    my wishes’ cloudy character 



    may she enjoy it

    whose merit dare apply it 

    but modesty dares still deny it 



    such worth as this is

    shall fix my flying wishes 

    and determine them to kisses 



    let her full glory 

    my fancies  fly before ye 

    be ye my fictions  but her story 





 337    the weeper 



      hail  sister springs 

          parents of silver footed rills 

      ever bubbling things 

    thawing crystal  snowy hills 

        still spending  never spent  i mean

        thy fair eyes  sweet magdalene 



      heavens thy fair eyes be 

    heavens of ever falling stars 

      ’tis seed time still with thee 

    and stars thou sow’st whose harvest dares

        promise the earth to countershine

        whatever makes heaven’s forehead fine 



      every morn from hence

    a brisk cherub something sips

      whose soft influence

    adds sweetness to his sweetest lips 

        then to his music  and his song

        tastes of this breakfast all day long 



      when some new bright guest

    takes up among the stars a room 

      and heaven will make a feast 

    angels with their bottles come 

        and draw from these full eyes of thine

        their master’s water  their own wine 



      the dew no more will weep

    the primrose’s pale cheek to deck 

      the dew no more will sleep

    nuzzled in the lily’s neck 

        much rather would it tremble here 

        and leave them both to be thy tear 





      when sorrow would be seen

    in her brightest majesty 

      for she is a queen  

    then is she drest by none but thee 

        then and only then she wears

        her richest pearls  i mean thy tears 



      not in the evening’s eyes 

    when they red with weeping are

      for the sun that dies 

    sits sorrow with a face so fair 

        nowhere but here did ever meet

        sweetness so sad  sadness so sweet 



      does the night arise 

    still thy tears do fall and fall 

      does night lose her eyes 

    still the fountain weeps for all 

        let day and night do what they will 

        thou hast thy task  thou weepest still 



      not  so long she lived 

    will thy tomb report of thee 

      but  so long she grieved  

    thus must we date thy memory 

        others by days  by months  by years 

        measure their ages  thou by tears 



      say  ye bright brothers 

    the fugitive sons of those fair eyes

      your fruitful mothers 

    what make you here  what hopes can ’tice

        you to be born  what cause can borrow

        you from those nests of noble sorrow 





      whither away so fast

    for sure the sordid earth

      your sweetness cannot taste 

    nor does the dust deserve your birth 

        sweet  whither haste you then  o say 

        why you trip so fast away 



       we go not to seek 

     the darlings of aurora’s bed  

       the rose’s modest cheek  

     nor the violet’s humble head  

         no such thing  we go to meet 

         a worthier object  our lord’s feet  





 338    a hymn to the name and honour of the admirable saint teresa 



    love  thou art absolute  sole lord

    of life and death  to prove the word 

    we’ll now appeal to none of all

    those thy old soldiers  great and tall 

    ripe men of martyrdom  that could reach down

    with strong arms their triumphant crown 

    such as could with lusty breath

    speak loud  unto the face of death 

    their great lord’s glorious name  to none

    of those whose spacious bosoms spread a throne

    for love at large to fill  spare blood and sweat 

    we’ll see him take a private seat 

    and make his mansion in the mild

    and milky soul of a soft child 





    scarce has she learnt to lisp a name

    of martyr  yet she thinks it shame

    life should so long play with that breath

    which spent can buy so brave a death 

    she never undertook to know

    what death with love should have to do 

    nor has she e’er yet understood

    why  to show love  she should shed blood 

    yet  though she cannot tell you why 

    she can love  and she can die 

    scarce has she blood enough to make

    a guilty sword blush for her sake 

    yet has a heart dares hope to prove

    how much less strong is death than love    



    since ’tis not to be had at home 

    she’ll travel for a martyrdom 

    no home for her  confesses she 

    but where she may a martyr be 

    she’ll to the moors  and trade with them

    for this unvalued diadem 

    she offers them her dearest breath 

    with christ’s name in ’t  in change for death 

    she’ll bargain with them  and will give

    them god  and teach them how to live

    in him  or  if they this deny 

    for him she’ll teach them how to die 

    so shall she leave amongst them sown

    her lord’s blood  or at least her own 



    farewell then  all the world  adieu 

    teresa is no more for you 

    farewell all pleasures  sports  and joys 

    never till now esteemèd toys 





    farewell whatever dear may be  

    mother’s arms  or father’s knee 

    farewell house  and farewell home 

    she’s for the moors and martyrdom 



    sweet  not so fast  lo  thy fair spouse 

    whom thou seek’st with so swift vows 

    calls thee back  and bids thee come

    t’ embrace a milder martyrdom    



    o how oft shalt thou complain

    of a sweet and subtle pain 

    of intolerable joys 

    of a death  in which who dies

    loves his death  and dies again 

    and would for ever so be slain 

    and lives and dies  and knows not why

    to live  but that he still may die 

    how kindly will thy gentle heart

    kiss the sweetly killing dart 

    and close in his embraces keep

    those delicious wounds  that weep

    balsam  to heal themselves with thus 

    when these thy deaths  so numerous 

    shall all at once die into one 

    and melt thy soul’s sweet mansion 

    like a soft lump of incense  hasted

    by too hot a fire  and wasted

    into perfuming clouds  so fast

    shalt thou exhale to heaven at last

    in a resolving sigh  and then   

    o what  ask not the tongues of men 



    angels cannot tell  suffice 

    thyself shalt feel thine own full joys 

    and hold them fast for ever there 

    so soon as thou shalt first appear 

    the moon of maiden stars  thy white

    mistress  attended by such bright

    souls as thy shining self  shall come 

    and in her first ranks make thee room 

    where  ’mongst her snowy family 

    immortal welcomes wait for thee 

    o what delight  when she shall stand

    and teach thy lips heaven  with her hand 

    on which thou now may’st to thy wishes

    heap up thy consecrated kisses 

    what joy shall seize thy soul  when she 

    bending her blessèd eyes on thee 

    those second smiles of heaven  shall dart

    her mild rays through thy melting heart 



    angels  thy old friends  there shall greet thee 

    glad at their own home now to meet thee 

    all thy good works which went before 

    and waited for thee at the door 

    shall own thee there  and all in one

    weave a constellation

    of crowns  with which the king  thy spouse 

    shall build up thy triumphant brows 

    all thy old woes shall now smile on thee 

    and thy pains sit bright upon thee 

    all thy sorrows here shall shine 

    and thy sufferings be divine 

    tears shall take comfort  and turn gems 

    and wrongs repent to diadems 

    even thy deaths shall live  and new

    dress the soul which late they slew 

    thy wounds shall blush to such bright scars

    as keep account of the lamb’s wars 



    those rare works  where thou shalt leave writ

    love’s noble history  with wit

    taught thee by none but him  while here

    they feed our souls  shall clothe thine there 

    each heavenly word by whose hid flame

    our hard hearts shall strike fire  the same

    shall flourish on thy brows  and be

    both fire to us and flame to thee 

    whose light shall live bright in thy face

    by glory  in our hearts by grace 

    thou shalt look round about  and see

    thousands of crown’d souls throng to be

    themselves thy crown  sons of thy vows 

    the virgin births with which thy spouse

    made fruitful thy fair soul  go now 

    and with them all about thee bow

    to him  put on  he’ll say  put on 

    my rosy love  that thy rich zone 

    sparkling with the sacred flames

    of thousand souls  whose happy names

    heaven keeps upon thy score  thy bright

    life brought them first to kiss the light

    that kindled them to stars  and so

    thou with the lamb  thy lord  shalt go 

    and  wheresoever he sets his white

    steps  walk with him those ways of light 

    which who in death would live to see 

    must learn in life to die like thee 





 339    upon the book and picture of the seraphical saint teresa 



    o thou undaunted daughter of desires 

    by all thy dower of lights and fires 

    by all the eagle in thee  all the dove 

    by all thy lives and deaths of love 

    by thy large draughts of intellectual day 

    and by thy thirsts of love more large than they 

    by all thy brim fill’d bowls of fierce desire 

    by thy last morning’s draught of liquid fire 

    by the full kingdom of that final kiss

    that seized thy parting soul  and seal’d thee his 

    by all the heav’n thou hast in him

     fair sister of the seraphim   

    by all of him we have in thee 

    leave nothing of myself in me 

    let me so read thy life  that i

    unto all life of mine may die 





 340    verses from the shepherds’ hymn 



    we saw thee in thy balmy nest 

      young dawn of our eternal day 

    we saw thine eyes break from the east 

      and chase the trembling shades away 

    we saw thee  and we blest the sight 

    we saw thee by thine own sweet light 



    poor world  said i  what wilt thou do

      to entertain this starry stranger 

    is this the best thou canst bestow  

      a cold and not too cleanly manger 

    contend  the powers of heaven and earth 

    to fit a bed for this huge birth 



    proud world  said i  cease your contest 

      and let the mighty babe alone 

    the phœnix builds the phœnix’ nest 

      love’s architecture is his own 

    the babe  whose birth embraves this morn 

    made his own bed ere he was born 



    i saw the curl’d drops  soft and slow 

      come hovering o’er the place’s head 

    off’ring their whitest sheets of snow 

      to furnish the fair infant’s bed 

    forbear  said i  be not too bold 

    your fleece is white  but ’tis too cold 



    i saw th’ obsequious seraphim

      their rosy fleece of fire bestow 

    for well they now can spare their wings 

      since heaven itself lies here below 

    well done  said i  but are you sure

    your down  so warm  will pass for pure 



    no  no  your king’s not yet to seek

      where to repose his royal head 

    see  see how soon his new bloom’d cheek

      ’twixt mother’s breasts is gone to bed 

    sweet choice  said we  no way but so 

    not to lie cold  yet sleep in snow



    she sings thy tears asleep  and dips

      her kisses in thy weeping eye 

    she spreads the red leaves of thy lips 

      that in their buds yet blushing lie 

    she ’gainst those mother diamonds tries

    the points of her young eagle’s eyes 



    welcome  tho’ not to those gay flies 

      gilded i’ th’ beams of earthly kings 

    slippery souls in smiling eyes  

      but to poor shepherds  homespun things 

    whose wealth’s their flocks  whose wit’s to be

    well read in their simplicity 



    yet  when young april’s husband show’rs

      shall bless the fruitful maia’s bed 

    we’ll bring the first born of her flowers 

      to kiss thy feet and crown thy head 

    to thee  dread lamb  whose love must keep

    the shepherds while they feed their sheep 



    to thee  meek majesty  soft king

      of simple graces and sweet loves 

    each of us his lamb will bring 

      each his pair of silver doves 

    at last  in fire of thy fair eyes 

    ourselves become our own best sacrifice 





 341    christ crucified 



    thy restless feet now cannot go

      for us and our eternal good 

    as they were ever wont  what though

      they swim  alas  in their own flood 



    thy hands to give thou canst not lift 

      yet will thy hand still giving be 

    it gives  but o  itself’s the gift 

      it gives tho’ bound  tho’ bound ’tis free 





 342    an epitaph upon husband and wife 



 who died and were buried together  



    to these whom death again did wed

    this grave’s the second marriage bed 

    for though the hand of fate could force

    ’twixt soul and body a divorce 

    it could not sever man and wife 

    because they both lived but one life 

    peace  good reader  do not weep 

    peace  the lovers are asleep 

    they  sweet turtles  folded lie

    in the last knot that love could tie 

    let them sleep  let them sleep on 

    till the stormy night be gone 

    and the eternal morrow dawn 

    then the curtains will be drawn 

    and they wake into a light

    whose day shall never die in night

 343    to lucasta  going to the wars 



    tell me not  sweet  i am unkind 

      that from the nunnery

    of thy chaste breast and quiet mind

      to war and arms i fly 



    true  a new mistress now i chase 

      the first foe in the field 

    and with a stronger faith embrace

      a sword  a horse  a shield 





    yet this inconstancy is such

      as thou too shalt adore 

    i could not love thee  dear  so much 

      loved i not honour more 





 344    to lucasta  going beyond the seas 



        if to be absent were to be

            away from thee 

          or that when i am gone

          you or i were alone 

        then  my lucasta  might i crave

    pity from blustering wind or swallowing wave 



        but i’ll not sigh one blast or gale

            to swell my sail 

          or pay a tear to ’suage

          the foaming blue god’s rage 

        for whether he will let me pass

    or no  i’m still as happy as i was 



        though seas and land betwixt us both 

            our faith and troth 

          like separated souls 

          all time and space controls 

        above the highest sphere we meet

    unseen  unknown  and greet as angels greet 



        so then we do anticipate

            our after fate 

          and are alive i’ the skies 

          if thus our lips and eyes

        can speak like spirits unconfined

    in heaven  their earthy bodies left behind 





 345    gratiana dancing 



    she beat the happy pavèment  

    by such a star made firmament 

      which now no more the roof envìes 

        but swells up high  with atlas even 

        bearing the brighter nobler heaven 

      and  in her  all the deities 



    each step trod out a lover’s thought 

    and the ambitious hopes he brought

      chain’d to her brave feet with such arts 

        such sweet command and gentle awe 

        as  when she ceased  we sighing saw

      the floor lay paved with broken hearts 





 346    to amarantha  that she would dishevel her hair 



    amarantha sweet and fair 

    ah  braid no more that shining hair 

    as my curious hand or eye

    hovering round thee  let it fly 



    let it fly as unconfined

    as its calm ravisher the wind 

    who hath left his darling  th’ east 

    to wanton o’er that spicy nest 



    every tress must be confest 

    but neatly tangled at the best 

    like a clew of golden thread

    most excellently ravellèd 





    do not then wind up that light

    in ribbands  and o’ercloud in night 

    like the sun in’s early ray 

    but shake your head  and scatter day 





 347    the grasshopper 



    o thou that swing’st upon the waving hair

      of some well fillèd oaten beard 

    drunk every night with a delicious tear

      dropt thee from heaven  where thou wert rear’d 



    the joys of earth and air are thine entire 

      that with thy feet and wings dost hop and fly 

    and when thy poppy works  thou dost retire

      to thy carved acorn bed to lie 



    up with the day  the sun thou welcom’st then 

      sport’st in the gilt plaits of his beams 

    and all these merry days mak’st merry men 

      thyself  and melancholy streams 





 348    to althea  from prison 



    when love with unconfinèd wings

      hovers within my gates 

    and my divine althea brings

      to whisper at the grates 

    when i lie tangled in her hair

      and fetter’d to her eye 

    the birds that wanton in the air

      know no such liberty 



    when flowing cups run swiftly round

      with no allaying thames 

    our careless heads with roses bound 

      our hearts with loyal flames 

    when thirsty grief in wine we steep 

      when healths and draughts go free  

    fishes that tipple in the deep

      know no such liberty 



    when  like committed linnets  i

      with shriller throat shall sing

    the sweetness  mercy  majesty 

      and glories of my king 

    when i shall voice aloud how good

      he is  how great should be 

    enlargèd winds  that curl the flood 

      know no such liberty 



    stone walls do not a prison make 

      nor iron bars a cage 

    minds innocent and quiet take

      that for an hermitage 

    if i have freedom in my love

      and in my soul am free 

    angels alone  that soar above 

      enjoy such liberty

 349    1  drinking 



    the thirsty earth soaks up the rain 

    and drinks and gapes for drink again 

    the plants suck in the earth  and are

    with constant drinking fresh and fair 

    the sea itself  which one would think

    should have but little need of drink 

    drinks twice ten thousand rivers up 

    so fill’d that they o’erflow the cup 

    the busy sun  and one would guess

    by ’s drunken fiery face no less 

    drinks up the sea  and when he’s done 

    the moon and stars drink up the sun 

    they drink and dance by their own light 

    they drink and revel all the night 

    nothing in nature’s sober found 

    but an eternal health goes round 

    fill up the bowl  then  fill it high 

    fill all the glasses there  for why

    should every creature drink but i 

    why  man of morals  tell me why

    underneath this myrtle shade 

    on flowery beds supinely laid 

    with odorous oils my head o’erflowing 

    and around it roses growing 

    what should i do but drink away

    the heat and troubles of the day 

    in this more than kingly state

    love himself on me shall wait 

    fill to me  love  nay  fill it up 

    and mingled cast into the cup

    wit and mirth and noble fires 

    vigorous health and gay desires 

    the wheel of life no less will stay

    in a smooth than rugged way 

    since it equally doth flee 

    let the motion pleasant be 

    why do we precious ointments shower   

    nobler wines why do we pour   

    beauteous flowers why do we spread

    upon the monuments of the dead 

    nothing they but dust can show 

    or bones that hasten to be so 

    crown me with roses while i live 

    now your wines and ointments give 

    after death i nothing crave 

    let me alive my pleasures have 

    all are stoics in the grave

    foolish prater  what dost thou

    so early at my window do 

    cruel bird  thou’st ta’en away

    a dream out of my arms to day 

    a dream that ne’er must equall’d be

    by all that waking eyes may see 

    thou this damage to repair

    nothing half so sweet and fair 

    nothing half so good  canst bring 

    tho’ men say thou bring’st the spring 





 352    on the death of mr  william hervey 



    it was a dismal and a fearful night 

    scarce could the morn drive on th’ unwilling light 

    when sleep  death’s image  left my troubled breast

          by something liker death possest 

    my eyes with tears did uncommanded flow 

          and on my soul hung the dull weight

          of some intolerable fate 

    what bell was that  ah me  too much i know 



    my sweet companion and my gentle peer 

    why hast thou left me thus unkindly here 

    thy end for ever and my life to moan 

          o  thou hast left me all alone 

    thy soul and body  when death’s agony

          besieged around thy noble heart 

          did not with more reluctance part

    than i  my dearest friend  do part from thee 



    my dearest friend  would i had died for thee 

    life and this world henceforth will tedious be 

    nor shall i know hereafter what to do

          if once my griefs prove tedious too 

    silent and sad i walk about all day 

          as sullen ghosts stalk speechless by

          where their hid treasures lie 

    alas  my treasure’s gone  why do i stay 



    say  for you saw us  ye immortal lights 

    how oft unwearied have we spent the nights 

    till the ledæan stars  so famed for love 

          wonder’d at us from above 

    we spent them not in toys  in lusts  or wine 

          but search of deep philosophy 

          wit  eloquence  and poetry  

    arts which i loved  for they  my friend  were thine 



    ye fields of cambridge  our dear cambridge  say

    have ye not seen us walking every day 

    was there a tree about which did not know

          the love betwixt us two 

          henceforth  ye gentle trees  for ever fade 

    or your sad branches thicker join

          and into darksome shades combine 

    dark as the grave wherein my friend is laid 



    large was his soul  as large a soul as e’er

    submitted to inform a body here 

    high as the place ’twas shortly in heaven to have 

          but low and humble as his grave 

    so high that all the virtues there did come 

          as to their chiefest seat

          conspicuous and great 

    so low  that for me too it made a room 



    knowledge he only sought  and so soon caught

    as if for him knowledge had rather sought 

    nor did more learning ever crowded lie

          in such a short mortality 

    whene’er the skilful youth discoursed or writ 

          still did the notions throng

          about his eloquent tongue 

    nor could his ink flow faster than his wit 



    his mirth was the pure spirits of various wit 

    yet never did his god or friends forget 

    and when deep talk and wisdom came in view 

          retired  and gave to them their due 

    for the rich help of books he always took 

          though his own searching mind before

          was so with notions written o’er 

    as if wise nature had made that her book 





    with as much zeal  devotion  piety 

    he always lived  as other saints do die 

    still with his soul severe account he kept 

          weeping all debts out ere he slept 

    then down in peace and innocence he lay 

          like the sun’s laborious light 

          which still in water sets at night 

    unsullied with his journey of the day 



    but happy thou  ta’en from this frantic age 

    where ignorance and hypocrisy does rage 

    a fitter time for heaven no soul e’er chose  

          the place now only free from those 

    there ’mong the blest thou dost for ever shine 

          and wheresoe’er thou casts thy view

          upon that white and radiant crew 

    see’st not a soul clothed with more light than thine 





 353    the wish 



    well then  i now do plainly see

    this busy world and i shall ne’er agree 

    the very honey of all earthly joy

    does of all meats the soonest cloy 

        and they  methinks  deserve my pity

    who for it can endure the stings 

    the crowd and buzz and murmurings 

        of this great hive  the city 



    ah  yet  ere i descend to the grave

    may i a small house and large garden have 

    and a few friends  and many books  both true 

    both wise  and both delightful too 

        and since love ne’er will from me flee 

    a mistress moderately fair 

    and good as guardian angels are 

        only beloved and loving me 



    o fountains  when in you shall i

    myself eased of unpeaceful thoughts espy 

    o fields  o woods  when  when shall i be made

    the happy tenant of your shade 

        here’s the spring head of pleasure’s flood 

    here’s wealthy nature’s treasury 

    where all the riches lie that she

        has coin’d and stamp’d for good 



    pride and ambition here

    only in far fetch’d metaphors appear 

    here nought but winds can hurtful murmurs scatter 

    and nought but echo flatter 

        the gods  when they descended  hither

    from heaven did always choose their way 

    and therefore we may boldly say

        that ’tis the way too thither 



    how happy here should i

    and one dear she live  and embracing die 

    she who is all the world  and can exclude

    in deserts solitude 

        i should have then this only fear 

    lest men  when they my pleasures see 

    should hither throng to live like me 

        and so make a city here

    tell me not of a face that’s fair 

      nor lip and cheek that’s red 

    nor of the tresses of her hair 

      nor curls in order laid 

    nor of a rare seraphic voice

      that like an angel sings 

    though if i were to take my choice

      i would have all these things 

    but if that thou wilt have me love 

      and it must be a she 

    the only argument can move

      is that she will love me 



    the glories of your ladies be

      but metaphors of things 

    and but resemble what we see

      each common object brings 

    roses out red their lips and cheeks 

      lilies their whiteness stain 

    what fool is he that shadows seeks

      and may the substance gain 

    then if thou’lt have me love a lass

 355    an horatian ode 



 upon cromwell’s return from ireland 



    the forward youth that would appear

    must now forsake his muses dear 

        nor in the shadows sing

        his numbers languishing 



    ’tis time to leave the books in dust 

    and oil the unused armour’s rust 

        removing from the wall

        the corslet of the hall 



    so restless cromwell could not cease

    in the inglorious arts of peace 

        but through adventurous war

        urgèd his active star 



    and like the three fork’d lightning  first

    breaking the clouds where it was nurst 

        did thorough his own side

        his fiery way divide 



    for ’tis all one to courage high 

    the emulous  or enemy 

        and with such  to enclose

        is more than to oppose 



    then burning through the air he went

    and palaces and temples rent 

        and cæsar’s head at last

        did through his laurels blast 





    ’tis madness to resist or blame

    the face of angry heaven’s flame 

        and if we would speak true 

        much to the man is due 



    who  from his private gardens  where

    he lived reservèd and austere

         as if his highest plot

        to plant the bergamot  



    could by industrious valour climb

    to ruin the great work of time 

        and cast the kingdoms old

        into another mould 



    though justice against fate complain 

    and plead the ancient rights in vain  

        but those do hold or break

        as men are strong or weak  



    nature  that hateth emptiness 

    allows of penetration less 

        and therefore must make room

        where greater spirits come 



    what field of all the civil war

    where his were not the deepest scar 

        and hampton shows what part

        he had of wiser art 



    where  twining subtle fears with hope 

    he wove a net of such a scope

        that charles himself might chase

        to caresbrooke’s narrow case 

    that thence the royal actor borne

    the tragic scaffold might adorn 

        while round the armèd bands

        did clap their bloody hands 



    he nothing common did or mean

    upon that memorable scene 

        but with his keener eye

        the axe’s edge did try 



    nor call’d the gods  with vulgar spite 

    to vindicate his helpless right 

        but bow’d his comely head

        down  as upon a bed 



    this was that memorable hour

    which first assured the forcèd power 

        so when they did design

        the capitol’s first line 



    a bleeding head  where they begun 

    did fright the architects to run 

        and yet in that the state

        foresaw its happy fate 



    and now the irish are ashamed

    to see themselves in one year tamed 

        so much one man can do

        that does both act and know 



    they can affirm his praises best 

    and have  though overcome  confest

        how good he is  how just

        and fit for highest trust 





    nor yet grown stiffer with command 

    but still in the republic’s hand  

        how fit he is to sway

        that can so well obey 



    he to the commons’ feet presents

    a kingdom for his first year’s rents 

        and  what he may  forbears

        his fame  to make it theirs 



    and has his sword and spoils ungirt

    to lay them at the public’s skirt 

        so when the falcon high

        falls heavy from the sky 



    she  having kill’d  no more doth search

    but on the next green bough to perch 

        where  when he first does lure 

        the falconer has her sure 



    what may not then our isle presume

    while victory his crest does plume 

        what may not others fear 

        if thus he crowns each year 



    as cæsar he  ere long  to gaul 

    to italy an hannibal 

        and to all states not free

        shall climacteric be 



    the pict no shelter now shall find

    within his particolour’d mind 

        but  from this valour  sad

        shrink underneath the plaid 

    happy  if in the tufted brake

    the english hunter him mistake 

        nor lay his hounds in near

        the caledonian deer 



    but thou  the war’s and fortune’s son 

    march indefatigably on 

        and for the last effect 

        still keep the sword erect 



    besides the force it has to fright

    the spirits of the shady night 

        the same arts that did gain

        a power  must it maintain 





 356    a garden 



 written after the civil wars 



    see how the flowers  as at parade 

    under their colours stand display’d 

    each regiment in order grows 

    that of the tulip  pink  and rose 

    but when the vigilant patrol

    of stars walks round about the pole 

    their leaves  that to the stalks are curl’d 

    seem to their staves the ensigns furl’d 

    then in some flower’s belovèd hut

    each bee  as sentinel  is shut 

    and sleeps so too  but if once stirr’d 

    she runs you through  nor asks the word 

    o thou  that dear and happy isle 

    the garden of the world erewhile 

    thou paradise of the four seas

    which heaven planted us to please 

    but  to exclude the world  did guard

    with wat’ry if not flaming sword 

    what luckless apple did we taste

    to make us mortal and thee waste 

    unhappy  shall we never more

    that sweet militia restore 

    when gardens only had their towers 

    and all the garrisons were flowers 

    when roses only arms might bear 

    and men did rosy garlands wear 





 357    to his coy mistress 



    had we but world enough  and time 

    this coyness  lady  were no crime

    we would sit down and think which way

    to walk and pass our long love’s day 

    thou by the indian ganges’ side

    shouldst rubies find  i by the tide

    of humber would complain  i would

    love you ten years before the flood 

    and you should  if you please  refuse

    till the conversion of the jews 

    my vegetable love should grow

    vaster than empires  and more slow 

    an hundred years should go to praise

    thine eyes and on thy forehead gaze 

    two hundred to adore each breast 

    but thirty thousand to the rest 

    an age at least to every part 

    and the last age should show your heart 

    for  lady  you deserve this state 

    nor would i love at lower rate 

      but at my back i always hear

    time’s winged chariot hurrying near 

    and yonder all before us lie

    deserts of vast eternity 

    thy beauty shall no more be found 

    nor  in thy marble vault  shall sound

    my echoing song  then worms shall try

    that long preserved virginity 

    and your quaint honour turn to dust 

    and into ashes all my lust 

    the grave’s a fine and private place 

    but none  i think  do there embrace 

      now therefore  while the youthful hue

    sits on thy skin like morning dew 

    and while thy willing soul transpires

    at every pore with instant fires 

    now let us sport us while we may 

    and now  like amorous birds of prey 

    rather at once our time devour

    than languish in his slow chapt power 

    let us roll all our strength and all

    our sweetness up into one ball 

    and tear our pleasures with rough strife

    thorough the iron gates of life 

    thus  though we cannot make our sun

    stand still  yet we will make him run 



     slow chapt  slow jawed  slowly devouring 



 358    the picture of little t  c  in a prospect of flowers 



          see with what simplicity

        this nymph begins her golden days 

          in the green grass she loves to lie 

      and there with her fair aspect tames

      the wilder flowers  and gives them names 

        but only with the roses plays 

                            and them does tell

    what colour best becomes them  and what smell 



          who can foretell for what high cause

        this darling of the gods was born 

          yet this is she whose chaster laws

      the wanton love shall one day fear 

      and  under her command severe 

        see his bow broke and ensigns torn 

                            happy who can

    appease this virtuous enemy of man 



          o then let me in time compound

        and parley with those conquering eyes 

          ere they have tried their force to wound 

      ere with their glancing wheels they drive

      in triumph over hearts that strive 

        and them that yield but more despise 

                            let me be laid 

    where i may see the glories from some shade 



          meantime  whilst every verdant thing

        itself does at thy beauty charm 

          reform the errors of the spring 

      make that the tulips may have share

      of sweetness  seeing they are fair 

        and roses of their thorns disarm 

                            but most procure

    that violets may a longer age endure 



          but o  young beauty of the woods 

        whom nature courts with fruits and flowers 

          gather the flowers  but spare the buds 

      lest flora  angry at thy crime

      to kill her infants in their prime 

        do quickly make th’ example yours 

                            and ere we see 

    nip in the blossom all our hopes and thee 





 359    thoughts in a garden 



    how vainly men themselves amaze

    to win the palm  the oak  or bays 

    and their uncessant labours see

    crown’d from some single herb or tree 

    whose short and narrow vergèd shade

    does prudently their toils upbraid 

    while all the flowers and trees do close

    to weave the garlands of repose 



    fair quiet  have i found thee here 

    and innocence thy sister dear 

    mistaken long  i sought you then

    in busy companies of men 

    your sacred plants  if here below 

    only among the plants will grow 

    society is all but rude

    to this delicious solitude 



    no white nor red was ever seen

    so amorous as this lovely green 

    fond lovers  cruel as their flame 

    cut in these trees their mistress’ name 

    little  alas  they know or heed

    how far these beauties hers exceed 

    fair trees  wheres’e’er your barks i wound 

    no name shall but your own be found 



    when we have run our passions’ heat 

    love hither makes his best retreat 

    the gods  that mortal beauty chase 

    still in a tree did end their race 

    apollo hunted daphne so

    only that she might laurel grow 

    and pan did after syrinx speed

    not as a nymph  but for a reed 



    what wondrous life in this i lead 

    ripe apples drop about my head 

    the luscious clusters of the vine

    upon my mouth do crush their wine 

    the nectarine and curious peach

    into my hands themselves do reach 

    stumbling on melons  as i pass 

    ensnared with flowers  i fall on grass 



    meanwhile the mind from pleasure less

    withdraws into its happiness 

    the mind  that ocean where each kind

    does straight its own resemblance find 

    yet it creates  transcending these 

    far other worlds  and other seas 

    annihilating all that’s made

    to a green thought in a green shade 



    here at the fountain’s sliding foot 

    or at some fruit tree’s mossy root 

    casting the body’s vest aside 

    my soul into the boughs does glide 

    there  like a bird  it sits and sings 

    then whets and combs its silver wings 

    and  till prepared for longer flight 

    waves in its plumes the various light 



    such was that happy garden state

    while man there walk’d without a mate 

    after a place so pure and sweet 

    what other help could yet be meet 

    but ’twas beyond a mortal’s share

    to wander solitary there 

    two paradises ’twere in one 

    to live in paradise alone 



    how well the skilful gard’ner drew

    of flowers and herbs this dial new 

    where  from above  the milder sun

    does through a fragrant zodiac run 

    and  as it works  th’ industrious bee

    computes its time as well as we 

    how could such sweet and wholesome hours

    be reckon’d  but with herbs and flowers 





 360    bermudas 



    where the remote bermudas ride

    in the ocean’s bosom unespied 

    from a small boat that row’d along

    the listening woods received this song 



      ‘what should we do but sing his praise

    that led us through the watery maze

    unto an isle so long unknown 

    and yet far kinder than our own 

    where he the huge sea monsters wracks 

    that lift the deep upon their backs 

    he lands us on a grassy stage 

    safe from the storms’ and prelates’ rage 

    he gave us this eternal spring

    which here enamels everything 

    and sends the fowls to us in care

    on daily visits through the air 

    he hangs in shades the orange bright

    like golden lamps in a green night 

    and does in the pomegranates close

    jewels more rich than ormus shows 

    he makes the figs our mouths to meet

    and throws the melons at our feet 

    but apples plants of such a price 

    no tree could ever bear them twice 

    with cedars chosen by his hand

    from lebanon he stores the land 

    and makes the hollow seas that roar

    proclaim the ambergris on shore 

    he cast  of which we rather boast 

    the gospel’s pearl upon our coast 

    and in these rocks for us did frame

    a temple where to sound his name 

    o  let our voice his praise exalt

    till it arrive at heaven’s vault 

    which thence  perhaps  rebounding may

    echo beyond the mexique bay ’



    thus sung they in the english boat

    a holy and a cheerful note 

    and all the way  to guide their chime 

    with falling oars they kept the time 





 361    an epitaph 



    enough  and leave the rest to fame 

    ’tis to commend her  but to name 

    courtship which  living  she declined 

    when dead  to offer were unkind 

    nor can the truest wit  or friend 

    without detracting  her commend 



    to say  she lived a virgin chaste

    in this age loose and all unlaced 

    nor was  when vice is so allowed 

    of virtue or ashamed or proud 

    that her soul was on heaven so bent 

    no minute but it came and went 

    that  ready her last debt to pay 

    she summ’d her life up every day 

    modest as morn  as mid day bright 

    gentle as evening  cool as night 

      ’tis true  but all too weakly said 

    ’twas more significant  she’s dead

 362    the retreat 



    happy those early days  when i

    shin’d in my angel infancy 

    before i understood this place

    appointed for my second race 

    or taught my soul to fancy aught

    but a white celestial thought 

    when yet i had not walk’d above

    a mile or two from my first love 

    and looking back  at that short space  

    could see a glimpse of his bright face 

    when on some gilded cloud  or flow’r 

    my gazing soul would dwell an hour 

    and in those weaker glories spy

    some shadows of eternity 

    before i taught my tongue to wound

    my conscience with a sinful sound 

    or had the black art to dispense

    a several sin to ev’ry sense 

    but felt through all this fleshly dress

    bright shoots of everlastingness 



      o how i long to travel back 

    and tread again that ancient track 

    that i might once more reach that plain

    where first i left my glorious train 

    from whence th’ enlightned spirit sees

    that shady city of palm trees 

    but ah  my soul with too much stay

    is drunk  and staggers in the way 

    some men a forward motion love 

    but i by backward steps would move 

    and when this dust falls to the urn 

    in that state i came  return 





 363    peace 



    my soul  there is a country

      far beyond the stars 

    where stands a wingèd sentry

      all skilful in the wars 

    there  above noise and danger 

      sweet peace sits crown’d with smiles 

    and one born in a manger

      commands the beauteous files 

    he is thy gracious friend 

      and  o my soul  awake   

    did in pure love descend

      to die here for thy sake 

    if thou canst get but thither 

      there grows the flower of peace 

    the rose that cannot wither 

      thy fortress  and thy ease 

    leave then thy foolish ranges 

      for none can thee secure

    but one who never changes  

      thy god  thy life  thy cure 





 364    the timber 



    sure thou didst flourish once  and many springs 

      many bright mornings  much dew  many showers 

    pass’d o’er thy head  many light hearts and wings 

      which now are dead  lodg’d in thy living bowers 





    and still a new succession sings and flies 

      fresh groves grow up  and their green branches shoot

    towards the old and still enduring skies 

      while the low violet thrives at their root 



    but thou beneath the sad and heavy line

      of death  doth waste all senseless  cold  and dark 

    where not so much as dreams of light may shine 

      nor any thought of greenness  leaf  or bark 



    and yet  as if some deep hate and dissent 

      bred in thy growth betwixt high winds and thee 

    were still alive  thou dost great storms resent

      before they come  and know’st how near they be 



    else all at rest thou liest  and the fierce breath

      of tempests can no more disturb thy ease 

    but this thy strange resentment after death

      means only those who broke  in life  thy peace 





 365    friends departed 



    they are all gone into the world of light 

        and i alone sit ling’ring here 

    their very memory is fair and bright 

              and my sad thoughts doth clear 



    it glows and glitters in my cloudy breast 

        like stars upon some gloomy grove 

    or those faint beams in which this hill is drest

              after the sun’s remove 





    i see them walking in an air of glory 

        whose light doth trample on my days 

    my days  which are at best but dull and hoary 

              mere glimmering and decays 



    o holy hope  and high humility 

        high as the heavens above 

    these are your walks  and you have show’d them me 

              to kindle my cold love 



    dear  beauteous death  the jewel of the just 

        shining nowhere  but in the dark 

    what mysteries do lie beyond thy dust 

              could man outlook that mark 



    he that hath found some fledg’d bird’s nest may know 

        at first sight  if the bird be flown 

    but what fair well or grove he sings in now 

              that is to him unknown 



    and yet as angels in some brighter dreams

        call to the soul  when man doth sleep 

    so some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes 

              and into glory peep 



    if a star were confin’d into a tomb 

        her captive flames must needs burn there 

    but when the hand that lock’d her up gives room 

              she’ll shine through all the sphere 



    o father of eternal life  and all

        created glories under thee 

    resume thy spirit from this world of thrall

              into true liberty 





    either disperse these mists  which blot and fill

        my perspective still as they pass 

    or else remove me hence unto that hill 

              where i shall need no glass

      and lean your head upon my knee

      and i will show you ferlies three 



    ‘o see ye not yon narrow road 

      so thick beset wi’ thorns and briers 

    that is the path of righteousness 

     though after it but few inquires

      to bear her company 



    o he’s gart build a bonny ship 

      to sail on the salt sea 

    the mast was o’ the beaten gold 

      the sails o’ cramoisie 



    the sides were o’ the gude stout aik

      and a’ his companie 



    ‘now are ye queen of heaven hie 

      come to pardon a’ our sin 

    or are ye mary magdalane

    ‘i’m no the queen of heaven hie

    ‘o see na ye yon bonny bower 

      it’s a’ covered owre wi’ tin 

    when thou hast sail’d it round about 

      lord gregory is within ’



    and when she saw the stately tower 

      shining both clear and bright 

    whilk stood aboon the jawing wave 

      built on a rock of height 



    says  ‘row the boat  my mariners 

      and bring me to the land 

    for yonder i see my love’s castle 

      close by the salt sea strand ’



    she sail’d it round  and sail’d it round 

      and loud and loud cried she 

    ‘now break  now break your fairy charms 

      and set my true love free ’



    she’s ta’en her young son in her arms 

      and to the door she’s gane 

    and long she knock’d  and sair she ca’d 

      but answer got she nane

      o open and let me in 

    the wind blows loud and cauld  gregory 

      the rain drops fra my chin 



    ‘the shoe is frozen to my foot 

      the glove unto my hand 

    the wet drops fra my yellow hair

      o open the door to me ’



    ‘gin ye be annie of lochroyan 

      as i trow thou binna she 

    now tell me of some love tokens

      that pass’d ’tween thee and me ’



    ‘o dinna ye mind  love gregory

    ‘if ye be the lass of lochroyan

    tell me some mair o’ the love tokens

      pass’d between thee and me ’



    ‘and dinna ye mind  love gregory

    ‘ye lie  ye lie  ye ill woman 

      so loud i hear ye lie 

    for annie of the lochroyan

      is far out owre the sea ’



    fair annie turn’d her round about 

      ‘weel  sine that it be sae 

    may ne’er woman that has borne a son

      hae a heart sae fu’ o’ wae 





    ‘tak down  tak down that mast o’ gowd 

      set up a mast of tree 

    it disna become a forsaken lady

    when the cock had crawn  and the day did dawn 

      and the sun began to peep 

    up then raise lord gregory 

      and sair  sair did he weep 



    ‘o i hae dream’d a dream  mither 

      i wish it may bring good 

    that the bonny lass of lochroyan

      at my bower window stood 



    ‘o i hae dream’d a dream  mither 

      the thought o’t gars me greet 

    that fair annie of lochroyan

      lay dead at my bed feet ’



    ‘gin it be for annie of lochroyan

      that ye mak a’ this mane 

    she stood last night at your bower door 

      but i hae sent her hame ’



    ‘o wae betide ye  ill woman 

      an ill death may ye die 

    that wadna open the door yoursell

      nor yet wad waken me ’



    o he’s gane down to yon shore side 

      as fast as he could dree 

    and there he saw fair annie’s bark

      a rowing owre the sea 





    ‘o annie  annie ’ loud he cried 

      ‘o annie  o annie  bide ’

    but ay the mair he cried ‘annie ’

      the braider grew the tide 



    ‘o annie  annie  dear annie 

      dear annie  speak to me ’

    but ay the louder he gan call 

      the louder roar’d the sea 



    the wind blew loud  the waves rose hie

      and dash’d the boat on shore 

    fair annie’s corpse was in the faem 

      the babe rose never more 



    lord gregory tore his gowden locks

      and made a wafu’ moan 

    fair annie’s corpse lay at his feet 

      his bonny son was gone 



    ‘o cherry  cherry was her cheek 

      and gowden was her hair 

    and coral  coral was her lips 

      nane might with her compare ’



    then first he kiss’d her pale  pale cheek 

      and syne he kiss’d her chin 

    and syne he kiss’d her wane  wane lips 

      there was na breath within 



    ‘o wae betide my ill mither 

      an ill death may she die 

    she turn’d my true love frae my door 

      who cam so far to me 





    ‘o wae betide my ill mither 

      an ill death may she die 

    she has no been the deid o’ ane 

      but she’s been the deid of three ’



    then he’s ta’en out a little dart 

      hung low down by his gore 

    he thrust it through and through his heart 

      and words spak never more

    clerk saunders and may margaret

      walk’d owre yon garden green 

    and deep and heavy was the love

      that fell thir twa between 



    ‘a bed  a bed ’ clerk saunders said 

      ‘a bed for you and me ’

    ‘fye na  fye na ’ said may margaret

    when in and came her seven brothers 

      wi’ torches burning bright 

    they said  ‘we hae but one sister

    then out and spake the fifth o’ them 

      ‘it were great sin true love to twain ’

    and out and spake the sixth o’ them 

      ‘it were shame to slay a sleeping man ’



    then up and gat the seventh o’ them 

      and never a word spake he 

    but he has striped his bright brown brand

      out through clerk saunders’ fair bodye

    clerk saunders he started  and margaret she turn’d

      into his arms as asleep she lay 

    and sad and silent was the night

      that was atween thir twae 



    and they lay still and sleepit sound

      until the day began to daw’ 

    and kindly she to him did say 

      ‘it is time  true love  you were awa’ ’



    but he lay still  and sleepit sound 

      albeit the sun began to sheen 

    she look’d atween her and the wa’ 

      and dull and drowsie were his e’en 



    then in and came her father dear 

      said  ‘let a’ your mourning be 

    i’ll carry the dead corse to the clay 

      and i’ll come back and comfort thee ’



    ‘comfort weel your seven sons 

      for comforted i will never be 

    i ween ’twas neither knave nor loon

      was in the bower last night wi’ me ’



    the clinking bell gaed through the town 

      to carry the dead corse to the clay 

    and clerk saunders stood at may margaret’s window 

      i wot  an hour before the day 



    ‘are ye sleeping  marg’ret ’ he says 

      ‘or are ye waking presentlie 

    give me my faith and troth again 

      i wot  true love  i gied to thee ’





    ‘your faith and troth ye sail never get 

      nor our true love sail never twin 

    until ye come within my bower 

      and kiss me cheik and chin ’



    ‘my mouth it is full cold  marg’ret 

      it has the smell  now  of the ground 

    and if i kiss thy comely mouth 

      thy days of life will not be lang 



    ‘o cocks are crowing a merry midnight 

      i wot the wild fowls are boding day 

    give me my faith and troth again 

      and let me fare me on my way ’



    ‘thy faith and troth thou sallna get 

      and our true love sail never twin 

    until ye tell what comes o’ women 

      i wot  who die in strong traivelling ’



    ‘their beds are made in the heavens high 

      down at the foot of our good lord’s knee

      i wot the wild fowls are boding day 

    the psalms of heaven will soon be sung 

      and i  ere now  will be miss’d away ’



    then she has taken a crystal wand 

      and she has stroken her troth thereon 

    she has given it him out at the shot window 

      wi’ mony a sad sigh and heavy groan 



     twin  part in two 



    ‘i thank ye  marg’ret  i thank ye  marg’ret

    it’s hosen and shoon  and gown alone 

      she climb’d the wall  and follow’d him 

    until she came to the green forest 

      and there she lost the sight o’ him 



    ‘is there ony room at your head  saunders 

      is there ony room at your feet 

    or ony room at your side  saunders

      and lay it on my breast 

    and shed a tear upon my grave

    then up and crew the red  red cock 

      and up and crew the gray 

    ‘’tis time  ’tis time  my dear marg’ret

      as she walk’d by the sea 

    but a noble knight was her ransom soon 

      wi’ gowd and white monie 



    she bided in strangers’ land wi’ him 

      and none knew whence she cam 

    she lived in the castle wi’ her love 

      but never told her name 



    ‘it’s narrow  narrow  mak your bed

    fair annie served the lang tables

      wi’ the white bread and the wine 

    but ay she drank the wan water

      to keep her colour fine 



    and she gaed by the first table 

      and smiled upon them a’ 

    but ere she reach’d the second table 

      the tears began to fa’ 



     yett  gate 



    she took a napkin lang and white 

      and hung it on a pin 

    it was to wipe away the tears 

      as she gaed out and in 



    when bells were rung and mass was sung 

      and a’ men bound for bed

 374    edom o’ gordon 



    it fell about the martinmas 

      when the wind blew shrill and cauld 

    said edom o’ gordon to his men 

      ‘we maun draw to a hauld 



    ‘and what a hauld sall we draw to 

      my merry men and me 

    we will gae to the house o’ the rodes 

      to see that fair ladye ’



    the lady stood on her castle wa’ 

      beheld baith dale and down 

    there she was ware of a host of men

      cam riding towards the town 



    ‘o see ye not  my merry men a’ 

      o see ye not what i see 

    methinks i see a host of men 

      i marvel wha they be ’



    she ween’d it had been her lovely lord 

      as he cam riding hame 

    it was the traitor  edom o’ gordon 

      wha reck’d nae sin nor shame 



     town  stead 



    she had nae sooner buskit hersell 

      and putten on her gown 

    but edom o’ gordon an’ his men

      were round about the town 



    they had nae sooner supper set 

      nae sooner said the grace 

    but edom o’ gordon an’ his men

      were lighted about the place 



    the lady ran up to her tower head 

      sae fast as she could hie 

    to see if by her fair speeches

      she could wi’ him agree 



    ‘come doun to me  ye lady gay 

      come doun  come doun to me 

    this night sall ye lig within mine arms 

      to morrow my bride sall be ’



    ‘i winna come down  ye fals gordon 

      i winna come down to thee 

    i winna forsake my ain dear lord 

      that is sae far frae me ’



    ‘gie owre your house  ye lady fair 

      gie owre your house to me 

    or i sall brenn yoursel therein 

      but and your babies three ’



    ‘i winna gie owre  ye fals gordon

     buskit  attired 



    ‘now reach my pistol  glaud  my man 

      and charge ye weel my gun 

    for  but an i pierce that bluidy butcher 

      my babes  we been undone ’



    she stood upon her castle wa’ 

      and let twa bullets flee 

    she miss’d that bluidy butcher’s heart 

      and only razed his knee 



    ‘set fire to the house ’ quo’ fals gordon 

      all wud wi’ dule and ire 

    ‘fals lady  ye sail rue this deid

      ye paid me weel my fee 

    but now i’m edom o’ gordon’s man  

      maun either do or die ’



    o then bespake her little son 

      sat on the nurse’s knee 

    says  ‘mither dear  gie owre this house 

      for the reek it smithers me ’



     wud  mad  grund wa’  ground wall 



    ‘i wad gie a’ my gowd  my bairn 

      sae wad i a’ my fee

    o then bespake her dochter dear  

      she was baith jimp and sma’ 

    ‘o row me in a pair o’ sheets 

      and tow me owre the wa’ ’



    they row’d her in a pair o’ sheets 

      and tow’d her owre the wa’ 

    but on the point o’ gordon’s spear

      she gat a deadly fa’ 



    o bonnie  bonnie was her mouth 

      and cherry were her cheiks 

    and clear  clear was her yellow hair 

      whereon the red blood dreips 



    then wi’ his spear he turn’d her owre 

      o gin her face was wane 

    he said  ‘ye are the first that e’er

      i wish’d alive again ’



    he turn’d her owre and owre again 

      o gin her skin was white 

    ‘i might hae spared that bonnie face

      to hae been some man’s delight 



    ‘busk and boun  my merry men a’ 

      for ill dooms i do guess 

    i canna look in that bonnie face

      as it lies on the grass ’



     jimp  slender  trim  row  roll  wrap  busk and boun  trim up and

     prepare to go 



    ‘wha looks to freits  my master dear 

      it’s freits will follow them 

    let it ne’er be said that edom o’ gordon

      was daunted by a dame ’



    but when the lady saw the fire

      come flaming owre her head 

    she wept  and kiss’d her children twain 

      says  ‘bairns  we been but dead ’



    the gordon then his bugle blew 

      and said  ‘awa’  awa’ 

    this house o’ the rodes is a’ in a flame 

      i hauld it time to ga’ ’



    and this way lookit her ain dear lord 

      as he cam owre the lea 

    he saw his castle a’ in a lowe 

      as far as he could see 



    then sair  o sair  his mind misgave 

      and all his heart was wae 

    ‘put on  put on  my wighty men

    ‘put on  put on  my wighty men 

      sae fast as ye can drie 

    for he that’s hindmost o’ the thrang

      sall ne’er get good o’ me ’



    then some they rade  and some they ran 

      out owre the grass and bent 

    but ere the foremost could win up 

      baith lady and babes were brent 



     freits  ill omens  lowe  flame  wighty  stout  doughty

 375    the queen’s marie 



    marie hamilton’s to the kirk gane 

      wi’ ribbons in her hair 

    the king thought mair o’ marie hamilton

      than ony that were there 



    marie hamilton’s to the kirk gane

      wi’ ribbons on her breast 

    the king thought mair o’ marie hamilton

      than he listen’d to the priest 



    marie hamilton’s to the kirk gane 

      wi’ gloves upon her hands 

    the king thought mair o’ marie hamilton

      than the queen and a’ her lands 



    she hadna been about the king’s court

      a month  but barely one 

    till she was beloved by a’ the king’s court

      and the king the only man 



    she hadna been about the king’s court

      a month  but barely three 

    till frae the king’s court marie hamilton 

      marie hamilton durstna be 





    the king is to the abbey gane 

      to pu’ the abbey tree 

    to scale the babe frae marie’s heart 

      but the thing it wadna be 



    o she has row’d it in her apron 

      and set it on the sea  

    ‘gae sink ye or swim ye  bonny babe 

      ye’se get nae mair o’ me ’



    word is to the kitchen gane 

      and word is to the ha’ 

    and word is to the noble room

      amang the ladies a’ 

    that marie hamilton’s brought to bed 

      and the bonny babe’s miss’d and awa’ 



    scarcely had she lain down again 

      and scarcely fa’en asleep 

    when up and started our gude queen

      just at her bed feet 

    saying  ‘marie hamilton  where’s your babe 

      for i am sure i heard it greet ’



    ‘o no  o no  my noble queen 

      think no sic thing to be 

    ’twas but a stitch into my side 

      and sair it troubles me ’



    ‘get up  get up  marie hamilton 

      get up and follow me 

    for i am going to edinburgh town 

      a rich wedding for to see ’



     row’d  rolled  wrapped  greet  cry 



    o slowly  slowly rase she up 

      and slowly put she on 

    and slowly rade she out the way

      wi’ mony a weary groan 



    the queen was clad in scarlet 

      her merry maids all in green 

    and every town that they cam to 

      they took marie for the queen 



    ‘ride hooly  hooly  gentlemen 

      ride hooly now wi’ me 

    for never  i am sure  a wearier burd

      rade in your companie ’  



    but little wist marie hamilton 

      when she rade on the brown 

    that she was gaen to edinburgh town 

      and a’ to be put down 



    ‘why weep ye so  ye burgess wives 

      why look ye so on me 

    o i am going to edinburgh town 

      a rich wedding to see ’



    when she gaed up the tolbooth stairs 

      the corks frae her heels did flee 

    and lang or e’er she cam down again 

      she was condemn’d to die 



    when she cam to the netherbow port 

      she laugh’d loud laughters three 

    but when she came to the gallows foot

      the tears blinded her e’e 



     hooly  gently 



    ‘yestreen the queen had four maries 

      the night she’ll hae but three 

    there was marie seaton  and marie beaton 

      and marie carmichael  and me

      and put gowd upon her hair 

    but now i’ve gotten for my reward

      the gallows to be my share 



    ‘often have i dress’d my queen

      and often made her bed 

    but now i’ve gotten for my reward

      the gallows tree to tread 



    ‘i charge ye all  ye mariners 

      when ye sail owre the faem 

    let neither my father nor mother get wit

      but that i’m coming hame 



    ‘i charge ye all  ye mariners

    that neither my father nor mother get wit

      the dog’s death i’m to die 



    ‘for if my father and mother got wit 

      and my bold brethren three 

    o mickle wad be the gude red blude

      this day wad be spilt for me 



    ‘o little did my mother ken 

      the day she cradled me 

    the lands i was to travel in

 376    binnorie 



    there were twa sisters sat in a bour 

       binnorie  o binnorie  

    there cam a knight to be their wooer 

       by the bonnie milldams o’ binnorie  



    he courted the eldest with glove and ring 

    but he lo’ed the youngest abune a thing 



    the eldest she was vexèd sair 

    and sair envied her sister fair 



    upon a morning fair and clear 

    she cried upon her sister dear 



    ‘o sister  sister  tak my hand 

    and let’s go down to the river strand ’



    she’s ta’en her by the lily hand 

    and led her down to the river strand 



    the youngest stood upon a stane 

    the eldest cam and push’d her in 



    ‘o sister  sister  reach your hand 

    and ye sall be heir o’ half my land 



    ‘o sister  reach me but your glove 

    and sweet william sall be your love ’



    sometimes she sank  sometimes she swam 

    until she cam to the miller’s dam 



    out then cam the miller’s son 

    and saw the fair maid soummin’ in 



    ‘o father  father  draw your dam 

    there’s either a mermaid or a milk white swan ’



     soummin’  swimming 



    the miller hasted and drew his dam 

    and there he found a drown’d womàn 



    you couldna see her middle sma’ 

    her gowden girdle was sae braw 



    you couldna see her lily feet 

    her gowden fringes were sae deep 



    all amang her yellow hair

    a string o’ pearls was twisted rare 



    you couldna see her fingers sma’ 

    wi’ diamond rings they were cover’d a’ 



    and by there cam a harper fine 

    that harpit to the king at dine 



    and when he look’d that lady on 

    he sigh’d and made a heavy moan 



    he’s made a harp of her breast bane 

    whose sound wad melt a heart of stane 



    he’s ta’en three locks o’ her yellow hair 

    and wi’ them strung his harp sae rare 



    he went into her father’s hall 

    and there was the court assembled all 



    he laid his harp upon a stane 

    and straight it began to play by lane 



    ‘o yonder sits my father  the king 

    and yonder sits my mother  the queen 

    ‘and yonder stands my brother hugh 

    and by him my william  sweet and true ’



    but the last tune that the harp play’d then  

       binnorie  o binnorie  

    was  ‘woe to my sister  false helèn ’

       by the bonnie milldams o’ binnorie  





 377    the bonnie house o’ airlie 



    it fell on a day  and a bonnie simmer day 

      when green grew aits and barley 

    that there fell out a great dispute

      between argyll and airlie 



    argyll has raised an hunder men 

      an hunder harness’d rarely 

    and he’s awa’ by the back of dunkell 

      to plunder the castle of airlie 



    lady ogilvie looks o’er her bower window 

      and o but she looks warely 

    and there she spied the great argyll 

      come to plunder the bonnie house of airlie 



    ‘come down  come down  my lady ogilvie 

      come down and kiss me fairly ’

    ‘o i winna kiss the fause argyll 

      if he shouldna leave a standing stane in airlie ’



    he hath taken her by the left shoulder 

      says  ‘dame  where lies thy dowry ’

    ‘o it’s east and west yon wan water side 

      and it’s down by the banks of the airlie ’





    they hae sought it up  they hae sought it down 

      they hae sought it maist severely 

    till they fand it in the fair plum tree

      that shines on the bowling green of airlie 



    he hath taken her by the middle sae small 

      and o but she grat sairly 

    and laid her down by the bonnie burn side 

      till they plunder’d the castle of airlie 



    ‘gif my gude lord war here this night 

      as he is with king charlie 

    neither you  nor ony ither scottish lord 

      durst avow to the plundering of airlie 



    ‘gif my gude lord war now at hame 

      as he is with his king 

    there durst nae a campbell in a’ argyll

      set fit on airlie green 



    ‘ten bonnie sons i have borne unto him 

      the eleventh ne’er saw his daddy 

    but though i had an hunder mair 

      i’d gie them a’ to king charlie ’

    they hadna been a week from her 

      a week but barely three 

    when word came to the carline wife

      that her sons she’d never see 



    ‘i wish the wind may never cease 

      nor fashes in the flood 

    till my three sons come hame to me 

      in earthly flesh and blood ’



    it fell about the martinmas 

      when nights are lang and mirk 

    the carline wife’s three sons came hame 

      and their hats were o’ the birk 



    it neither grew in syke nor ditch 

      nor yet in ony sheugh 

    but at the gates o’ paradise

      that birk grew fair eneugh 



    ‘blow up the fire  my maidens 

      bring water from the well 

    for a’ my house shall feast this night 

      since my three sons are well ’



    and she has made to them a bed

 382    the seven virgins  



a carol



    all under the leaves and the leaves of life

      i met with virgins seven 

    and one of them was mary mild 

      our lord’s mother of heaven 



    ‘o what are you seeking  you seven fair maids 

      all under the leaves of life 

    come tell  come tell  what seek you

      all under the leaves of life ’



    ‘we’re seeking for no leaves  thomas 

      but for a friend of thine 

    we’re seeking for sweet jesus christ 

      to be our guide and thine ’



    ‘go down  go down  to yonder town 

      and sit in the gallery 

    and there you’ll see sweet jesus christ

      nail’d to a big yew tree ’



    so down they went to yonder town

      as fast as foot could fall 

    and many a grievous bitter tear

      from the virgins’ eyes did fall 



    ‘o peace  mother  o peace  mother 

      your weeping doth me grieve 

    i must suffer this ’ he said 

      ‘for adam and for eve 





    ‘o mother  take you john evangelist

      all for to be your son 

    and he will comfort you sometimes 

      mother  as i have done ’



    ‘o come  thou john evangelist 

      thou’rt welcome unto me 

    but more welcome my own dear son 

      whom i nursed on my knee ’



    then he laid his head on his right shoulder 

      seeing death it struck him nigh  

    ‘the holy ghost be with your soul 

      i die  mother dear  i die ’



    o the rose  the gentle rose 

      and the fennel that grows so green 

    god give us grace in every place

      to pray for our king and queen 



    furthermore for our enemies all

      our prayers they should be strong

    made every youth cry  well a way  

      her name was barbara allen 



    all in the merry month of may 

      when green buds they were swellin’ 

    young jemmy grove on his death bed lay 

      for love of barbara allen 



    he sent his man in to her then 

      to the town where she was dwellin’ 

    ‘o haste and come to my master dear 

      if your name be barbara allen ’



    so slowly  slowly rase she up 

      and slowly she came nigh him 

    and when she drew the curtain by  

      ‘young man  i think you’re dyin’ ’





    ‘o it’s i am sick and very very sick 

      and it’s all for barbara allen ’

    ‘o the better for me ye’se never be 

      tho’ your heart’s blood were a spillin’ 



    ‘o dinna ye mind  young man ’ says she 

      ‘when the red wine ye were fillin’ 

    that ye made the healths go round and round 

      and slighted barbara allen ’



    he turn’d his face unto the wall 

      and death was with him dealin’ 

    ‘adieu  adieu  my dear friends all 

      and be kind to barbara allen ’



    as she was walking o’er the fields 

      she heard the dead bell knellin’ 

    and every jow the dead bell gave

      cried ‘woe to barbara allen ’



    ‘o mother  mother  make my bed 

      o make it saft and narrow 

    my love has died for me to day 

      i’ll die for him to morrow 



    ‘farewell ’ she said  ‘ye virgins all

 391    love will find out the way 



    over the mountains

      and over the waves 

    under the fountains

      and under the graves 

    under floods that are deepest 

      which neptune obey 

    over rocks that are steepest 

      love will find out the way 



    when there is no place

      for the glow worm to lie 

    when there is no space

      for receipt of a fly 

    when the midge dares not venture

      lest herself fast she lay 

    if love come  he will enter

      and will find out the way 





    you may esteem him

      a child for his might 

    or you may deem him

      a coward for his flight 

    but if she whom love doth honour

      be conceal’d from the day  

    set a thousand guards upon her 

      love will find out the way 



    some think to lose him

      by having him confined 

    and some do suppose him 

      poor heart  to be blind 

    but if ne’er so close ye wall him 

      do the best that ye may 

    blind love  if so ye call him 

      he will find out his way 



    you may train the eagle

      to stoop to your fist 

    or you may inveigle

      the phœnix of the east 

    the lioness  you may move her

      to give over her prey 

    but you’ll ne’er stop a lover  

      he will find out the way 



    if the earth it should part him 

      he would gallop it o’er 

    if the seas should o’erthwart him 

      he would swim to the shore 

    should his love become a swallow 

      through the air to stray 

    love will lend wings to follow 

      and will find out the way 





    there is no striving

      to cross his intent 

    there is no contriving

      his plots to prevent 

    but if once the message greet him

      that his true love doth stay 

    if death should come and meet him 

      love will find out the way 





 392    phillada flouts me 



    o what a plague is love 

      how shall i bear it 

    she will inconstant prove 

      i greatly fear it 

    she so torments my mind

      that my strength faileth 

    and wavers with the wind

      as a ship saileth 

    please her the best i may 

    she loves still to gainsay 

    alack and well a day 

      phillada flouts me 



    at the fair yesterday

      she did pass by me 

    she look’d another way

      and would not spy me 

    i woo’d her for to dine 

      but could not get her 

    will had her to the wine  

      he might entreat her 

    with daniel she did dance 

    on me she look’d askance 

    o thrice unhappy chance 

      phillada flouts me 



    fair maid  be not so coy 

      do not disdain me 

    i am my mother’s joy 

      sweet  entertain me 

    she’ll give me  when she dies 

      all that is fitting 

    her poultry and her bees 

      and her goose sitting 

    a pair of mattrass beds 

    and a bag full of shreds 

    and yet  for all this guedes 

      phillada flouts me 



    she hath a clout of mine

      wrought with blue coventry 

    which she keeps for a sign

      of my fidelity 

    but i’ faith  if she flinch

      she shall not wear it 

    to tib  my t’other wench 

      i mean to bear it 

    and yet it grieves my heart

    so soon from her to part 

    death strike me with his dart 

      phillada flouts me 



    thou shalt eat crudded cream

      all the year lasting 



     guedes  goods  property of any kind 



    and drink the crystal stream

      pleasant in tasting 

    whig and whey whilst thou lust 

      and bramble berries 

    pie lid and pastry crust 

      pears  plums  and cherries 

    thy raiment shall be thin 

    made of a weevil’s skin  

    yet all’s not worth a pin 

      phillada flouts me 



    in the last month of may

      i made her posies 

    i heard her often say

      that she loved roses 

    cowslips and gillyflowers

      and the white lily

    i brought to deck the bowers

      for my sweet philly 

    but she did all disdain 

    and threw them back again 

    therefore ’tis flat and plain

      phillada flouts me 



    fair maiden  have a care 

      and in time take me 

    i can have those as fair

      if you forsake me 

    for doll the dairy maid

      laugh’d at me lately 

    and wanton winifred

      favours me greatly 

    one throws milk on my clothes 

    t’other plays with my nose 

    what wanting signs are those 

      phillada flouts me 



    i cannot work nor sleep

      at all in season 

    love wounds my heart so deep

      without all reason 

    i ’gin to pine away

      in my love’s shadow 

    like as a fat beast may 

      penn’d in a meadow 

    i shall be dead  i fear 

    within this thousand year 

    and all for that my dear

      phillada flouts me

      the stars of my undoing 

    or death  in such a bright disguise 

      may tempt a second wooing 



    punish their blind and impious pride 

      who dare contemn thy glory 

    it was my fall that deified

      thy name  and seal’d thy story 



    yet no new sufferings can prepare

      a higher praise to crown thee 

    though my first death proclaim thee fair 

      my second will unthrone thee 



    lovers will doubt thou canst entice

      no other for thy fuel 

    and if thou burn one victim twice 

      both think thee poor and cruel

    when  cœlia  must my old day set 

      and my young morning rise

    in beams of joy so bright as yet

      ne’er bless’d a lover’s eyes 

    my state is more advanced than when

      i first attempted thee 

    i sued to be a servant then 

      but now to be made free 



    i’ve served my time faithful and true 

      expecting to be placed

    in happy freedom  as my due 

      to all the joys thou hast 

    ill husbandry in love is such

      a scandal to love’s power 

    we ought not to misspend so much

      as one poor short lived hour 



    yet think not  sweet  i’m weary grown 

      that i pretend such haste 

    since none to surfeit e’er was known

      before he had a taste 

    my infant love could humbly wait

      when  young  it scarce knew how

    to plead  but grown to man’s estate 

      he is impatient now

    she is a public deity

    she should dispose herself to be

      a petty household god 



    first make the sun in private shine

      and bid the world adieu 

    that so he may his beams confine

      in compliment to you

      think how you did amiss

    thou youngest virgin daughter of the skies 

    made in the last promotion of the blest 

    whose palms  new pluck’d from paradise 

    in spreading branches more sublimely rise 

        rich with immortal green above the rest 

      whether  adopted to some neighbouring star 

      thou roll’st above us  in thy wandering race 

        or  in procession fixt and regular 

        mov’d with the heaven’s majestic pace 

        or  called to more superior bliss 

      thou tread’st with seraphims the vast abyss 

      whatever happy region is thy place 

      cease thy celestial song a little space 

      thou wilt have time enough for hymns divine 

        since heaven’s eternal year is thine 

      hear  then  a mortal muse thy praise rehearse 

                in no ignoble verse 

      but such as thy own voice did practise here 

      when thy first fruits of poesy were given 

      to make thyself a welcome inmate there 

        while yet a young probationer 

                and candidate of heaven 



        if by traduction came thy mind 

        our wonder is the less  to find

      a soul so charming from a stock so good 

      thy father was transfus’d into thy blood 

      so wert thou born into the tuneful strain 

      an early  rich  and inexhausted vein 

        but if thy pre existing soul

        was form’d at first with myriads more 

      it did through all the mighty poets roll

        who greek or latin laurels wore 

    and was that sappho last  which once it was before 

        if so  then cease thy flight  o heaven born mind 

      thou hast no dross to purge from thy rich ore 

        nor can thy soul a fairer mansion find 

      than was the beauteous frame she left behind 

    return  to fill or mend the quire of thy celestial kind 



      may we presume to say  that  at thy birth 

    new joy was sprung in heaven as well as here on earth 

      for sure the milder planets did combine

      on thy auspicious horoscope to shine 

      and even the most malicious were in trine 

        thy brother angels at thy birth

        strung each his lyre  and tun’d it high 

        that all the people of the sky

      might know a poetess was born on earth 

        and then  if ever  mortal ears

        had heard the music of the spheres 

        and if no clust’ring swarm of bees

      on thy sweet mouth distill’d their golden dew 

        ’twas that such vulgar miraclès

        heaven had not leisure to renew 

      for all the blest fraternity of love

    solemniz’d there thy birth  and kept thy holiday above 



        o gracious god  how far have we

      profan’d thy heavenly gift of poesy 

      made prostitute and profligate the muse 

      debas’d to each obscene and impious use 

      whose harmony was first ordain’d above 

      for tongues of angels and for hymns of love 

      o wretched we  why were we hurried down

        this lubrique and adulterate age

       nay  added fat pollutions of our own  

        to increase the streaming ordures of the stage 

      what can we say to excuse our second fall 

      let this thy vestal  heaven  atone for all 

      her arethusian stream remains unsoil’d 

      unmixt with foreign filth  and undefil’d 

    her wit was more than man  her innocence a child 



        art she had none  yet wanted none 

          for nature did that want supply 

        so rich in treasures of her own 

          she might our boasted stores defy 

      such noble vigour did her verse adorn 

      that it seem’d borrowed  where ’twas only born 

      her morals  too  were in her bosom bred 

        by great examples daily fed 

    what in the best of books  her father’s life  she read 

      and to be read herself she need not fear 

      each test  and every light  her muse will bear 

      though epictetus with his lamp were there 

      even love  for love sometimes her muse exprest 

    was but a lambent flame which play’d about her breast 

        light as the vapours of a morning dream 

      so cold herself  whilst she such warmth exprest 

        ’twas cupid bathing in diana’s stream    



        now all those charms  that blooming grace 

      the well proportion’d shape  and beauteous face 

      shall never more be seen by mortal eyes 

      in earth the much lamented virgin lies 

      not wit  nor piety could fate prevent 

      nor was the cruel destiny content

      to finish all the murder at a blow 

      to sweep at once her life and beauty too 

      but  like a hardened felon  took a pride

        to work more mischievously slow 

        and plunder’d first  and then destroyed 

      o double sacrilege on things divine 

      to rob the relic  and deface the shrine 

                but thus orinda died 

      heaven  by the same disease  did both translate 

    as equal were their souls  so equal was their fate 



      meantime  her warlike brother on the seas

      his waving streamers to the winds displays 

    and vows for his return  with vain devotion  pays 

         ah  generous youth  that wish forbear 

         the winds too soon will waft thee here 

         slack all thy sails  and fear to come 

      alas  thou know’st not  thou art wreck’d at home 

      no more shalt thou behold thy sister’s face 

      thou hast already had her last embrace 

      but look aloft  and if thou kenn’st from far 

      among the pleiads a new kindl’d star 

      if any sparkles than the rest more bright 

      ’tis she that shines in that propitious light 



      when in mid air the golden trump shall sound 

        to raise the nations under ground 

      when  in the valley of jehoshaphat 

      the judging god shall close the book of fate 

        and there the last assizes keep

        for those who wake and those who sleep 

        when rattling bones together fly

      from the four corners of the sky 

      when sinews o’er the skeletons are spread 

      those cloth’d with flesh  and life inspires the dead 

      the sacred poets first shall hear the sound 

        and foremost from the tomb shall bound 

      for they are cover’d with the lightest ground 

      and straight  with inborn vigour  on the wing 

    like mounting larks  to the new morning sing 

    there thou  sweet saint  before the quire shalt go 

    as harbinger of heaven  the way to show 

    the way which thou so well hast learn’d below 





 399    a song for st  cecilia’s day  1687 



    from harmony  from heavenly harmony 

          this universal frame began 

      when nature underneath a heap

          of jarring atoms lay 

        and could not heave her head 

    the tuneful voice was heard from high 

        ‘arise  ye more than dead ’

    then cold  and hot  and moist  and dry 

      in order to their stations leap 

          and music’s power obey 

    from harmony  from heavenly harmony 

        this universal frame began 

        from harmony to harmony

    through all the compass of the notes it ran 

    the diapason closing full in man 



    what passion cannot music raise and quell 

        when jubal struck the chorded shell 

      his listening brethren stood around 

        and  wondering  on their faces fell

      to worship that celestial sound 

    less than a god they thought there could not dwell

        within the hollow of that shell 

        that spoke so sweetly  and so well 

    what passion cannot music raise and quell 





        the trumpet’s loud clangour

          excites us to arms 

        with shrill notes of anger 

          and mortal alarms 

      the double double double beat

          of the thundering drum

          cries hark  the foes come 

      charge  charge  ’tis too late to retreat 



      the soft complaining flute 

        in dying notes  discovers

        the woes of hopeless lovers 

    whose dirge is whisper’d by the warbling lute 



        sharp violins proclaim

      their jealous pangs and desperation 

      fury  frantic indignation 

      depth of pains  and height of passion 

        for the fair  disdainful dame 



        but o  what art can teach 

        what human voice can reach 

          the sacred organ’s praise 

        notes inspiring holy love 

      notes that wing their heavenly ways

        to mend the choirs above 



      orpheus could lead the savage race 

      and trees unrooted left their place 

        sequacious of the lyre 

    but bright cecilia rais’d the wonder higher 

    when to her organ vocal breath was given 

      an angel heard  and straight appear’d

        mistaking earth for heaven 





grand chorus 



    as from the power of sacred lays

      the spheres began to move 

    and sung the great creator’s praise

      to all the blest above 

    so when the last and dreadful hour

    this crumbling pageant shall devour 

    the trumpet shall be heard on high 

    the dead shall live  the living die 

    and music shall untune the sky 





 400    ah  how sweet it is to love  



    ah  how sweet it is to love 

      ah  how gay is young desire 

    and what pleasing pains we prove

      when we first approach love’s fire 

    pains of love be sweeter far

    than all other pleasures are 



    sighs which are from lovers blown

      do but gently heave the heart 

    ev’n the tears they shed alone

      cure  like trickling balm  their smart 

    lovers  when they lose their breath 

    bleed away in easy death 



    love and time with reverence use 

      treat them like a parting friend 

    nor the golden gifts refuse

      which in youth sincere they send 

    for each year their price is more 

    and they less simple than before 





    love  like spring tides full and high 

      swells in every youthful vein 

    but each tide does less supply 

      till they quite shrink in again 

    if a flow in age appear 

    ’tis but rain  and runs not clear 





 401    hidden flame 



    i feed a flame within  which so torments me

    that it both pains my heart  and yet contents me 

    ’tis such a pleasing smart  and i so love it 

    that i had rather die than once remove it 



    yet he  for whom i grieve  shall never know it 

    my tongue does not betray  nor my eyes show it 

    not a sigh  nor a tear  my pain discloses 

    but they fall silently  like dew on roses 



    thus  to prevent my love from being cruel 

    my heart’s the sacrifice  as ’tis the fuel 

    and while i suffer this to give him quiet 

    my faith rewards my love  though he deny it 



    on his eyes will i gaze  and there delight me 

    while i conceal my love no frown can fright me 

    to be more happy i dare not aspire 

    nor can i fall more low  mounting no higher 





 402    song to a fair young lady  going out of the town in the spring 



    ask not the cause why sullen spring

      so long delays her flowers to bear 

    why warbling birds forget to sing 

      and winter storms invert the year 

    chloris is gone  and fate provides

    to make it spring where she resides 



    chloris is gone  the cruel fair 

      she cast not back a pitying eye 

    but left her lover in despair

      to sigh  to languish  and to die 

    ah  how can those fair eyes endure

    to give the wounds they will not cure 



    great god of love  why hast thou made

      a face that can all hearts command 

    that all religions can invade 

      and change the laws of every land 

    where thou hadst plac’d such power before 

    thou shouldst have made her mercy more 



    when chloris to the temple comes 

      adoring crowds before her fall 

    she can restore the dead from tombs

      and every life but mine recall 

    i only am by love design’d

    to be the victim for mankind

 403    against indifference 



    more love or more disdain i crave 

      sweet  be not still indifferent 

    o send me quickly to my grave 

      or else afford me more content 

    or love or hate me more or less 

    for love abhors all lukewarmness 



    give me a tempest if ’twill drive

      me to the place where i would be 

    or if you’ll have me still alive 

      confess you will be kind to me 

    give hopes of bliss or dig my grave 

    more love or more disdain i crave

 404    song 



    ladies  though to your conquering eyes

    love owes his chiefest victories 

    and borrows those bright arms from you

    with which he does the world subdue 

    yet you yourselves are not above

    the empire nor the griefs of love 



    then rack not lovers with disdain 

    lest love on you revenge their pain 

    you are not free because you’re fair 

    the boy did not his mother spare 

    beauty’s but an offensive dart 

    it is no armour for the heart 





 405    to a lady asking him how long he would love her 



    it is not  celia  in our power

      to say how long our love will last 

    it may be we within this hour

      may lose those joys we now do taste 

    the blessèd  that immortal be 

    from change in love are only free 



    then since we mortal lovers are 

      ask not how long our love will last 

    but while it does  let us take care

      each minute be with pleasure past 

    were it not madness to deny

    to live because we’re sure to die

 406    news 



        news from a foreign country came

            as if my treasure and my wealth lay there 

        so much it did my heart inflame 

    ’twas wont to call my soul into mine ear 

            which thither went to meet

                the approaching sweet 

            and on the threshold stood

        to entertain the unknown good 

                it hover’d there

            as if ’twould leave mine ear 

        and was so eager to embrace

          the joyful tidings as they came 

        ’twould almost leave its dwelling place

            to entertain that same 



        as if the tidings were the things 

    my very joys themselves  my foreign treasure  

        or else did bear them on their wings  

    with so much joy they came  with so much pleasure 

            my soul stood at that gate

                to recreate

            itself with bliss  and to

        be pleased with speed  a fuller view

                it fain would take 

            yet journeys back would make

        unto my heart  as if ’twould fain

          go out to meet  yet stay within

        to fit a place to entertain

            and bring the tidings in 



        what sacred instinct did inspire

    my soul in childhood with a hope so strong 

        what secret force moved my desire

    to expect my joys beyond the seas  so young 

            felicity i knew

                was out of view 

            and being here alone 

        i saw that happiness was gone

                from me  for this

            i thirsted absent bliss 

        and thought that sure beyond the seas 

          or else in something near at hand  

        i knew not yet  since naught did please

            i knew  my bliss did stand 





        but little did the infant dream

    that all the treasures of the world were by 

        and that himself was so the cream

    and crown of all which round about did lie 

            yet thus it was  the gem 

                the diadem 

            the ring enclosing all

        that stood upon this earthly ball 

                the heavenly eye 

            much wider than the sky 

        wherein they all included were 

          the glorious soul  that was the king

        made to possess them  did appear

            a small and little thing

 407    the sad day 



    o the sad day 

    when friends shall shake their heads  and say

    of miserable me  

    ‘hark  how he groans 

    look  how he pants for breath 

    see how he struggles with the pangs of death ’

    when they shall say of these dear eyes  

    ‘how hollow  o how dim they be 

    mark how his breast doth rise and swell

    against his potent enemy ’

    when some old friend shall step to my bedside 

    touch my chill face  and thence shall gently slide 

    but  when his next companions say

    ‘how does he do  what hopes ’  shall turn away 

    answering only  with a lift up hand  

    ‘who can his fate withstand ’



    then shall a gasp or two do more

    than e’er my rhetoric could before 

    persuade the world to trouble me no more

 408    song 



 written at sea  in the first dutch war  1665   the night before an

engagement  



    to all you ladies now at land

      we men at sea indite 

    but first would have you understand

      how hard it is to write 

    the muses now  and neptune too 

    we must implore to write to you  

        with a fa  la  la  la  la 



    for though the muses should prove kind 

      and fill our empty brain 

    yet if rough neptune rouse the wind

      to wave the azure main 

    our paper  pen  and ink  and we 

    roll up and down our ships at sea  

        with a fa  la  la  la  la 





    then if we write not by each post 

      think not we are unkind 

    nor yet conclude our ships are lost

      by dutchmen or by wind 

    our tears we’ll send a speedier way 

    the tide shall bring them twice a day  

        with a fa  la  la  la  la 



    the king with wonder and surprise

      will swear the seas grow bold 

    because the tides will higher rise

      than e’er they did of old 

    but let him know it is our tears

    bring floods of grief to whitehall stairs  

        with a fa  la  la  la  la 



    should foggy opdam chance to know

      our sad and dismal story 

    the dutch would scorn so weak a foe 

      and quit their fort at goree 

    for what resistance can they find

    from men who’ve left their hearts behind   

        with a fa  la  la  la  la 



    let wind and weather do its worst 

      be you to us but kind 

    let dutchmen vapour  spaniards curse 

      no sorrow we shall find 

    ’tis then no matter how things go 

    or who’s our friend  or who’s our foe  

        with a fa  la  la  la  la 



    to pass our tedious hours away

      we throw a merry main 

    or else at serious ombre play 

      but why should we in vain

    each other’s ruin thus pursue 

    we were undone when we left you  

        with a fa  la  la  la  la 



    but now our fears tempestuous grow

      and cast our hopes away 

    whilst you  regardless of our woe 

      sit careless at a play 

    perhaps permit some happier man

    to kiss your hand  or flirt your fan  

        with a fa  la  la  la  la 



    when any mournful tune you hear 

      that dies in every note

    as if it sigh’d with each man’s care

      for being so remote 

    think then how often love we’ve made

    to you  when all those tunes were play’d  

        with a fa  la  la  la  la 



    in justice you cannot refuse

      to think of our distress 

    when we for hopes of honour lose

      our certain happiness 

    all those designs are but to prove

    ourselves more worthy of your love  

        with a fa  la  la  la  la 



    and now we’ve told you all our loves 

      and likewise all our fears 

    in hopes this declaration moves

      some pity for our tears 

    let’s hear of no inconstancy  

    we have too much of that at sea  

        with a fa  la  la  la  la

 409    to chloris 



    ah  chloris  that i now could sit

      as unconcern’d as when

    your infant beauty could beget

      no pleasure  nor no pain 

    when i the dawn used to admire 

      and praised the coming day 

    i little thought the growing fire

      must take my rest away 



    your charms in harmless childhood lay

      like metals in the mine 

    age from no face took more away

      than youth conceal’d in thine 

    but as your charms insensibly

      to their perfection prest 

    fond love as unperceived did fly 

      and in my bosom rest 



    my passion with your beauty grew 

      and cupid at my heart 

    still as his mother favour’d you 

      threw a new flaming dart 

    each gloried in their wanton part 

      to make a lover  he

    employ’d the utmost of his art  

      to make a beauty  she 





 410    to celia 



    not  celia  that i juster am

      or better than the rest 

    for i would change each hour  like them 

      were not my heart at rest 





    but i am tied to very thee

      by every thought i have 

    thy face i only care to see 

      thy heart i only crave 



    all that in woman is adored

      in thy dear self i find  

    for the whole sex can but afford

      the handsome and the kind 



    why then should i seek further store 

      and still make love anew 

    when change itself can give no more 

      ’tis easy to be true

 411    song 



    love in fantastic triumph sate

      whilst bleeding hearts around him flow’d 

    for whom fresh pains he did create

      and strange tyrannic power he show’d 

    from thy bright eyes he took his fires 

      which round about in sport he hurl’d 

    but ’twas from mine he took desires

      enough t’ undo the amorous world 



    from me he took his sighs and tears 

      from thee his pride and cruelty 

    from me his languishments and fears 

      and every killing dart from thee 

    thus thou and i the god have arm’d

      and set him up a deity 

    but my poor heart alone is harm’d 

      whilst thine the victor is  and free 





 412    the libertine 



    a thousand martyrs i have made 

      all sacrificed to my desire 

    a thousand beauties have betray’d

      that languish in resistless fire 

    the untamed heart to hand i brought 

    and fix’d the wild and wand’ring thought 



    i never vow’d nor sigh’d in vain 

      but both  tho’ false  were well received 

    the fair are pleased to give us pain 

      and what they wish is soon believed 

    and tho’ i talk’d of wounds and smart 

    love’s pleasures only touch’d my heart 



    alone the glory and the spoil

      i always laughing bore away 

    the triumphs without pain or toil 

      without the hell the heaven of joy 

    and while i thus at random rove

    despise the fools that whine for love

 413    return 



    absent from thee  i languish still 

      then ask me not  when i return 

    the straying fool ’twill plainly kill

      to wish all day  all night to mourn 





    dear  from thine arms then let me fly 

      that my fantastic mind may prove

    the torments it deserves to try 

      that tears my fix’d heart from my love 



    when  wearied with a world of woe 

      to thy safe bosom i retire 

    where love  and peace  and truth does flow 

      may i contented there expire 



    lest  once more wandering from that heaven 

      i fall on some base heart unblest 

    faithless to thee  false  unforgiven  

      and lose my everlasting rest 





 414    love and life 



    all my past life is mine no more 

      the flying hours are gone 

    like transitory dreams given o’er 

    whose images are kept in store

      by memory alone 



    the time that is to come is not 

      how can it then be mine 

    the present moment’s all my lot 

    and that  as fast as it is got 

      phillis  is only thine 



    then talk not of inconstancy 

      false hearts  and broken vows 

    if i by miracle can be

    this live long minute true to thee 

      ’tis all that heaven allows 





 415    constancy 



    i cannot change as others do 

      though you unjustly scorn 

    since that poor swain that sighs for you

      for you alone was born 

    no  phillis  no  your heart to move

      a surer way i’ll try 

    and  to revenge my slighted love 

      will still love on and die 



    when kill’d with grief amyntas lies 

      and you to mind shall call

    the sighs that now unpitied rise 

      the tears that vainly fall  

    that welcome hour  that ends this smart 

      will then begin your pain 

    for such a faithful tender heart

      can never break in vain 





 416    to his mistress 



  after quarles  



    why dost thou shade thy lovely face  o why

    does that eclipsing hand of thine deny

    the sunshine of the sun’s enlivening eye 



    without thy light what light remains in me 

    thou art my life  my way  my light’s in thee 

    i live  i move  and by thy beams i see 



    thou art my life  if thou but turn away

    my life’s a thousand deaths  thou art my way  

    without thee  love  i travel not but stray 





    my light thou art  without thy glorious sight

    my eyes are darken’d with eternal night 

    my love  thou art my way  my life  my light 



    thou art my way  i wander if thou fly 

    thou art my light  if hid  how blind am i 

    thou art my life  if thou withdraw’st  i die 



    my eyes are dark and blind  i cannot see 

    to whom or whither should my darkness flee 

    but to that light   and who’s that light but thee 



    if i have lost my path  dear lover  say 

    shall i still wander in a doubtful way 

    love  shall a lamb of israel’s sheepfold stray 



    my path is lost  my wandering steps do stray 

    i cannot go  nor can i safely stay 

    whom should i seek but thee  my path  my way 



    and yet thou turn’st thy face away and fly’st me 

    and yet i sue for grace and thou deny’st me 

    speak  art thou angry  love  or only try’st me 



    thou art the pilgrim’s path  the blind man’s eye 

    the dead man’s life  on thee my hopes rely 

    if i but them remove  i surely die 



    dissolve thy sunbeams  close thy wings and stay 

    see  see how i am blind  and dead  and stray 

      o thou that art my life  my light  my way 



    then work thy will  if passion bid me flee 

    my reason shall obey  my wings shall be

    stretch’d out no farther than from me to thee

 417    the reconcilement 



    come  let us now resolve at last

      to live and love in quiet 

    we’ll tie the knot so very fast

      that time shall ne’er untie it 



    the truest joys they seldom prove

      who free from quarrels live 

    ’tis the most tender part of love

      each other to forgive 



    when least i seem’d concern’d  i took

      no pleasure nor no rest 

    and when i feign’d an angry look 

      alas  i loved you best 



    own but the same to me  you’ll find

      how blest will be our fate 

    o to be happy  to be kind  

      sure never is too late 





 418    on one who died discovering her kindness 



    some vex their souls with jealous pain 

    while others sigh for cold disdain 

    love’s various slaves we daily see  

    yet happy all compared with me 





    of all mankind i loved the best

    a nymph so far above the rest

    that we outshined the blest above 

    in beauty she  as i in love 



    and therefore they  who could not bear

    to be outdone by mortals here 

    among themselves have placed her now 

    and left me wretched here below 



    all other fate i could have borne 

    and even endured her very scorn 

    but oh  thus all at once to find

    that dread account  both dead and kind 

    what heart can hold  if yet i live 

    ’tis but to show how much i grieve

 419    the enchantment 



    i did but look and love awhile 

      ’twas but for one half hour 

    then to resist i had no will 

      and now i have no power 



    to sigh and wish is all my ease 

      sighs which do heat impart

    enough to melt the coldest ice 

      yet cannot warm your heart 



    o would your pity give my heart

      one corner of your breast 

    ’twould learn of yours the winning art 

      and quickly steal the rest

 420    a quiet soul 



    thy soul within such silent pomp did keep 

      as if humanity were lull’d asleep 

    so gentle was thy pilgrimage beneath 

      time’s unheard feet scarce make less noise 

      or the soft journey which a planet goes 

    life seem’d all calm as its last breath 

      a still tranquillity so hush’d thy breast 

        as if some halcyon were its guest 

        and there had built her nest 

      it hardly now enjoys a greater rest

    only tell her that i love 

      leave the rest to her and fate 

    some kind planet from above

    may perhaps her pity move 

      lovers on their stars must wait   

    only tell her that i love 



    why  o why should i despair 

      mercy’s pictured in her eye 

    if she once vouchsafe to hear 

    welcome hope and farewell fear 

      she’s too good to let me die   

    why  o why should i despair

 422    the question to lisetta 



    what nymph should i admire or trust 

    but chloe beauteous  chloe just 

    what nymph should i desire to see 

    but her who leaves the plain for me 

    to whom should i compose the lay 

    but her who listens when i play 

    to whom in song repeat my cares 

    but her who in my sorrow shares 

    for whom should i the garland make 

    but her who joys the gift to take 

    and boasts she wears it for my sake 

    in love am i not fully blest 

    lisetta  prithee tell the rest 





lisetta’s reply



    sure chloe just  and chloe fair 

    deserves to be your only care 

    but  when you and she to day

    far into the wood did stray 

    and i happened to pass by 

    which way did you cast your eye 

    but  when your cares to her you sing 

    you dare not tell her whence they spring 

    does it not more afflict your heart 

    that in those cares she bears a part 

    when you the flowers for chloe twine 

    why do you to her garland join

    the meanest bud that falls from mine 

    simplest of swains  the world may see

    whom chloe loves  and who loves me

    lords  knights  and squires  the numerous band

      that wear the fair miss mary’s fetters 

    were summoned by her high command

      to show their passions by their letters 



    my pen amongst the rest i took 

      lest those bright eyes  that cannot read 

    should dart their kindling fire  and look

      the power they have to be obey’d 



    nor quality  nor reputation 

      forbid me yet my flame to tell 

    dear five years old befriends my passion 

      and i may write till she can spell 



    for  while she makes her silkworms beds

      with all the tender things i swear 

    whilst all the house my passion reads 

      in papers round her baby’s hair 



    she may receive and own my flame 

      for  though the strictest prudes should know it 

    she’ll pass for a most virtuous dame 

      and i for an unhappy poet 



    then too  alas  when she shall tear

      the rhymes some younger rival sends 

    she’ll give me leave to write  i fear 

      and we shall still continue friends 



    for  as our different ages move 

      ’tis so ordain’d  would fate but mend it   

    that i shall be past making love

      when she begins to comprehend it

    the merchant  to secure his treasure 

      conveys it in a borrow’d name 

    euphelia serves to grace my measure 

      but chloe is my real flame 



    my softest verse  my darling lyre 

      upon euphelia’s toilet lay 

    when chloe noted her desire

      that i should sing  that i should play 



    my lyre i tune  my voice i raise 

      but with my numbers mix my sighs 

    and while i sing euphelia’s praise 

      i fix my soul on chloe’s eyes 



    fair chloe blush’d  euphelia frown’d 

      i sung  and gazed  i play’d  and trembled 

    and venus to the loves around

      remark’d  how ill we all dissembled 





 425    on my birthday  july 21 



    i  my dear  was born to day  

    so all my jolly comrades say 

    they bring me music  wreaths  and mirth 

    and ask to celebrate my birth 

    little  alas  my comrades know

    that i was born to pain and woe 

    to thy denial  to thy scorn 

    better i had ne’er been born 

    i wish to die  even whilst i say  

    ‘i  my dear  was born to day ’





    i  my dear  was born to day 

    shall i salute the rising ray 

    well spring of all my joy and woe 

    clotilda  thou alone dost know 

    shall the wreath surround my hair 

    or shall the music please my ear 

    shall i my comrades’ mirth receive 

    and bless my birth  and wish to live 

    then let me see great venus chase

    imperious anger from thy face 

    then let me hear thee smiling say  

    ‘thou  my dear  wert born to day ’





 426    the lady who offers her looking glass to venus 



    venus  take my votive glass

 427    a letter 



 to lady margaret cavendish holles harley  when a child 



    my noble  lovely  little peggy 

    let this my first epistle beg ye 

    at dawn of morn  and close of even 

    to lift your heart and hands to heaven 

    in double duty say your prayer 

     our father  first  then  notre père  





    and  dearest child  along the day 

    in every thing you do and say 

    obey and please my lord and lady 

    so god shall love and angels aid ye 



    if to these precepts you attend 

    no second letter need i send 

    and so i rest your constant friend 





 428    for my own monument 



    as doctors give physic by way of prevention 

      mat  alive and in health  of his tombstone took care 

    for delays are unsafe  and his pious intention

      may haply be never fulfill’d by his heir 



    then take mat’s word for it  the sculptor is paid 

      that the figure is fine  pray believe your own eye 

    yet credit but lightly what more may be said 

      for we flatter ourselves  and teach marble to lie 



    yet counting as far as to fifty his years 

      his virtues and vices were as other men’s are 

    high hopes he conceived  and he smother’d great fears 

      in a life parti colour’d  half pleasure  half care 



    nor to business a drudge  nor to faction a slave 

      he strove to make interest and freedom agree 

    in public employments industrious and grave 

      and alone with his friends  lord  how merry was he 



    now in equipage stately  now humbly on foot 

      both fortunes he tried  but to neither would trust 

    and whirl’d in the round as the wheel turn’d about 

      he found riches had wings  and knew man was but dust 





    this verse  little polish’d  tho’ mighty sincere 

      sets neither his titles nor merit to view 

    it says that his relics collected lie here 

      and no mortal yet knows too if this may be true 



    fierce robbers there are that infest the highway 

      so mat may be kill’d  and his bones never found 

    false witness at court  and fierce tempests at sea 

      so mat may yet chance to be hang’d or be drown’d 



    if his bones lie in earth  roll in sea  fly in air 

      to fate we must yield  and the thing is the same 

    and if passing thou giv’st him a smile or a tear 

      he cares not  yet  prithee  be kind to his fame

    careless she is  with artful care 

      affecting to seem unaffected 



    with skill her eyes dart ev’ry glance 

      yet change so soon you’d ne’er suspect them 

    for she’d persuade they wound by chance 

      tho’ certain aim and art direct them 



    she likes herself  yet others hates

      for that which in herself she prizes 

    and  while she laughs at them  forgets

      she is the thing that she despises

    the spacious firmament on high 

    with all the blue ethereal sky 

    and spangled heavens  a shining frame 

    their great original proclaim 

    th’ unwearied sun from day to day

    does his creator’s power display 

    and publishes to every land

    the work of an almighty hand 





    soon as the evening shades prevail 

    the moon takes up the wondrous tale 

    and nightly to the listening earth

    repeats the story of her birth 

    whilst all the stars that round her burn 

    and all the planets in their turn 

    confirm the tidings as they roll 

    and spread the truth from pole to pole 



    what though in solemn silence all

    move round the dark terrestrial ball 

    what though nor real voice nor sound

    amidst their radiant orbs be found 

    in reason’s ear they all rejoice 

    and utter forth a glorious voice 

    for ever singing as they shine 

    ‘the hand that made us is divine ’

 434    the day of judgement 



    when the fierce north wind with his airy forces

    rears up the baltic to a foaming fury 

    and the red lightning with a storm of hail comes

                        rushing amain down 



    how the poor sailors stand amazed and tremble 

    while the hoarse thunder  like a bloody trumpet 

    roars a loud onset to the gaping waters

                        quick to devour them 





    such shall the noise be  and the wild disorder

     if things eternal may be like these earthly  

    such the dire terror when the great archangel

                        shakes the creation 



    tears the strong pillars of the vault of heaven 

    breaks up old marble  the repose of princes 

    sees the graves open  and the bones arising 

                        flames all around them 



    hark  the shrill outcries of the guilty wretches 

    lively bright horror and amazing anguish

    stare thro’ their eyelids  while the living worm lies

                        gnawing within them 



    thoughts  like old vultures  prey upon their heart strings 

    and the smart twinges  when the eye beholds the

    lofty judge frowning  and a flood of vengeance

                        rolling afore him 



    hopeless immortals  how they scream and shiver 

    while devils push them to the pit wide yawning

    hideous and gloomy  to receive them headlong

                        down to the centre 



    stop here  my fancy   all away  ye horrid

    doleful ideas   come  arise to jesus 

    how he sits god like  and the saints around him

                        throned  yet adoring 



    o may i sit there when he comes triumphant 

    dooming the nations  then ascend to glory 

    while our hosannas all along the passage

                        shout the redeemer 





 435    a cradle hymn 



    hush  my dear  lie still and slumber 

      holy angels guard thy bed 

    heavenly blessings without number

      gently falling on thy head 



    sleep  my babe  thy food and raiment 

      house and home  thy friends provide 

    all without thy care or payment 

      all thy wants are well supplied 



    how much better thou’rt attended

      than the son of god could be 

    when from heaven he descended

      and became a child like thee 



    soft and easy is thy cradle 

      coarse and hard thy saviour lay 

    when his birthplace was a stable

      and his softest bed was hay 



    blessèd babe  what glorious features  

      spotless fair  divinely bright 

    must he dwell with brutal creatures 

      how could angels bear the sight 



    was there nothing but a manger

      cursèd sinners could afford

    to receive the heavenly stranger 

      did they thus affront their lord 





    soft  my child  i did not chide thee 

      though my song might sound too hard 

    ’tis thy mother sits beside thee 

      and her arms shall be thy guard 



    yet to read the shameful story

      how the jews abused their king 

    how they served the lord of glory 

      makes me angry while i sing 



    see the kinder shepherds round him 

      telling wonders from the sky 

    where they sought him  there they found him 

      with his virgin mother by 



    see the lovely babe a dressing 

      lovely infant  how he smiled 

    when he wept  the mother’s blessing

      soothed and hush’d the holy child 



    lo  he slumbers in his manger 

      where the hornèd oxen fed 

    peace  my darling  here’s no danger 

      here’s no ox anear thy bed 



    ’twas to save thee  child  from dying 

      save my dear from burning flame 

    bitter groans and endless crying 

      that thy blest redeemer came 



    may’st thou live to know and fear him 

      trust and love him all thy days 

    then go dwell for ever near him 

      see his face  and sing his praise

 436    song 



        when thy beauty appears

        in its graces and airs

    all bright as an angel new dropp’d from the sky 

    at distance i gaze and am awed by my fears 

        so strangely you dazzle my eye 



        but when without art

        your kind thoughts you impart 

    when your love runs in blushes through every vein 

    when it darts from your eyes  when it pants in your heart 

        then i know you’re a woman again 



        there’s a passion and pride

        in our sex  she replied  

    and thus  might i gratify both  i would do 

    still an angel appear to each lover beside 

        but still be a woman to you

    fair as the day  and sweet as may 

    fair as the day  and always gay 

      my peggy is a young thing

        the wawking of the fauld 



      my peggy speaks sae sweetly

        whene’er we meet alane 

    i wish nae mair to lay my care 

    i wish nae mair of a’ that’s rare 

      my peggy speaks sae sweetly

        at wawking of the fauld 



      my peggy smiles sae kindly

        whene’er i whisper love 

    that i look down on a’ the town 

    that i look down upon a crown 

      my peggy smiles sae kindly 

        it makes me blyth and bauld 

      and naething gi’es me sic delight

        as wawking of the fauld 



      my peggy sings sae saftly

        when on my pipe i play 

    by a’ the rest it is confest 

    by a’ the rest  that she sings best 

      my peggy sings sae saftly 

        and in her sangs are tauld

      with innocence the wale of sense 

        at wawking of the fauld

    busy  curious  thirsty fly 

    drink with me and drink as i 

    freely welcome to my cup 

    couldst thou sip and sip it up 

    make the most of life you may 

    life is short and wears away 



    both alike are mine and thine

    hastening quick to their decline 

    thine’s a summer  mine’s no more 

    though repeated to threescore 

    threescore summers  when they’re gone 

    will appear as short as one

    o ruddier than the cherry 

    o sweeter than the berry 

        o nymph more bright

        than moonshine night 

    like kidlings blithe and merry 

    ripe as the melting cluster 

    no lily has such lustre 

        yet hard to tame

        as raging flame 

    and fierce as storms that bluster

 440    on a certain lady at court 



    i know a thing that’s most uncommon 

       envy  be silent and attend  

    i know a reasonable woman 

      handsome and witty  yet a friend 



    not warp’d by passion  awed by rumour 

      not grave through pride  nor gay through folly 

    an equal mixture of good humour

      and sensible soft melancholy 



    ‘has she no faults then  envy says   sir ’

      yes  she has one  i must aver 

    when all the world conspires to praise her 

      the woman’s deaf  and does not hear 





 441    elegy to the memory of an unfortunate lady 



    what beck’ning ghost  along the moonlight shade

    invites my steps  and points to yonder glade 

    ’tis she   but why that bleeding bosom gored 

    why dimly gleams the visionary sword 

    o  ever beauteous  ever friendly  tell 

    is it  in heav’n  a crime to love too well 

    to bear too tender or too firm a heart 

    to act a lover’s or a roman’s part 

    is there no bright reversion in the sky

    for those who greatly think  or bravely die 

      why bade ye else  ye pow’rs  her soul aspire

    above the vulgar flight of low desire 

    ambition first sprung from your blest abodes 

    the glorious fault of angels and of gods 

    thence to their images on earth it flows 

    and in the breasts of kings and heroes glows 

    most souls  ’tis true  but peep out once an age 

    dull sullen pris’ners in the body’s cage 

    dim lights of life  that burn a length of years 

    useless  unseen  as lamps in sepulchres 

    like eastern kings a lazy state they keep 

    and close confined to their own palace  sleep 

      from these perhaps  ere nature bade her die 

    fate snatch’d her early to the pitying sky 

    as into air the purer spirits flow 

    and sep’rate from their kindred dregs below 

    so flew the soul to its congenial place 

    nor left one virtue to redeem her race 

      but thou  false guardian of a charge too good 

    thou  mean deserter of thy brother’s blood 

    see on these ruby lips the trembling breath 

    these cheeks now fading at the blast of death 

    cold is that breast which warm’d the world before 

    and those love darting eyes must roll no more 

    thus  if eternal justice rules the ball 

    thus shall your wives  and thus your children fall 

    on all the line a sudden vengeance waits 

    and frequent herses shall besiege your gates 

    there passengers shall stand  and pointing say

     while the long fun’rals blacken all the way  

    ‘lo  these were they whose souls the furies steel’d

    and cursed with hearts unknowing how to yield ’

    thus unlamented pass the proud away 

    the gaze of fools  and pageant of a day 

    so perish all whose breast ne’er learn’d to glow

    for others’ good  or melt at others’ woe 

      what can atone  o ever injured shade  

    thy fate unpitied  and thy rites unpaid 

    no friend’s complaint  no kind domestic tear

    pleased thy pale ghost  or graced thy mournful bier 

    by foreign hands thy dying eyes were closed 

    by foreign hands thy decent limbs composed 

    by foreign hands thy humble grave adorn’d 

    by strangers honour’d  and by strangers mourn’d 

    what tho’ no friends in sable weeds appear 

    grieve for an hour  perhaps  then mourn a year 

    and bear about the mockery of woe

    to midnight dances  and the public show 

    what tho’ no weeping loves thy ashes grace 

    nor polish’d marble emulate thy face 

    what tho’ no sacred earth allow thee room 

    nor hallow’d dirge be mutter’d o’er thy tomb 

    yet shall thy grave with rising flow’rs be drest 

    and the green turf lie lightly on thy breast 

    there shall the morn her earliest tears bestow 

    there the first roses of the year shall blow 

    while angels with their silver wings o’ershade

    the ground now sacred by thy reliques made 

      so peaceful rests  without a stone  a name 

    what once had beauty  titles  wealth  and fame 

    how loved  how honour’d once  avails thee not 

    to whom related  or by whom begot 

    a heap of dust alone remains of thee 

    ’tis all thou art  and all the proud shall be 

      poets themselves must fall  like those they sung 

    deaf the praised ear  and mute the tuneful tongue 

    ev’n he  whose soul now melts in mournful lays 

    shall shortly want the gen’rous tear he pays 

    then from his closing eyes thy form shall part 

    and the last pang shall tear thee from his heart 

    life’s idle business at one gasp be o’er 

    the muse forgot  and thou beloved no more 





 442    the dying christian to his soul 



      vital spark of heav’nly flame 

      quit  o quit this mortal frame 

      trembling  hoping  lingering  flying 

      o the pain  the bliss of dying 

    cease  fond nature  cease thy strife 

    and let me languish into life 



      hark  they whisper  angels say 

      sister spirit  come away 

      what is this absorbs me quite 

      steals my senses  shuts my sight 

    drowns my spirits  draws my breath 

    tell me  my soul  can this be death 



    the world recedes  it disappears 

    heav’n opens on my eyes  my ears

      with sounds seraphic ring 

    lend  lend your wings  i mount  i fly 

    o grave  where is thy victory 

      o death  where is thy sting

 443    shorten sail 



    love thy country  wish it well 

      not with too intense a care 

    ’tis enough that  when it fell 

      thou its ruin didst not share 



    envy’s censure  flattery’s praise 

      with unmoved indifference view 

    learn to tread life’s dangerous maze

      with unerring virtue’s clue 



    void of strong desire and fear 

      life’s wide ocean trust no more 

    strive thy little bark to steer

      with the tide  but near the shore 



    thus prepared  thy shorten’d sail

      shall  whene’er the winds increase 

    seizing each propitious gale 

      waft thee to the port of peace 



    keep thy conscience from offence

      and tempestuous passions free 

    so  when thou art call’d from hence 

      easy shall thy passage be 



      easy shall thy passage be 

      cheerful thy allotted stay 

    short the account ’twixt god and thee 

      hope shall meet thee on thy way

 444    sally in our alley 



    of all the girls that are so smart

      there’s none like pretty sally 

    she is the darling of my heart 

      and she lives in our alley 

    there is no lady in the land

      is half so sweet as sally 

    she is the darling of my heart 

      and she lives in our alley 



    her father he makes cabbage nets 

      and through the streets does cry ’em 

    her mother she sells laces long

      to such as please to buy ’em 

    but sure such folks could ne’er beget

      so sweet a girl as sally 

    she is the darling of my heart 

      and she lives in our alley 



    when she is by  i leave my work 

      i love her so sincerely 

    my master comes like any turk 

      and bangs me most severely 

    but let him bang his bellyful 

      i’ll bear it all for sally 

    she is the darling of my heart 

      and she lives in our alley 



    of all the days that’s in the week

      i dearly love but one day  

    and that’s the day that comes betwixt

      a saturday and monday 

    for then i’m drest all in my best

      to walk abroad with sally 

    she is the darling of my heart 

      and she lives in our alley 



    my master carries me to church 

      and often am i blamèd

    because i leave him in the lurch

      as soon as text is namèd 

    i leave the church in sermon time

      and slink away to sally 

    she is the darling of my heart 

      and she lives in our alley 



    when christmas comes about again 

      o  then i shall have money 

    i’ll hoard it up  and box it all 

      i’ll give it to my honey 

    i would it were ten thousand pound 

      i’d give it all to sally 

    she is the darling of my heart 

      and she lives in our alley 



    my master and the neighbours all

      make game of me and sally 

    and  but for her  i’d better be

      a slave and row a galley 

    but when my seven long years are out 

      o  then i’ll marry sally 

    o  then we’ll wed  and then we’ll bed  

      but not in our alley 





 445    a drinking song 



    bacchus must now his power resign  

    i am the only god of wine 

    it is not fit the wretch should be

    in competition set with me 

    who can drink ten times more than he 



    make a new world  ye powers divine 

    stock’d with nothing else but wine 

    let wine its only product be 

    let wine be earth  and air  and sea  

    and let that wine be all for me

    queen of fragrance  lovely rose 

    the beauties of thy leaves disclose 

      but thou  fair nymph  thyself survey

    in this sweet offspring of a day 

    that miracle of face must fail 

    thy charms are sweet  but charms are frail 

    swift as the short lived flower they fly 

    at morn they bloom  at evening die 

    though sickness yet a while forbears 

    yet time destroys what sickness spares 

    now helen lives alone in fame 

    and cleopatra’s but a name 

    time must indent that heavenly brow 

    and thou must be what they are now 





 447    belinda’s recovery from sickness 



    thus when the silent grave becomes

    pregnant with life as fruitful wombs 

    when the wide seas and spacious earth

      resign us to our second birth 

    our moulder’d frame rebuilt assumes

    new beauty  and for ever blooms 

    and  crown’d with youth’s immortal pride 

      we angels rise  who mortals died

    dragg’d ling’ring on from partial death to death 

    till  dying  all he can resign is  breath

    no other voice than hers can hear 

    no other wit but hers approve 

    tell me  my heart  if this be love 



    if she some other youth commend 

    though i was once his fondest friend 

    his instant enemy i prove 

    tell me  my heart  if this be love 



    when she is absent  i no more

    delight in all that pleased before  

    the clearest spring  or shadiest grove 

    tell me  my heart  if this be love 



    when fond of power  of beauty vain 

    her nets she spread for every swain 

    i strove to hate  but vainly strove 

    tell me  my heart  if this be love

    long expected one and twenty 

      ling’ring year  at length is flown 

    pride and pleasure  pomp and plenty 

      great           are now your own

    wild as wind  and light as feather

    call the betsies  kates  and jennies 

      all the names that banish care 

    lavish of your grandsire’s guineas 

      show the spirit of an heir 



    all that prey on vice and folly

      joy to see their quarry fly 

    there the gamester  light and jolly 

      there the lender  grave and sly 



    wealth  my lad  was made to wander 

      let it wander as it will 

    call the jockey  call the pander 

      bid them come and take their fill 



    when the bonny blade carouses 

      pockets full  and spirits high  

    what are acres  what are houses 

      only dirt  or wet or dry

      tell the woes of wilful waste 

    scorn their counsel  scorn their pother

 451    on the death of mr  robert levet  a practiser in physic 



    condemn’d to hope’s delusive mine 

      as on we toil from day to day 

    by sudden blasts or slow decline

      our social comforts drop away 





    well tried through many a varying year 

      see levet to the grave descend 

    officious  innocent  sincere 

      of every friendless name the friend 



    yet still he fills affection’s eye 

      obscurely wise and coarsely kind 

    nor  lettered arrogance  deny

      thy praise to merit unrefined 



    when fainting nature call’d for aid 

      and hov’ring death prepared the blow 

    his vig’rous remedy display’d

      the power of art without the show 



    in misery’s darkest cavern known 

      his useful care was ever nigh 

    where hopeless anguish pour’d his groan 

      and lonely want retired to die 



    no summons mock’d by chill delay 

      no petty gain disdain’d by pride 

    the modest wants of every day

      the toil of every day supplied 



    his virtues walk’d their narrow round 

      nor made a pause  nor left a void 

    and sure th’ eternal master found

      the single talent well employ’d 



    the busy day  the peaceful night 

      unfelt  uncounted  glided by 

    his frame was firm  his powers were bright 

      though now his eightieth year was nigh 





    then with no fiery throbbing pain 

      no cold gradations of decay 

    death broke at once the vital chain 

      and freed his soul the nearest way

 453    elegy written in a country churchyard 



    the curfew tolls the knell of parting day 

      the lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea 

    the plowman homeward plods his weary way 

      and leaves the world to darkness and to me 



    now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight 

      and all the air a solemn stillness holds 

    save where the beetle wheels his droning flight 

      and drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds 

    save that from yonder ivy mantled tow’r

      the moping owl does to the moon complain

    of such as  wand’ring near her secret bow’r 

      molest her ancient solitary reign 



    beneath those rugged elms  that yew tree’s shade 

      where heaves the turf in many a mould’ring heap 

    each in his narrow cell for ever laid 

      the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep 



    the breezy call of incense breathing morn 

      the swallow twitt’ring from the straw built shed 

    the cock’s shrill clarion  or the echoing horn 

      no more shall rouse them from their lowly bed 



    for them no more the blazing hearth shall burn 

      or busy housewife ply her evening care 

    no children run to lisp their sire’s return 

      or climb his knees the envied kiss to share 



    oft did the harvest to their sickle yield 

      their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke 

    how jocund did they drive their team afield 

      how bow’d the woods beneath their sturdy stroke 



    let not ambition mock their useful toil 

      their homely joys  and destiny obscure 

    nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile

      the short and simple annals of the poor 



    the boast of heraldry  the pomp of pow’r 

      and all that beauty  all that wealth e’er gave 

    awaits alike th’ inevitable hour 

      the paths of glory lead but to the grave 





    nor you  ye proud  impute to these the fault 

      if memory o’er their tomb no trophies raise 

    where through the long drawn aisle and fretted vault

      the pealing anthem swells the note of praise 



    can storied urn or animated bust

      back to its mansion call the fleeting breath 

    can honour’s voice provoke the silent dust 

      or flatt’ry soothe the dull cold ear of death 



    perhaps in this neglected spot is laid

      some heart once pregnant with celestial fire 

    hands  that the rod of empire might have sway’d 

      or waked to ecstasy the living lyre 



    but knowledge to their eyes her ample page

      rich with the spoils of time did ne’er unroll 

    chill penury repress’d their noble rage 

      and froze the genial current of the soul 



    full many a gem of purest ray serene

      the dark unfathom’d caves of ocean bear 

    full many a flower is born to blush unseen 

      and waste its sweetness on the desert air 



    some village hampden that with dauntless breast

      the little tyrant of his fields withstood 

    some mute inglorious milton here may rest 

      some cromwell guiltless of his country’s blood 



    th’ applause of list’ning senates to command 

      the threats of pain and ruin to despise 

    to scatter plenty o’er a smiling land 

      and read their history in a nation’s eyes 

    their lot forbade  nor circumscribed alone

      their growing virtues  but their crimes confined 

    forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne 

      and shut the gates of mercy on mankind 



    the struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide 

      to quench the blushes of ingenuous shame 

    or heap the shrine of luxury and pride

      with incense kindled at the muse’s flame 



    far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife

      their sober wishes never learn’d to stray 

    along the cool sequester’d vale of life

      they kept the noiseless tenor of their way 



    yet ev’n these bones from insult to protect

      some frail memorial still erected nigh 

    with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck’d 

      implores the passing tribute of a sigh 



    their name  their years  spelt by th’ unletter’d muse 

      the place of fame and elegy supply 

    and many a holy text around she strews 

      that teach the rustic moralist to die 



    for who  to dumb forgetfulness a prey 

      this pleasing anxious being e’er resign’d 

    left the warm precincts of the cheerful day 

      nor cast one longing ling’ring look behind 



    on some fond breast the parting soul relies 

      some pious drops the closing eye requires 

    e’en from the tomb the voice of nature cries 

      e’en in our ashes live their wonted fires 





    for thee  who  mindful of th’ unhonour’d dead 

      dost in these lines their artless tale relate 

    if chance  by lonely contemplation led 

      some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate 



    haply some hoary headed swain may say 

      ‘oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn

    brushing with hasty steps the dews away

      to meet the sun upon the upland lawn 



    ‘there at the foot of yonder nodding beech

      that wreathes its old fantastic roots so high 

    his listless length at noontide would he stretch 

      and pore upon the brook that babbles by 



    ‘hard by yon wood  now smiling as in scorn 

      mutt’ring his wayward fancies he would rove 

    now drooping  woeful wan  like one forlorn 

      or crazed with care  or cross’d in hopeless love 



    ‘one morn i miss’d him on the custom’d hill 

      along the heath and near his fav’rite tree 

    another came  nor yet beside the rill 

      nor up the lawn  nor at the wood was he 



    ‘the next with dirges due in sad array

      slow through the church way path we saw him borne 

    approach and read  for thou canst read  the lay

      graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn ’





 the epitaph  



     here rests his head upon the lap of earth 

       a youth to fortune and to fame unknown  

     fair science frown’d not on his humble birth  

       and melancholy marked him for her own  





     large was his bounty  and his soul sincere  

       heav’n did a recompense as largely send  

     he gave to mis’ry all he had  a tear  

       he gain’d from heav’n  ’twas all he wish’d  a friend  



     no farther seek his merits to disclose  

       or draw his frailties from their dread abode  

      there they alike in trembling hope repose   

       the bosom of his father and his god

      weave the warp  and weave the woof 

    the winding sheet of edward’s race 

      give ample room  and verge enough

    the characters of hell to trace 

    mark the year  and mark the night 

    when severn shall re echo with affright

    the shrieks of death  thro’ berkley’s roofs that ring 

    shrieks of an agonizing king 

      she wolf of france  with unrelenting fangs 

    that tear’st the bowels of thy mangled mate 

      from thee be born  who o’er thy country hangs

    the scourge of heav’n  what terrors round him wait 

    amazement in his van  with flight combined 

    and sorrow’s faded form  and solitude behind 



      mighty victor  mighty lord 

    low on his funeral couch he lies 

      no pitying heart  no eye  afford

    a tear to grace his obsequies 

    is the sable warrior fled 

    thy son is gone  he rests among the dead 

    the swarm that in thy noon tide beam were born 

    gone to salute the rising morn 

    fair laughs the morn  and soft the zephyr blows 

    while proudly riding o’er the azure realm

    in gallant trim the gilded vessel goes 

      youth on the prow  and pleasure at the helm 

    regardless of the sweeping whirlwind’s sway 

    that  hush’d in grim repose  expects his evening prey 



      fill high the sparkling bowl 

    the rich repast prepare 

      reft of a crown  he yet may share the feast 

    close by the regal chair

      fell thirst and famine scowl

      a baleful smile upon their baffled guest 

    heard ye the din of battle bray 

      lance to lance  and horse to horse 

      long years of havoc urge their destined course 

    and thro’ the kindred squadrons mow their way 

      ye towers of julius  london’s lasting shame 

    with many a foul and midnight murder fed 

      revere his consort’s faith  his father’s fame 

    and spare the meek usurper’s holy head 

    above  below  the rose of snow 

      twined with her blushing foe  we spread 

    the bristled boar in infant gore

      wallows beneath the thorny shade 

    now  brothers  bending o’er th’ accursèd loom

    stamp we our vengeance deep  and ratify his doom 



      edward  lo  to sudden fate

     weave we the woof  the thread is spun 

      half of thy heart we consecrate

a pindaric ode



      awake  æolian lyre  awake 

    and give to rapture all thy trembling strings 

    from helicon’s harmonious springs

      a thousand rills their mazy progress take 

    the laughing flowers  that round them blow 

    drink life and fragrance as they flow 

    now the rich stream of music winds along

    deep  majestic  smooth and strong 

    thro’ verdant vales  and ceres’ golden reign 

    now rolling down the steep amain 

    headlong  impetuous  see it pour 

    the rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar 



      o sovereign of the willing soul 

    parent of sweet and solemn breathing airs 

    enchanting shell  the sullen cares

      and frantic passions hear thy soft controul 

    on thracia’s hills the lord of war

    has curb’d the fury of his car 

    and dropp’d his thirsty lance at thy command 

    perching on the sceptred hand

    of jove  thy magic lulls the feather’d king

    with ruffled plumes and flagging wing 

    quench’d in dark clouds of slumber lie

    the terror of his beak  and lightnings of his eye 



    thee the voice  the dance  obey 

    temper’d to thy warbled lay 

      o’er idalia’s velvet green

      the rosy crownèd loves are seen

    on cytherea’s day

      with antic sports  and blue eyed pleasures 

      frisking light in frolic measures 

    now pursuing  now retreating 

      now in circling troops they meet 

    to brisk notes in cadence beating 

      glance their many twinkling feet 

    slow melting strains their queen’s approach declare 

      where’er she turns the graces homage pay 

    with arms sublime  that float upon the air 

      in gliding state she wins her easy way 

    o’er her warm cheek and rising bosom move

    the bloom of young desire and purple light of love 



      man’s feeble race what ills await 

    labour  and penury  the racks of pain 

      disease  and sorrow’s weeping train 

      and death  sad refuge from the storms of fate 

    the fond complaint  my song  disprove

    and justify the laws of jove 

    say  has he giv’n in vain the heav’nly muse 

    night  and all her sickly dews 

    her spectres wan  and birds of boding cry 

    he gives to range the dreary sky 

    till down the eastern cliffs afar

    hyperion’s march they spy  and glitt’ring shafts of war 



      in climes beyond the solar road 

    where shaggy forms o’er ice built mountains roam 

    the muse has broke the twilight gloom

      to cheer the shiv’ring native’s dull abode 

    and oft  beneath the od’rous shade

    of chili’s boundless forests laid 

    she deigns to hear the savage youth repeat

    in loose numbers wildly sweet

    their feather cinctured chiefs  and dusky loves 

    her track  where’er the goddess roves 

    glory pursue and generous shame 

    th’ unconquerable mind  and freedom’s holy flame 



    woods  that wave o’er delphi’s steep 

    isles  that crown th’ ægean deep 

      fields  that cool ilissus laves 

      or where mæander’s amber waves

    in lingering lab’rinths creep 

      how do your tuneful echoes languish 

      mute  but to the voice of anguish 

    where each old poetic mountain

      inspiration breathed around 

    ev’ry shade and hallow’d fountain

      murmur’d deep a solemn sound 

    till the sad nine  in greece’s evil hour 

      left their parnassus for the latian plains 

    alike they scorn the pomp of tyrant power 

      and coward vice  that revels in her chains 

    when latium had her lofty spirit lost 

    they sought  o albion  next thy sea encircled coast 



      far from the sun and summer gale 

    in thy green lap was nature’s darling laid 

    what time  where lucid avon stray’d 

      to him the mighty mother did unveil

    her awful face  the dauntless child

    stretch’d forth his little arms  and smiled 

    this pencil take  she said   whose colours clear

    richly paint the vernal year 

    thine too these golden keys  immortal boy 

    this can unlock the gates of joy 

    of horror that  and thrilling fears 

    or ope the sacred source of sympathetic tears 



      nor second he  that rode sublime

    upon the seraph wings of ecstasy 

    the secrets of th’ abyss to spy 

      he pass’d the flaming bounds of place and time 

    the living throne  the sapphire blaze 

    where angels tremble while they gaze 

    he saw  but blasted with excess of light 

    closed his eyes in endless night 

    behold  where dryden’s less presumptuous car 

    wide o’er the fields of glory bear

    two coursers of ethereal race 

    with necks in thunder clothed  and long resounding pace 



    hark  his hands the lyre explore 

    bright eyed fancy hovering o’er

      scatters from her pictured urn

      thoughts that breathe  and words that burn 

    but ah  ’tis heard no more    

      o lyre divine  what daring spirit

      wakes thee now  tho’ he inherit

    nor the pride  nor ample pinion 

      that the theban eagle bear

    sailing with supreme dominion

      thro’ the azure deep of air 

    yet oft before his infant eyes would run

      such forms as glitter in the muse’s ray 

    with orient hues  unborrow’d of the sun 

      yet shall he mount  and keep his distant way

    beyond the limits of a vulgar fate 

    beneath the good how far  but far above the great 





 456    on a favourite cat  drowned in a tub of gold fishes 



    twas on a lofty vase’s side 

    where china’s gayest art had dyed

      the azure flowers that blow 

    demurest of the tabby kind 

    the pensive selima reclined 

      gazed on the lake below 



    her conscious tail her joy declared 

    the fair round face  the snowy beard 

      the velvet of her paws 

    her coat  that with the tortoise vies 

    her ears of jet  and emerald eyes 

      she saw  and purr’d applause 



    still had she gazed  but ’midst the tide

    two angel forms were seen to glide 

      the genii of the stream 

    their scaly armour’s tyrian hue

    thro’ richest purple to the view

      betray’d a golden gleam 



    the hapless nymph with wonder saw 

    a whisker first and then a claw 

      with many an ardent wish 

    she stretch’d in vain to reach the prize 

    what female heart can gold despise 

      what cat’s averse to fish 





    presumptuous maid  with looks intent

    again she stretch’d  again she bent 

      nor knew the gulf between 

     malignant fate sat by  and smiled  

    the slipp’ry verge her feet beguiled 

      she tumbled headlong in 



    eight times emerging from the flood

    she mew’d to ev’ry wat’ry god 

      some speedy aid to send 

    no dolphin came  no nereid stirr’d 

    nor cruel  tom   nor  susan  heard 

      a fav’rite has no friend 



    from hence  ye beauties  undeceived 

    know  one false step is ne’er retrieved 

      and be with caution bold 

    not all that tempts your wand’ring eyes

    and heedless hearts  is lawful prize 

      nor all that glisters  gold

 457    ode to simplicity 



        o thou  by nature taught

        to breathe her genuine thought

    in numbers warmly pure and sweetly strong 

        who first on mountains wild 

        in fancy  loveliest child 

    thy babe and pleasure’s  nursed the pow’rs of song 





        thou  who with hermit heart

        disdain’st the wealth of art 

    and gauds  and pageant weeds  and trailing pall 

        but com’st a decent maid 

        in attic robe array’d 

    o chaste  unboastful nymph  to thee i call 



        by all the honey’d store

        on hybla’s thymy shore 

    by all her blooms and mingled murmurs dear 

        by her whose love lorn woe 

        in evening musings slow 

    soothed sweetly sad electra’s poet’s ear 



        by old cephisus deep 

        who spread his wavy sweep

    in warbled wand’rings round thy green retreat 

        on whose enamell’d side 

        when holy freedom died 

    no equal haunt allured thy future feet 



        o sister meek of truth 

        to my admiring youth

    thy sober aid and native charms infuse 

        the flow’rs that sweetest breathe 

        though beauty cull’d the wreath 

    still ask thy hand to range their order’d hues 



        while rome could none esteem 

        but virtue’s patriot theme 

    you loved her hills  and led her laureate band 

        but stay’d to sing alone

        to one distinguish’d throne 

    and turn’d thy face  and fled her alter’d land 





        no more  in hall or bow’r 

        the passions own thy pow’r 

    love  only love her forceless numbers mean 

        for thou hast left her shrine 

        nor olive more  nor vine 

    shall gain thy feet to bless the servile scene 



        though taste  though genius bless

        to some divine excess 

    faint’s the cold work till thou inspire the whole 

        what each  what all supply 

        may court  may charm our eye 

    thou  only thou  canst raise the meeting soul 



        of these let others ask 

        to aid some mighty task 

    i only seek to find thy temperate vale 

        where oft my reed might sound

        to maids and shepherds round 

    and all thy sons  o nature  learn my tale 





 458    how sleep the brave 



    how sleep the brave  who sink to rest

    by all their country’s wishes blest 

    when spring  with dewy fingers cold 

    returns to deck their hallow’d mould 

    she there shall dress a sweeter sod

    than fancy’s feet have ever trod 



    by fairy hands their knell is rung 

    by forms unseen their dirge is sung 

    there honour comes  a pilgrim grey 

    to bless the turf that wraps their clay 

    and freedom shall awhile repair

    to dwell  a weeping hermit  there 





 459    ode to evening 



    if aught of oaten stop  or pastoral song 

    may hope  chaste eve  to soothe thy modest ear 

      like thy own solemn springs 

      thy springs and dying gales 



    o nymph reserved  while now the bright hair’d sun

    sits in yon western tent  whose cloudy skirts 

      with brede ethereal wove 

      o’erhang his wavy bed 



    now air is hush’d  save where the weak eyed bat

    with short shrill shriek flits by on leathern wing 

      or where the beetle winds

      his small but sullen horn 



    as oft he rises  ’midst the twilight path

    against the pilgrim borne in heedless hum 

      now teach me  maid composed 

      to breathe some soften’d strain 



    whose numbers  stealing through thy darkening vale 

    may not unseemly with its stillness suit 

      as  musing slow  i hail

      thy genial loved return 



    for when thy folding star arising shows

    his paly circlet  at his warning lamp

      the fragrant hours  and elves

      who slept in buds the day 

    and many a nymph who wreathes her brows with sedge 

    and sheds the freshening dew  and  lovelier still 

        the pensive pleasures sweet 

        prepare thy shadowy car 



    then lead  calm votaress  where some sheety lake

    cheers the lone heath  or some time hallow’d pile 

        or upland fallows grey

        reflect its last cool gleam 



    or if chill blustering winds  or driving rain 

    prevent my willing feet  be mine the hut

        that from the mountain’s side

        views wilds and swelling floods 



    and hamlets brown  and dim discover’d spires 

    and hears their simple bell  and marks o’er all

        thy dewy fingers draw

        the gradual dusky veil 



    while spring shall pour his show’rs  as oft he wont 

    and bathe thy breathing tresses  meekest eve 

        while summer loves to sport

        beneath thy lingering light 



    while sallow autumn fills thy lap with leaves 

    or winter  yelling through the troublous air 

        affrights thy shrinking train 

        and rudely rends thy robes 



    so long  regardful of thy quiet rule 

    shall fancy  friendship  science  rose lipp’d health

        thy gentlest influence own 

        and hymn thy favourite name 





 460    fidele 



    to fair fidele’s grassy tomb

      soft maids and village hinds shall bring

    each opening sweet of earliest bloom 

      and rifle all the breathing spring 



    no wailing ghost shall dare appear

      to vex with shrieks this quiet grove 

    but shepherd lads assemble here 

      and melting virgins own their love 



    no wither’d witch shall here be seen 

      no goblins lead their nightly crew 

    the female fays shall haunt the green 

      and dress thy grave with pearly dew 



    the redbreast oft at evening hours

      shall kindly lend his little aid 

    with hoary moss  and gather’d flowers 

      to deck the ground where thou art laid 



    when howling winds  and beating rain 

      in tempests shake thy sylvan cell 

    or ’midst the chase  on every plain 

      the tender thought on thee shall dwell 



    each lonely scene shall thee restore 

      for thee the tear be duly shed 

    beloved  till life can charm no more 

      and mourn’d  till pity’s self be dead

 461    amoret 



    if rightly tuneful bards decide 

      if it be fix’d in love’s decrees 

    that beauty ought not to be tried

      but by its native power to please 

    then tell me  youths and lovers  tell  

    what fair can amoret excel 



    behold that bright unsullied smile 

      and wisdom speaking in her mien 

    yet  she so artless all the while 

      so little studious to be seen  

    we naught but instant gladness know 

    nor think to whom the gift we owe 



    but neither music  nor the powers

      of youth and mirth and frolic cheer 

    add half the sunshine to the hours 

      or make life’s prospect half so clear 

    as memory brings it to the eye

    from scenes where amoret was by 



    this  sure  is beauty’s happiest part 

      this gives the most unbounded sway 

    this shall enchant the subject heart

      when rose and lily fade away 

    and she be still  in spite of time 

    sweet amoret in all her prime 





 462    the complaint 



          away  away 

      tempt me no more  insidious love 

          thy soothing sway

      long did my youthful bosom prove 

      at length thy treason is discerned 

      at length some dear bought caution earn’d 

    away  nor hope my riper age to move 



          i know  i see

      her merit  needs it now be shown 

          alas  to me 

      how often  to myself unknown 

      the graceful  gentle  virtuous maid

      have i admired  how often said  

    what joy to call a heart like hers one’s own 



          but  flattering god 

      o squanderer of content and ease

          in thy abode

      will care’s rude lesson learn to please 

      o say  deceiver  hast thou won

      proud fortune to attend thy throne 

    or placed thy friends above her stern decrees 





 463    the nightingale 



    to night retired  the queen of heaven

      with young endymion stays 

    and now to hesper it is given

    awhile to rule the vacant sky 

    till she shall to her lamp supply

      a stream of brighter rays 





    propitious send thy golden ray 

      thou purest light above 

    let no false flame seduce to stray

    where gulf or steep lie hid for harm 

    but lead where music’s healing charm

      may soothe afflicted love 



    to them  by many a grateful song

      in happier seasons vow’d 

    these lawns  olympia’s haunts  belong 

    oft by yon silver stream we walk’d 

    or fix’d  while philomela talk’d 

      beneath yon copses stood 



    nor seldom  where the beechen boughs

      that roofless tower invade 

    we came  while her enchanting muse

    the radiant moon above us held 

    till  by a clamorous owl compell’d 

      she fled the solemn shade 



    but hark  i hear her liquid tone 

      now hesper guide my feet 

    down the red marl with moss o’ergrown 

    through yon wild thicket next the plain 

    whose hawthorns choke the winding lane

      which leads to her retreat 



    see the green space  on either hand

      enlarged it spreads around 

    see  in the midst she takes her stand 

    where one old oak his awful shade

    extends o’er half the level mead 

      enclosed in woods profound 





    hark  how through many a melting note

      she now prolongs her lays 

    how sweetly down the void they float 

    the breeze their magic path attends 

    the stars shine out  the forest bends 

      the wakeful heifers graze 



    whoe’er thou art whom chance may bring

      to this sequester’d spot 

    if then the plaintive siren sing 

    o softly tread beneath her bower

    and think of heaven’s disposing power 

      of man’s uncertain lot 



    o think  o’er all this mortal stage

      what mournful scenes arise 

    what ruin waits on kingly rage 

    how often virtue dwells with woe 

    how many griefs from knowledge flow 

      how swiftly pleasure flies 



    o sacred bird  let me at eve 

      thus wandering all alone 

    thy tender counsel oft receive 

    bear witness to thy pensive airs 

    and pity nature’s common cares 

      till i forget my own

 464    to leven water 



    pure stream  in whose transparent wave

    my youthful limbs i wont to lave 

    no torrents stain thy limpid source 

    no rocks impede thy dimpling course

    devolving from thy parent lake

    a charming maze thy waters make

    by bowers of birch and groves of pine

    and edges flower’d with eglantine 



    still on thy banks so gaily green

    may numerous herds and flocks be seen 

    and lasses chanting o’er the pail 

    and shepherds piping in the dale 

    and ancient faith that knows no guile 

    and industry embrown’d with toil 

    and hearts resolved and hands prepared

    the blessings they enjoy to guard

 465    song to david 



    sublime  invention ever young 

    of vast conception  tow’ring tongue

        to god th’ eternal theme 

    notes from yon exaltations caught 

    unrivall’d royalty of thought

        o’er meaner strains supreme 





    his muse  bright angel of his verse 

    gives balm for all the thorns that pierce 

        for all the pangs that rage 

    blest light still gaining on the gloom 

    the more than michal of his bloom 

        th’ abishag of his age 



    he sang of god  the mighty source

    of all things  the stupendous force

        on which all strength depends 

    from whose right arm  beneath whose eyes 

    all period  power  and enterprise

        commences  reigns  and ends 



    tell them  i am  jehovah said

    to moses  while earth heard in dread 

        and  smitten to the heart 

    at once above  beneath  around 

    all nature  without voice or sound 

        replied  o lord  thou art 



    the world  the clustering spheres  he made 

    the glorious light  the soothing shade 

        dale  champaign  grove  and hill 

    the multitudinous abyss 

    where secrecy remains in bliss 

        and wisdom hides her skill 



    the pillars of the lord are seven 

    which stand from earth to topmost heaven 

        his wisdom drew the plan 

    his word accomplished the design 

    from brightest gem to deepest mine 

        from christ enthroned  to man 





    for adoration all the ranks

    of angels yield eternal thanks 

        and david in the midst 

    with god’s good poor  which  last and least

    in man’s esteem  thou to thy feast 

        o blessèd bridegroom  bidd’st 



    for adoration  david’s psalms

    lift up the heart to deeds of alms 

        and he  who kneels and chants 

    prevails his passions to control 

    finds meat and medicine to the soul 

        which for translation pants 



    for adoration  in the dome

    of christ  the sparrows find a home 

        and on his olives perch 

    the swallow also dwells with thee 

    o man of god’s humility 

        within his saviour’s church 



    sweet is the dew that falls betimes 

    and drops upon the leafy limes 

        sweet  hermon’s fragrant air 

    sweet is the lily’s silver bell 

    and sweet the wakeful tapers’ smell

        that watch for early prayer 



    sweet the young nurse  with love intense 

    which smiles o’er sleeping innocence 

        sweet  when the lost arrive 

    sweet the musician’s ardour beats 

    while his vague mind’s in quest of sweets 

        the choicest flowers to hive 





    strong is the horse upon his speed 

    strong in pursuit the rapid glede 

        which makes at once his game 

    strong the tall ostrich on the ground 

    strong through the turbulent profound

        shoots xiphias to his aim 



    strong is the lion  like a coal

    his eyeball   like a bastion’s mole

        his chest against the foes 

    strong the gier eagle on his sail 

    strong against tide th’ enormous whale

        emerges as he goes 



    but stronger still  in earth and air 

    and in the sea  the man of prayer 

        and far beneath the tide 

    and in the seat to faith assigned 

    where ask is have  where seek is find 

        where knock is open wide 



    precious the penitential tear 

    and precious is the sigh sincere 

        acceptable to god 

    and precious are the winning flowers 

    in gladsome israel’s feast of bowers

        bound on the hallow’d sod 



    glorious the sun in mid career 

    glorious th’ assembled fires appear 

        glorious the comet’s train 

    glorious the trumpet and alarm 

    glorious the almighty’s stretch’d out arm 

        glorious th’ enraptured main 



     glede  kite  xiphias  sword fish 



    glorious the northern lights astream 

    glorious the song  when god’s the theme 

        glorious the thunder’s roar 

    glorious hosanna from the den 

    glorious the catholic amen 

        glorious the martyr’s gore 



    glorious  more glorious  is the crown

    of him that brought salvation down 

        by meekness call’d thy son 

    thou that stupendous truth believed   

    and now the matchless deed’s achieved 

        determined  dared  and done

    when lovely woman stoops to folly 

      and finds too late that men betray 

    what charm can soothe her melancholy 

      what art can wash her tears away 



    the only art her guilt to cover 

      to hide her shame from ev’ry eye 

    to give repentance to her lover 

      and wring his bosom is  to die

    o memory  thou fond deceiver 

      still importunate and vain 

    to former joys recurring ever 

      and turning all the past to pain 



    thou  like the world  th’ oppress’d oppressing 

      thy smiles increase the wretch’s woe 

    and he who wants each other blessing

      in thee must ever find a foe

 470    to mary unwin 



    mary  i want a lyre with other strings 

    such aid from heaven as some have feign’d they drew 

    an eloquence scarce given to mortals  new

    and undebased by praise of meaner things 

    that ere through age or woe i shed my wings 

    i may record thy worth with honour due 

    in verse as musical as thou art true 

    and that immortalizes whom it sings 

    but thou hast little need  there is a book

    by seraphs writ with beams of heavenly light 

    on which the eyes of god not rarely look 

    a chronicle of actions just and bright  

      there all thy deeds  my faithful mary  shine 

      and since thou own’st that praise  i spare thee mine 





 471    my mary 



    the twentieth year is wellnigh past

    since first our sky was overcast 

    ah  would that this might be the last 

                                my mary 



    thy spirits have a fainter flow 

    i see thee daily weaker grow 

    ’twas my distress that brought thee low 

                                my mary 



    thy needles  once a shining store 

    for my sake restless heretofore 

    now rust disused  and shine no more 

                                my mary 



    for though thou gladly wouldst fulfil

    the same kind office for me still 

    thy sight now seconds not thy will 

                                my mary 



    but well thou play’dst the housewife’s part 

    and all thy threads with magic art

    have wound themselves about this heart 

                                my mary 



    thy indistinct expressions seem

    like language utter’d in a dream 

    yet me they charm  whate’er the theme 

                                my mary 





    thy silver locks  once auburn bright 

    are still more lovely in my sight

    than golden beams of orient light 

                                my mary 



    for could i view nor them nor thee 

    what sight worth seeing could i see 

    the sun would rise in vain for me 

                                my mary 



    partakers of thy sad decline 

    thy hands their little force resign 

    yet  gently press’d  press gently mine 

                                my mary 



    such feebleness of limbs thou prov’st 

    that now at every step thou mov’st

    upheld by two  yet still thou lov’st 

                                my mary 



    and still to love  though press’d with ill 

    in wintry age to feel no chill 

    with me is to be lovely still 

                                my mary 



    but ah  by constant heed i know

    how oft the sadness that i show

    transforms thy smiles to looks of woe 

                                my mary 



    and should my future lot be cast

    with much resemblance of the past 

    thy worn out heart will break at last  

                                my mary

    through blank oblivious years th’ appointed hour

    through pleasant and through cloudy weather

        then steal away  give little warning

 475    prayer for indifference 



    i ask no kind return of love 

      no tempting charm to please 

    far from the heart those gifts remove 

      that sighs for peace and ease 



    nor peace nor ease the heart can know 

      that  like the needle true 

    turns at the touch of joy or woe 

      but  turning  trembles too 



    far as distress the soul can wound 

      ’tis pain in each degree 

    ’tis bliss but to a certain bound 

      beyond is agony

    hail  beauteous stranger of the grove 

      thou messenger of spring 

    now heaven repairs thy rural seat 

      and woods thy welcome ring 



    what time the daisy decks the green 

      thy certain voice we hear 

    hast thou a star to guide thy path 

      or mark the rolling year 



    delightful visitant  with thee

      i hail the time of flowers 

    and hear the sound of music sweet

      from birds among the bowers 



    the schoolboy  wand’ring through the wood

      to pull the primrose gay 

    starts  the new voice of spring to hear 

      and imitates thy lay 



    what time the pea puts on the bloom 

      thou fli’st thy vocal vale 

    an annual guest in other lands 

      another spring to hail 



    sweet bird  thy bower is ever green 

      thy sky is ever clear 

    thou hast no sorrow in thy song 

      no winter in thy year 



    o could i fly  i’d fly with thee 

      we’d make  with joyful wing 

    our annual visit o’er the globe 

      companions of the spring

    while my gudeman lies sound by me 



    young jamie lo’ed me weel  and sought me for his bride 

    but saving a croun he had naething else beside 

    to make the croun a pund  young jamie gaed to sea 

    and the croun and the pund were baith for me 



    he hadna been awa’ a week but only twa

    his ship it was a wrack  why didna jamie dee 

    or why do i live to cry  wae’s me 



    my father urged me sair  my mother didna speak

    they gi’ed him my hand  tho’ my heart was in the sea 

    sae auld robin gray he was gudeman to me 



    i hadna been a wife a week but only four 

    when mournfu’ as i sat on the stane at the door 

    i saw my jamie’s wraith   for i couldna think it he 

    till he said  ‘i’m come hame to marry thee ’



    o sair  sair did we greet  and muckle did we say 

    we took but ae kiss  and we tore ourselves away 

    i wish that i were dead  but i’m no like to dee 

    and why was i born to say  wae’s me 



    i gang like a ghaist  and i carena to spin 

    i daurna think on jamie  for that wad be a sin 

    but i’ll do my best a gude wife aye to be 

    for auld robin gray he is kind unto me

 478    epigram 



    on parent knees  a naked new born child 

    weeping thou sat’st while all around thee smiled 

    so live  that sinking to thy life’s last sleep 

    calm thou may’st smile  whilst all around thee weep

 479    song from ælla 



    o sing unto my roundelay 

    o drop the briny tear with me 

    dance no more at holyday 

    like a running river be 

        my love is dead 

        gone to his death bed

    all under the willow tree 



    black his cryne as the winter night 

    white his rode as the summer snow 

    red his face as the morning light 

    cold he lies in the grave below 

        my love is dead 

        gone to his death bed

    all under the willow tree 



    sweet his tongue as the throstle’s note 

    quick in dance as thought can be 

    deft his tabor  cudgel stout 

    o he lies by the willow tree 

        my love is dead 

        gone to his death bed

    all under the willow tree 



      479   cryne  hair  rode  complexion 





    hark  the raven flaps his wing

    in the brier’d dell below 

    hark  the death owl loud doth sing

    to the nightmares  as they go 

      my love is dead 

      gone to his death bed

    all under the willow tree 



    see  the white moon shines on high 

    whiter is my true love’s shroud 

    whiter than the morning sky 

    whiter than the evening cloud 

      my love is dead 

      gone to his death bed

    all under the willow tree 



    here upon my true love’s grave

    shall the barren flowers be laid 

    not one holy saint to save

    all the coldness of a maid 

      my love is dead 

      gone to his death bed

    all under the willow tree 



    with my hands i’ll dent the briers

    round his holy corse to gre 

    ouph and fairy  light your fires 

    here my body still shall be 

      my love is dead 

      gone to his death bed

    all under the willow tree 



     dent  fasten  gre  grow  ouph  elf 



    come  with acorn cup and thorn 

    drain my heartès blood away 

    life and all its good i scorn 

    dance by night  or feast by day 

        my love is dead 

        gone to his death bed

    all under the willow tree

 480    meeting 



    my damon was the first to wake

      the gentle flame that cannot die 

    my damon is the last to take

      the faithful bosom’s softest sigh 

    the life between is nothing worth 

      o cast it from thy thought away 

    think of the day that gave it birth 

      and this its sweet returning day 



    buried be all that has been done 

      or say that naught is done amiss 

    for who the dangerous path can shun

      in such bewildering world as this 

    but love can every fault forgive 

      or with a tender look reprove 

    and now let naught in memory live

      but that we meet  and that we love 





 481    late wisdom 



    we’ve trod the maze of error round 

      long wandering in the winding glade 

    and now the torch of truth is found 

      it only shows us where we strayed 

    by long experience taught  we know  

      can rightly judge of friends and foes 

    can all the worth of these allow 

      and all the faults discern in those 



    now  ’tis our boast that we can quell

      the wildest passions in their rage 

    can their destructive force repel 

      and their impetuous wrath assuage   

    ah  virtue  dost thou arm when now

      this bold rebellious race are fled 

    when all these tyrants rest  and thou

      art warring with the mighty dead 





 482    a marriage ring 



    the ring  so worn as you behold 

    so thin  so pale  is yet of gold 

    the passion such it was to prove  

    worn with life’s care  love yet was love

 483    to the muses 



    whether on ida’s shady brow

      or in the chambers of the east 

    the chambers of the sun  that now

      from ancient melody have ceased 



    whether in heaven ye wander fair 

      or the green corners of the earth 

    or the blue regions of the air

      where the melodious winds have birth 



    whether on crystal rocks ye rove 

      beneath the bosom of the sea 

    wandering in many a coral grove 

      fair nine  forsaking poetry 



    how have you left the ancient love

      that bards of old enjoy’d in you 

    the languid strings do scarcely move 

      the sound is forced  the notes are few 





 484    to spring 



    o thou with dewy locks  who lookest down

    through the clear windows of the morning  turn

    thine angel eyes upon our western isle 

    which in full choir hails thy approach  o spring 



    the hills tell one another  and the listening

    valleys hear  all our longing eyes are turn’d

    up to thy bright pavilions  issue forth

    and let thy holy feet visit our clime 





    come o’er the eastern hills  and let our winds

    kiss thy perfumèd garments  let us taste

    thy morn and evening breath  scatter thy pearls

    upon our lovesick land that mourns for thee 



    o deck her forth with thy fair fingers  pour

    thy soft kisses on her bosom  and put

    thy golden crown upon her languish’d head 

    whose modest tresses are bound up for thee 





 485    song 



    my silks and fine array 

      my smiles and languish’d air 

    by love are driven away 

      and mournful lean despair

    brings me yew to deck my grave 

    such end true lovers have 



    his face is fair as heaven

      when springing buds unfold 

    o why to him was’t given 

      whose heart is wintry cold 

    his breast is love’s all worshipp’d tomb 

    where all love’s pilgrims come 



    bring me an axe and spade 

      bring me a winding sheet 

    when i my grave have made 

      let winds and tempests beat 

    then down i’ll lie  as cold as clay 

    true love doth pass away 





 486    reeds of innocence 



    piping down the valleys wild 

      piping songs of pleasant glee 

    on a cloud i saw a child 

      and he laughing said to me 



    ‘pipe a song about a lamb ’

      so i piped with merry cheer 

    ‘piper  pipe that song again ’

      so i piped  he wept to hear 



    ‘drop thy pipe  thy happy pipe 

      sing thy songs of happy cheer ’

    so i sung the same again 

      while he wept with joy to hear 



    ‘piper  sit thee down and write

      in a book that all may read ’

    so he vanish’d from my sight 

      and i pluck’d a hollow reed 



    and i made a rural pen 

      and i stain’d the water clear 

    and i wrote my happy songs

      every child may joy to hear 





 487    the little black boy 



    my mother bore me in the southern wild 

      and i am black  but o  my soul is white 

    white as an angel is the english child 

      but i am black  as if bereaved of light 





    my mother taught me underneath a tree 

      and  sitting down before the heat of day 

    she took me on her lap and kissèd me 

      and  pointing to the east  began to say 



    ‘look at the rising sun  there god does live 

      and gives his light  and gives his heat away 

    and flowers and trees and beasts and men receive

      comfort in morning  joy in the noonday 



    ‘and we are put on earth a little space 

      that we may learn to bear the beams of love 

    and these black bodies and this sunburnt face

      are but a cloud  and like a shady grove 



    ‘for when our souls have learn’d the heat to bear 

      the cloud will vanish  we shall hear his voice 

    saying  “come out from the grove  my love and care 

      and round my golden tent like lambs rejoice ”’



    thus did my mother say  and kissèd me 

      and thus i say to little english boy 

    when i from black and he from white cloud free 

      and round the tent of god like lambs we joy 



    i’ll shade him from the heat till he can bear

      to lean in joy upon our father’s knee 

    and then i’ll stand and stroke his silver hair 

      and be like him  and he will then love me 





 488    hear the voice 



    hear the voice of the bard 

    who present  past  and future  sees 

    whose ears have heard

    the holy word

    that walk’d among the ancient trees 



    calling the lapsèd soul 

    and weeping in the evening dew 

    that might control

    the starry pole 

    and fallen  fallen light renew 



    ‘o earth  o earth  return 

    arise from out the dewy grass 

    night is worn 

    and the morn

    rises from the slumbrous mass 



    ‘turn away no more 

    why wilt thou turn away 

    the starry floor 

    the watery shore 

    is given thee till the break of day ’





 489    the tiger 



    tiger  tiger  burning bright

    in the forests of the night 

    what immortal hand or eye

    could frame thy fearful symmetry 





    in what distant deeps or skies

    burnt the fire of thine eyes 

    on what wings dare he aspire 

    what the hand dare seize the fire 



    and what shoulder and what art

    could twist the sinews of thy heart 

    and  when thy heart began to beat 

    what dread hand and what dread feet 



    what the hammer  what the chain 

    in what furnace was thy brain 

    what the anvil  what dread grasp

    dare its deadly terrors clasp 



    when the stars threw down their spears 

    and watered heaven with their tears 

    did he smile his work to see 

    did he who made the lamb make thee 



    tiger  tiger  burning bright

    in the forests of the night 

    what immortal hand or eye

    dare frame thy fearful symmetry 





 490    cradle song

    dreaming in the joys of night 

    sleep  sleep  in thy sleep

    little sorrows sit and weep 



    sweet babe  in thy face

    soft desires i can trace 

    secret joys and secret smiles 

    little pretty infant wiles 



    as thy softest limbs i feel

    smiles as of the morning steal

    o’er thy cheek  and o’er thy breast

    where thy little heart doth rest 



    o the cunning wiles that creep

    in thy little heart asleep 

    when thy little heart doth wake 

    then the dreadful night shall break 





 491    night 



    the sun descending in the west 

      the evening star does shine 

    the birds are silent in their nest 

      and i must seek for mine 

        the moon  like a flower

        in heaven’s high bower 

        with silent delight

        sits and smiles on the night 



    farewell  green fields and happy grove 

      where flocks have took delight 

    where lambs have nibbled  silent move

      the feet of angels bright 

        unseen they pour blessing

        and joy without ceasing

        on each bud and blossom 

        on each sleeping bosom 



    they look in every thoughtless nest

      where birds are cover’d warm 

    they visit caves of every beast 

      to keep them all from harm 

        if they see any weeping

        that should have been sleeping 

        they pour sleep on their head 

        and sit down by their bed 



    when wolves and tigers howl for prey 

      they pitying stand and weep 

    seeking to drive their thirst away

      and keep them from the sheep 

        but  if they rush dreadful 

        the angels  most heedful 

        receive each mild spirit 

        new worlds to inherit 



    and there the lion’s ruddy eyes

      shall flow with tears of gold 

    and pitying the tender cries 

      and walking round the fold 

        saying  ‘wrath by his meekness 

        and  by his health  sickness 

        are driven away

        from our immortal day 



    ‘and now beside thee  bleating lamb 

      i can lie down and sleep 

    or think on him who bore thy name 

      graze after thee  and weep 

        for  wash’d in life’s river 

        my bright mane for ever

        shall shine like the gold

        as i guard o’er the fold ’





 492    love’s secret 



    never seek to tell thy love 

      love that never told can be 

    for the gentle wind doth move

      silently  invisibly 



    i told my love  i told my love 

      i told her all my heart 

    trembling  cold  in ghastly fears 

      ah  she did depart 



    soon after she was gone from me 

      a traveller came by 

    silently  invisibly 

      he took her with a sigh

      the castle o’ montgomery 

    green be your woods  and fair your flowers 

      your waters never drumlie 

    there simmer first unfauld her robes 

      and there the langest tarry 

    for there i took the last fareweel

      o’ my sweet highland mary 



    how sweetly bloom’d the gay green birk 

      how rich the hawthorn’s blossom 

    as underneath their fragrant shade

      i clasp’d her to my bosom 

    the golden hours on angel wings

      flew o’er me and my dearie 

    for dear to me as light and life

      was my sweet highland mary 



    wi’ monie a vow and lock’d embrace

      our parting was fu’ tender 

    and  pledging aft to meet again 

      we tore oursels asunder 

    but oh  fell death’s untimely frost 

      that nipt my flower sae early 

    now green’s the sod  and cauld’s the clay 

      that wraps my highland mary 



    o pale  pale now  those rosy lips

      i aft hae kiss’d sae fondly 

    and closed for aye the sparkling glance

      that dwelt on me sae kindly 



     drumlie  miry 



    and mouldering now in silent dust

      that heart that lo’ed me dearly 

    but still within my bosom’s core

      shall live my highland mary 





 502    o were my love yon lilac fair 



    o were my love yon lilac fair 

      wi’ purple blossoms to the spring 

    and i a bird to shelter there 

      when wearied on my little wing 

    how i wad mourn when it was torn

      by autumn wild and winter rude 

    but i wad sing on wanton wing

      when youthfu’ may its bloom renew’d 



    o gin my love were yon red rose

      that grows upon the castle wa’ 

    and i mysel a drap o’ dew 

      into her bonnie breast to fa’ 

    o there  beyond expression blest 

      i’d feast on beauty a’ the night 

    seal’d on her silk saft faulds to rest 

      till fley’d awa’ by phœbus’ light 





 503    a red  red rose 



    o my luve’s like a red  red rose

    that’s newly sprung in june 

    o my luve’s like the melodie

    that’s sweetly play’d in tune 



    as fair art thou  my bonnie lass 

    so deep in luve am i 

    and i will luve thee still  my dear 

    till a’ the seas gang dry 



    till a’ the seas gang dry  my dear 

    and the rocks melt wi’ the sun 

    i will luve thee still  my dear 

    while the sands o’ life shall run 



    and fare thee weel  my only luve 

    and fare thee weel a while 

    and i will come again  my luve 

    tho’ it were ten thousand mile 





 504    lament for culloden 



    the lovely lass o’ inverness 

      nae joy nor pleasure can she see 

    for e’en and morn she cries  ‘alas ’

      and aye the saut tear blin’s her e’e 

    ‘drumossie moor  drumossie day 

      a waefu’ day it was to me 

    for there i lost my father dear 

      my father dear and brethren three 



    ‘their winding sheet the bluidy clay 

      their graves are growing green to see 

    and by them lies the dearest lad

      that ever blest a woman’s e’e 

    now wae to thee  thou cruel lord 

      a bluidy man i trow thou be 

    for monie a heart thou hast made sair 

      that ne’er did wrang to thine or thee ’





 505    the farewell 



    it was a’ for our rightfu’ king

      we left fair scotland’s strand 

    it was a’ for our rightfu’ king

      we e’er saw irish land 

                my dear  

      we e’er saw irish land 



    now a’ is done that men can do 

      and a’ is done in vain 

    my love and native land  farewell 

      for i maun cross the main 

                my dear  

      for i maun cross the main 



    he turn’d him right and round about

      upon the irish shore 

    and gae his bridle reins a shake 

      with  adieu for evermore 

                my dear  

      with  adieu for evermore 



    the sodger frae the wars returns 

      the sailor frae the main 

    but i hae parted frae my love 

      never to meet again 

                my dear  

      never to meet again 



    when day is gane  and night is come 

      and a’ folk bound to sleep 

    i think on him that’s far awa’ 

      the lee lang night  and weep 

                my dear  

      the lee lang night  and weep 



     lee lang  livelong 





 506    hark  the mavis 



       ca’ the yowes to the knowes  

         ca’ them where the heather grows  

       ca’ them where the burnie rows  

         my bonnie dearie  



    hark  the mavis’ evening sang

    sounding clouden’s woods amang 

    then a faulding let us gang 

        my bonnie dearie 



    we’ll gae down by clouden side 

    through the hazels spreading wide 

    o’er the waves that sweetly glide

        to the moon sae clearly 



    yonder clouden’s silent towers 

    where at moonshine midnight hours

    o’er the dewy bending flowers

        fairies dance sae cheery 



    ghaist nor bogle shalt thou fear 

    thou’rt to love and heaven sae dear 

    nocht of ill may come thee near 

        my bonnie dearie 



    fair and lovely as thou art 

    thou hast stown my very heart 

    i can die  but canna part 

        my bonnie dearie 



    while waters wimple to the sea 

    while day blinks in the lift sae hie 

    till clay cauld death shall blin’ my e’e 

        ye shall be my dearie 



       ca’ the yowes to the knowes     



     lift  sky

    cherub  call’d by heav’n to shine 

    t’ orient tread the waste forlorn 

    guide ætherial  pow’r divine 

        thou  lord of all within 



    golden spirit  lamp of day 

    host  that dips in blood the plain 

    bids the crimson’d mead be gay 

    bids the green blood burst the vein 

        thou  lord of all within 



    soul  that wraps the globe in light 

    spirit  beckoning to arise 

    drives the frowning brow of night 

    glory bursting o’er the skies 

        thou  lord of all within

    thee too  modest tressèd maid 

      when thy fallen stars appear 

    when in lawn of fire array’d

      sov’reign of yon powder’d sphere 

    to thee i chant at close of day 

    beneath  o maiden moon  thy ray 



    throned in sapphired ring supreme 

      pregnant with celestial juice 

    on silver wing thy diamond stream

      gives what summer hours produce 

    while view’d impearl’d earth’s rich inlay 

    beneath  o maiden moon  thy ray 





    glad  pale cynthian wine i sip 

      breathed the flow’ry leaves among 

    draughts delicious wet my lip 

      drown’d in nectar drunk my song 

    while tuned to philomel the lay 

    beneath  o maiden moon  thy ray 



    dew  that od’rous ointment yields 

      sweets  that western winds disclose 

    bathing spring’s more purpled fields 

      soft’s the band that winds the rose 

    while o’er thy myrtled lawns i stray

    beneath  o maiden moon  thy ray

 509    time and grief 



    o time  who know’st a lenient hand to lay

    softest on sorrow’s wound  and slowly thence

     lulling to sad repose the weary sense 

    the faint pang stealest unperceived away 

    on thee i rest my only hope at last 

    and think  when thou hast dried the bitter tear

    that flows in vain o’er all my soul held dear 

    i may look back on every sorrow past 

    and meet life’s peaceful evening with a smile 

    as some lone bird  at day’s departing hour 

    sings in the sunbeam  of the transient shower

    forgetful  though its wings are wet the while   

      yet ah  how much must this poor heart endure 

      which hopes from thee  and thee alone  a cure

 510    the outlaw’s song 



    the chough and crow to roost are gone 

      the owl sits on the tree 

    the hush’d wind wails with feeble moan 

      like infant charity 

    the wild fire dances on the fen 

      the red star sheds its ray 

    uprouse ye then  my merry men 

      it is our op’ning day 



    both child and nurse are fast asleep 

      and closed is every flower 

    and winking tapers faintly peep

      high from my lady’s bower 

    bewilder’d hinds with shorten’d ken

      shrink on their murky way 

    uprouse ye then  my merry men 

      it is our op’ning day 



    nor board nor garner own we now 

      nor roof nor latchèd door 

    nor kind mate  bound by holy vow

      to bless a good man’s store 

    noon lulls us in a gloomy den 

      and night is grown our day 

    uprouse ye then  my merry men 

      and use it as ye may

      its pretty tricks we try

    for that or for a longer space  

      then tire  and lay it by 



    but i knew one that to itself

      all seasons could control 

    that would have mock’d the sense of pain

      out of a grievèd soul 



    thou straggler into loving arms 

      young climber up of knees 

    when i forget thy thousand ways

      then life and all shall cease

 513    a boy’s song 



    where the pools are bright and deep 

    where the grey trout lies asleep 

    up the river and over the lea 

    that’s the way for billy and me 



    where the blackbird sings the latest 

    where the hawthorn blooms the sweetest 

    where the nestlings chirp and flee 

    that’s the way for billy and me 





    where the mowers mow the cleanest 

    where the hay lies thick and greenest 

    there to track the homeward bee 

    that’s the way for billy and me 



    where the hazel bank is steepest 

    where the shadow falls the deepest 

    where the clustering nuts fall free 

    that’s the way for billy and me 



    why the boys should drive away

    little sweet maidens from the play 

    or love to banter and fight so well 

    that’s the thing i never could tell 



    but this i know  i love to play

    through the meadow  among the hay 

    up the water and over the lea 

    that’s the way for billy and me 





 514    kilmeny 



    bonnie kilmeny gaed up the glen 

    but it wasna to meet duneira’s men 

    nor the rosy monk of the isle to see 

    for kilmeny was pure as pure could be 

    it was only to hear the yorlin sing 

    and pu’ the cress flower round the spring 

    the scarlet hypp and the hindberrye 

    and the nut that hung frae the hazel tree 

    for kilmeny was pure as pure could be 

    but lang may her minny look o’er the wa’ 

    and lang may she seek i’ the green wood shaw 

    lang the laird o’ duneira blame 

    and lang  lang greet or kilmeny come hame 



      514   yorlin  the yellow hammer  hindberrye  bramble  minny 

     mother  greet  mourn 



    when many a day had come and fled 

    when grief grew calm  and hope was dead 

    when mess for kilmeny’s soul had been sung 

    when the bedesman had pray’d and the dead bell rung 

    late  late in gloamin’ when all was still 

    when the fringe was red on the westlin hill 

    the wood was sere  the moon i’ the wane 

    the reek o’ the cot hung over the plain 

    like a little wee cloud in the world its lane 

    when the ingle low’d wi’ an eiry leme 

    late  late in the gloamin’ kilmeny came hame 



    ‘kilmeny  kilmeny  where have you been 

    lang hae we sought baith holt and den 

    by linn  by ford  and green wood tree 

    yet you are halesome and fair to see 

    where gat you that joup o’ the lily scheen 

    that bonnie snood of the birk sae green 

    and these roses  the fairest that ever were seen 

    kilmeny  kilmeny  where have you been ’



    kilmeny look’d up with a lovely grace 

    but nae smile was seen on kilmeny’s face 

    as still was her look  and as still was her e’e 

    as the stillness that lay on the emerant lea 

    or the mist that sleeps on a waveless sea 

    for kilmeny had been  she knew not where 

    and kilmeny had seen what she could not declare 

    kilmeny had been where the cock never crew 

    where the rain never fell  and the wind never blew 

    but it seem’d as the harp of the sky had rung 

    and the airs of heaven play’d round her tongue 



     westlin  western  its lane  alone  by itself  low’d  flamed  eiry

     leme  eery gleam  linn  waterfall  joup  mantle 



    when she spake of the lovely forms she had seen 

    and a land where sin had never been 

    a land of love and a land of light 

    withouten sun  or moon  or night 

    where the river swa’d a living stream 

    and the light a pure celestial beam 

    the land of vision  it would seem 

    a still  an everlasting dream 



      in yon green wood there is a waik 

    and in that waik there is a wene 

      and in that wene there is a maike 

    that neither has flesh  blood  nor bane 

    and down in yon green wood he walks his lane 



    in that green wene kilmeny lay 

    her bosom happ’d wi’ flowerets gay 

    but the air was soft and the silence deep 

    and bonnie kilmeny fell sound asleep 

    she kenn’d nae mair  nor open’d her e’e 

    till waked by the hymns of a far countrye 



    she ‘waken’d on a couch of the silk sae slim 

    all striped wi’ the bars of the rainbow’s rim 

    and lovely beings round were rife 

    who erst had travell’d mortal life 

    and aye they smiled and ’gan to speer 

    ‘what spirit has brought this mortal here ’  



    ‘lang have i journey’d  the world wide ’

    a meek and reverend fere replied 

    ‘baith night and day i have watch’d the fair 

    eident a thousand years and mair 



     swa’d  swelled  waik  a row of deep damp grass  wene   whin  a

     furze bush  maike  a mate  match  equal  his lane  alone  by

     himself  happ’d  covered  speer  inquire  fere  fellow  eident 

     unintermittently 



    yes  i have watch’d o’er ilk degree 

    wherever blooms femenitye 

    but sinless virgin  free of stain

    in mind and body  fand i nane 

    never  since the banquet of time 

    found i a virgin in her prime 

    till late this bonnie maiden i saw

    as spotless as the morning snaw 

    full twenty years she has lived as free

    as the spirits that sojourn in this countrye 

    i have brought her away frae the snares of men 

    that sin or death she never may ken ’  



    they clasp’d her waist and her hands sae fair 

    they kiss’d her cheek and they kemed her hair 

    and round came many a blooming fere 

    saying  ‘bonnie kilmeny  ye’re welcome here 

    women are freed of the littand scorn 

    o blest be the day kilmeny was born 

    now shall the land of the spirits see 

    now shall it ken what a woman may be 

    many a lang year  in sorrow and pain 

    many a lang year through the world we’ve gane 

    commission’d to watch fair womankind 

    for it’s they who nurice the immortal mind 

    we have watch’d their steps as the dawning shone 

    and deep in the green wood walks alone 

    by lily bower and silken bed 

    the viewless tears have o’er them shed 

    have soothed their ardent minds to sleep 

    or left the couch of love to weep 



     kemed  combed 



    we have seen  we have seen  but the time must come 

    and the angels will weep at the day of doom 



    ‘o would the fairest of mortal kind

    aye keep the holy truths in mind 

    that kindred spirits their motions see 

    who watch their ways with anxious e’e 

    and grieve for the guilt of humanitye 

    o  sweet to heaven the maiden’s prayer 

    and the sigh that heaves a bosom sae fair 

    and dear to heaven the words of truth 

    and the praise of virtue frae beauty’s mouth 

    and dear to the viewless forms of air 

    the minds that kyth as the body fair 



    ‘o bonnie kilmeny  free frae stain 

    if ever you seek the world again 

    that world of sin  of sorrow and fear 

    o tell of the joys that are waiting here 

    and tell of the signs you shall shortly see 

    of the times that are now  and the times that shall be ’  

    they lifted kilmeny  they led her away 

    and she walk’d in the light of a sunless day 

    the sky was a dome of crystal bright 

    the fountain of vision  and fountain of light 

    the emerald fields were of dazzling glow 

    and the flowers of everlasting blow 

    then deep in the stream her body they laid 

    that her youth and beauty never might fade 

    and they smiled on heaven  when they saw her lie

    in the stream of life that wander’d bye 

    and she heard a song  she heard it sung 

    she kenn’d not where  but sae sweetly it rung 



     kyth  show  appear 



    it fell on the ear like a dream of the morn 

    ‘o  blest be the day kilmeny was born 

    now shall the land of the spirits see 

    now shall it ken what a woman may be 

    the sun that shines on the world sae bright 

    a borrow’d gleid frae the fountain of light 

    and the moon that sleeks the sky sae dun 

    like a gouden bow  or a beamless sun 

    shall wear away  and be seen nae mair 

    and the angels shall miss them travelling the air 

    but lang  lang after baith night and day 

    when the sun and the world have elyed away 

    when the sinner has gane to his waesome doom 

    kilmeny shall smile in eternal bloom ’  



    they bore her away  she wist not how 

    for she felt not arm nor rest below 

    but so swift they wain’d her through the light 

    ’twas like the motion of sound or sight 

    they seem’d to split the gales of air 

    and yet nor gale nor breeze was there 

    unnumber’d groves below them grew 

    they came  they pass’d  and backward flew 

    like floods of blossoms gliding on 

    in moment seen  in moment gone 

    o  never vales to mortal view

    appear’d like those o’er which they flew 

    that land to human spirits given 

    the lowermost vales of the storied heaven 

    from thence they can view the world below 

    and heaven’s blue gates with sapphires glow 

    more glory yet unmeet to know 



     gleid  spark  glow  elyed  vanished 



    they bore her far to a mountain green 

    to see what mortal never had seen 

    and they seated her high on a purple sward 

    and bade her heed what she saw and heard 

    and note the changes the spirits wrought 

    for now she lived in the land of thought 

    she look’d  and she saw nor sun nor skies 

    but a crystal dome of a thousand dyes 

    she look’d  and she saw nae land aright 

    but an endless whirl of glory and light 

    and radiant beings went and came 

    far swifter than wind  or the linkèd flame 

    she hid her e’en frae the dazzling view 

    she look’d again  and the scene was new 



    she saw a sun on a summer sky 

    and clouds of amber sailing bye 

    a lovely land beneath her lay 

    and that land had glens and mountains gray 

    and that land had valleys and hoary piles 

    and marlèd seas  and a thousand isles 

    its fields were speckled  its forests green

    and its lakes were all of the dazzling sheen 

    like magic mirrors  where slumbering lay

    the sun and the sky and the cloudlet gray 

    which heaved and trembled  and gently swung 

    on every shore they seem’d to be hung 

    for there they were seen on their downward plain

    a thousand times and a thousand again 

    in winding lake and placid firth 

    little peaceful heavens in the bosom of earth 



     marlèd  variegated  parti coloured 



    kilmeny sigh’d and seem’d to grieve 

    for she found her heart to that land did cleave 

    she saw the corn wave on the vale 

    she saw the deer run down the dale 

    she saw the plaid and the broad claymore 

    and the brows that the badge of freedom bore 

    and she thought she had seen the land before 



    she saw a lady sit on a throne 

    the fairest that ever the sun shone on 

    a lion lick’d her hand of milk 

    and she held him in a leish of silk 

    and a leifu’ maiden stood at her knee 

    with a silver wand and melting e’e 

    her sovereign shield till love stole in 

    and poison’d all the fount within 



    then a gruff untoward bedesman came 

    and hundit the lion on his dame 

    and the guardian maid wi’ the dauntless e’e 

    she dropp’d a tear  and left her knee 

    and she saw till the queen frae the lion fled 

    till the bonniest flower of the world lay dead 

    a coffin was set on a distant plain 

    and she saw the red blood fall like rain 

    then bonnie kilmeny’s heart grew sair 

    and she turn’d away  and could look nae mair 



    then the gruff grim carle girn’d amain 

    and they trampled him down  but he rose again 

    and he baited the lion to deeds of weir 

    till he lapp’d the blood to the kingdom dear 



     leifu’  lone  wistful  girn’d  snarled  weir  war 



    and weening his head was danger preef 

    when crown’d with the rose and clover leaf 

    he gowl’d at the carle  and chased him away

    to feed wi’ the deer on the mountain gray 

    he gowl’d at the carle  and geck’d at heaven 

    but his mark was set  and his arles given 

    kilmeny a while her e’en withdrew 

    she look’d again  and the scene was new 



    she saw before her fair unfurl’d

    one half of all the glowing world 

    where oceans roll’d  and rivers ran 

    to bound the aims of sinful man 

    she saw a people  fierce and fell 

    burst frae their bounds like fiends of hell 

    their lilies grew  and the eagle flew 

    and she herkèd on her ravening crew 

    till the cities and towers were wrapp’d in a blaze 

    and the thunder it roar’d o’er the lands and the seas 

    the widows they wail’d  and the red blood ran 

    and she threatened an end to the race of man 

    she never lened  nor stood in awe 

    till caught by the lion’s deadly paw 

    o  then the eagle swink’d for life 

    and brainyell’d up a mortal strife 

    but flew she north  or flew she south 

    she met wi’ the gowl o’ the lion’s mouth 



    with a mooted wing and waefu’ maen 

    the eagle sought her eiry again 

    but lang may she cower in her bloody nest 

    and lang  lang sleek her wounded breast 



     gowl’d  howled  geck’d  mocked  arles  money paid on striking a

     bargain  fig  a beating  lened  crouched  swink’d  laboured 

     brainyell’d  stirred  beat  mooted  moulted 



    before she sey another flight 

    to play with the norland lion’s might 



    but to sing the sights kilmeny saw 

    so far surpassing nature’s law 

    the singer’s voice wad sink away 

    and the string of his harp wad cease to play 

    but she saw till the sorrows of man were bye 

    and all was love and harmony 

    till the stars of heaven fell calmly away 

    like flakes of snaw on a winter day 



    then kilmeny begg’d again to see

    the friends she had left in her own countrye 

    to tell of the place where she had been 

    and the glories that lay in the land unseen 

    to warn the living maidens fair 

    the loved of heaven  the spirits’ care 

    that all whose minds unmeled remain

    shall bloom in beauty when time is gane 



    with distant music  soft and deep 

    they lull’d kilmeny sound asleep 

    and when she awaken’d  she lay her lane 

    all happ’d with flowers  in the green wood wene 

    when seven lang years had come and fled 

    when grief was calm  and hope was dead 

    when scarce was remember’d kilmeny’s name 

    late  late in a gloamin’ kilmeny came hame 

    and o  her beauty was fair to see 

    but still and steadfast was her e’e 

    such beauty bard may never declare 

    for there was no pride nor passion there 



     sey  essay  unmeled  unblemished  her lane  alone  by herself 



    and the soft desire of maiden’s e’en

    in that mild face could never be seen 

    her seymar was the lily flower 

    and her cheek the moss rose in the shower 

    and her voice like the distant melodye 

    that floats along the twilight sea 

    but she loved to raike the lanely glen 

    and keepèd afar frae the haunts of men 

    her holy hymns unheard to sing 

    to suck the flowers  and drink the spring 

    but wherever her peaceful form appear’d 

    the wild beasts of the hill were cheer’d 

    the wolf play’d blythly round the field 

    the lordly byson low’d and kneel’d 

    the dun deer woo’d with manner bland 

    and cower’d aneath her lily hand 

    and when at even the woodlands rung 

    when hymns of other worlds she sung

    in ecstasy of sweet devotion 

    o  then the glen was all in motion 

    the wild beasts of the forest came 

    broke from their bughts and faulds the tame 

    and goved around  charm’d and amazed 

    even the dull cattle croon’d and gazed 

    and murmur’d and look’d with anxious pain

    for something the mystery to explain 

    the buzzard came with the throstle cock 

    the corby left her houf in the rock 

    the blackbird alang wi’ the eagle flew 

    the hind came tripping o’er the dew

    the hawk and the hern attour them hung 

    and the merle and the mavis forhooy’d their young 

    and all in a peaceful ring were hurl’d 

    it was like an eve in a sinless world 



    when a month and a day had come and gane 

    kilmeny sought the green wood wene 

    there laid her down on the leaves sae green 

    and kilmeny on earth was never mair seen 

    but o  the words that fell from her mouth

    were words of wonder  and words of truth 

    but all the land were in fear and dread 

    for they kendna whether she was living or dead 

    it wasna her hame  and she couldna remain 

    she left this world of sorrow and pain 

    and return’d to the land of thought again

 lucy 





 515    i 



    strange fits of passion have i known 

      and i will dare to tell 

    but in the lover’s ear alone 

      what once to me befell 



    when she i loved look’d every day

      fresh as a rose in june 

    i to her cottage bent my way 

      beneath an evening moon 



    upon the moon i fix’d my eye 

    all over the wide lea 

    with quickening pace my horse drew nigh

    those paths so dear to me 



    and now we reach’d the orchard plot 

    and  as we climb’d the hill 

    the sinking moon to lucy’s cot

    came near and nearer still 



    in one of those sweet dreams i slept 

    kind nature’s gentlest boon 

    and all the while my eyes i kept

    on the descending moon 



    my horse moved on  hoof after hoof

    he raised  and never stopp’d 

    when down behind the cottage roof 

    at once  the bright moon dropp’d 



    what fond and wayward thoughts will slide

    into a lover’s head 

    ‘o mercy ’ to myself i cried 

    ‘if lucy should be dead ’





 516    ii 



    she dwelt among the untrodden ways

      beside the springs of dove 

    a maid whom there were none to praise

      and very few to love 



    a violet by a mossy stone

      half hidden from the eye 

    fair as a star  when only one

      is shining in the sky 





    she lived unknown  and few could know

      when lucy ceased to be 

    but she is in her grave  and oh 

      the difference to me 





 517    iii 



    i traveled among unknown men 

     in lands beyond the sea 

    nor  england  did i know till then

      what love i bore to thee 



    ’tis past  that melancholy dream 

      nor will i quit thy shore

    a second time  for still i seem

      to love thee more and more 



    among thy mountains did i feel

      the joy of my desire 

    and she i cherish’d turn’d her wheel

      beside an english fire 



    thy mornings show’d  thy nights conceal’d 

      the bowers where lucy play’d 

    and thine too is the last green field

      that lucy’s eyes survey’d 





 518    iv 



    three years she grew in sun and shower 

    then nature said  ‘a lovelier flower

      on earth was never sown 

    this child i to myself will take 

    she shall be mine  and i will make

      a lady of my own 





    ‘myself will to my darling be

    both law and impulse  and with me

      the girl  in rock and plain 

    in earth and heaven  in glade and bower 

    shall feel an overseeing power

      to kindle or restrain 



    ‘she shall be sportive as the fawn

    that wild with glee across the lawn

      or up the mountain springs 

    and hers shall be the breathing balm 

    and hers the silence and the calm

      of mute insensate things 



    ‘the floating clouds their state shall lend

    to her  for her the willow bend 

      nor shall she fail to see

    even in the motions of the storm

    grace that shall mould the maiden’s form

      by silent sympathy 



    ‘the stars of midnight shall be dear

    to her  and she shall lean her ear

      in many a secret place

    where rivulets dance their wayward round 

    and beauty born of murmuring sound

      shall pass into her face 



    ‘and vital feelings of delight

    shall rear her form to stately height 

      her virgin bosom swell 

    such thoughts to lucy i will give

    while she and i together live

      here in this happy dell ’





    thus nature spake  the work was done  

    how soon my lucy’s race was run 

      she died  and left to me

    this heath  this calm and quiet scene 

    the memory of what has been 

      and never more will be 





 519    v 



    a slumber did my spirit seal 

      i had no human fears 

    she seem’d a thing that could not feel

      the touch of earthly years 



    no motion has she now  no force 

      she neither hears nor sees 

    roll’d round in earth’s diurnal course 

      with rocks  and stones  and trees 





 520    upon westminster bridge 



    earth has not anything to show more fair 

      dull would he be of soul who could pass by

      a sight so touching in its majesty 

    this city now doth like a garment wear

    the beauty of the morning  silent  bare 

      ships  towers  domes  theatres  and temples lie

      open unto the fields  and to the sky 

    all bright and glittering in the smokeless air 

    never did sun more beautifully steep

      in his first splendour valley  rock  or hill 

    ne’er saw i  never felt  a calm so deep 

      the river glideth at his own sweet will 

    dear god  the very houses seem asleep 

      and all that mighty heart is lying still 





 521    evening on calais beach 



    it is a beauteous evening  calm and free 

      the holy time is quiet as a nun

      breathless with adoration  the broad sun

    is sinking down in its tranquillity 

    the gentleness of heaven broods o’er the sea 

      listen  the mighty being is awake 

      and doth with his eternal motion make

    a sound like thunder  everlastingly 

    dear child  dear girl  that walkest with me here 

      if thou appear untouch’d by solemn thought 

      thy nature is not therefore less divine 

    thou liest in abraham’s bosom all the year 

      and worshipp’st at the temple’s inner shrine 

      god being with thee when we know it not 





 522    on the extinction of the venetian republic  1802 



    once did she hold the gorgeous east in fee 

      and was the safeguard of the west  the worth

      of venice did not fall below her birth 

    venice  the eldest child of liberty 

    she was a maiden city  bright and free 

      no guile seduced  no force could violate 

      and  when she took unto herself a mate 

    she must espouse the everlasting sea 

    and what if she had seen those glories fade 

      those titles vanish  and that strength decay 

    yet shall some tribute of regret be paid

      when her long life hath reach’d its final day 

    men are we  and must grieve when even the shade

      of that which once was great is pass’d away 





 england  1802 



 523    i 



    o friend  i know not which way i must look

      for comfort  being  as i am  opprest 

      to think that now our life is only drest

    for show  mean handy work of craftsman  cook 

    or groom   we must run glittering like a brook

      in the open sunshine  or we are unblest 

      the wealthiest man among us is the best 

    no grandeur now in nature or in book

    delights us  rapine  avarice  expense 

      this is idolatry  and these we adore 

      plain living and high thinking are no more 

      the homely beauty of the good old cause

    is gone  our peace  our fearful innocence 

      and pure religion breathing household laws

    milton  thou shouldst be living at this hour 

      england hath need of thee  she is a fen

      of stagnant waters  altar  sword  and pen 

    fireside  the heroic wealth of hall and bower 

    have forfeited their ancient english dower

      of inward happiness  we are selfish men 

      o raise us up  return to us again 

    and give us manners  virtue  freedom  power 

    thy soul was like a star  and dwelt apart 

      thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea 

      pure as the naked heavens  majestic  free 

      so didst thou travel on life’s common way 

    in cheerful godliness  and yet thy heart

      the lowliest duties on herself did lay 





 525    iii 



    great men have been among us  hands that penn’d

      and tongues that utter’d wisdom  better none 

      the later sidney  marvel  harrington 

    young vane  and others who call’d milton friend 

    these moralists could act and comprehend 

      they knew how genuine glory was put on 

      taught us how rightfully a nation shone

    in splendour  what strength was  that would not bend

    but in magnanimous meekness  france  ’tis strange 

      hath brought forth no such souls as we had then 

    perpetual emptiness  unceasing change 

      no single volume paramount  no code 

      no master spirit  no determined road 

      but equally a want of books and men 





 526    iv 



    it is not to be thought of that the flood

      of british freedom  which  to the open sea

      of the world’s praise  from dark antiquity

    hath flow’d  ‘with pomp of waters  unwithstood ’  

    roused though it be full often to a mood

      which spurns the check of salutary bands   

      that this most famous stream in bogs and sands

    should perish  and to evil and to good

    be lost for ever  in our halls is hung

      armoury of the invincible knights of old 

    we must be free or die  who speak the tongue

      that shakespeare spake  the faith and morals hold

    which milton held   in everything we are sprung

      of earth’s first blood  have titles manifold 





 527    v 



    when i have borne in memory what has tamed

      great nations  how ennobling thoughts depart

      when men change swords for ledgers  and desert

    the student’s bower for gold  some fears unnamed

    i had  my country  am i to be blamed 

      now  when i think of thee  and what thou art 

      verily  in the bottom of my heart 

    of those unfilial fears i am ashamed 

    for dearly must we prize thee  we who find

      in thee a bulwark for the cause of men 

      and i by my affection was beguiled 

    what wonder if a poet now and then 

    among the many movements of his mind 

      felt for thee as a lover or a child 



 528    the solitary reaper 







    behold her  single in the field 

      yon solitary highland lass 

    reaping and singing by herself 

      stop here  or gently pass 

    alone she cuts and binds the grain 

    and sings a melancholy strain 

    o listen  for the vale profound

    is overflowing with the sound 



    no nightingale did ever chaunt

      more welcome notes to weary bands

    of travellers in some shady haunt 

      among arabian sands 



    a voice so thrilling ne er was heard

    in spring time from the cuckoo bird 

    breaking the silence of the seas

    among the farthest hebrides 



    will no one tell me what she sings   

      perhaps the plaintive numbers flow

    for old  unhappy  far off things 

      and battles long ago 

    or is it some more humble lay 

    familiar matter of to day 

    some natural sorrow  loss  or pain 

    that has been  and may be again 



    whatever the theme  the maiden sang

      as if her song could have no ending 

    i saw her singing at her work 

      and o er the sickle bending   

    i listen d  motionless and still 

    and  as i mounted up the hill 

    the music in my heart i bore 

    long after it was heard no more 



 529    perfect woman 



    she was a phantom of delight

    when first she gleam’d upon my sight 

    a lovely apparition  sent

    to be a moment’s ornament 

    her eyes as stars of twilight fair 

    like twilight’s  too  her dusky hair 

    but all things else about her drawn

    from may time and the cheerful dawn 

    a dancing shape  an image gay 

    to haunt  to startle  and waylay 





    i saw her upon nearer view 

    a spirit  yet a woman too 

    her household motions light and free 

    and steps of virgin liberty 

    a countenance in which did meet

    sweet records  promises as sweet 

    a creature not too bright or good

    for human nature’s daily food 

    for transient sorrows  simple wiles 

    praise  blame  love  kisses  tears  and smiles 



    and now i see with eye serene

    the very pulse of the machine 

    a being breathing thoughtful breath 

    a traveller between life and death 

    the reason firm  the temperate will 

    endurance  foresight  strength  and skill 

    a perfect woman  nobly plann’d 

    to warn  to comfort  and command 

    and yet a spirit still  and bright

    with something of angelic light 





 530    daffodils 



    i wander’d lonely as a cloud

      that floats on high o’er vales and hills 

    when all at once i saw a crowd 

      a host  of golden daffodils 

    beside the lake  beneath the trees 

    fluttering and dancing in the breeze 



    continuous as the stars that shine

      and twinkle on the milky way 

    they stretch’d in never ending line

      along the margin of a bay 

    ten thousand saw i at a glance 

    tossing their heads in sprightly dance 



    the waves beside them danced  but they

      out did the sparkling waves in glee 

    a poet could not but be gay 

      in such a jocund company 

    i gazed  and gazed  but little thought

    what wealth the show to me had brought 



    for oft  when on my couch i lie

      in vacant or in pensive mood 

    they flash upon that inward eye

      which is the bliss of solitude 

    and then my heart with pleasure fills 

    and dances with the daffodils 





 531    ode to duty 



    stern daughter of the voice of god 

    o duty  if that name thou love 

    who art a light to guide  a rod

    to check the erring and reprove 

    thou  who art victory and law

    when empty terrors overawe 

    from vain temptations dost set free 

    and calm’st the weary strife of frail humanity 



    there are who ask not if thine eye

    be on them  who  in love and truth 

    where no misgiving is  rely

    upon the genial sense of youth 

    glad hearts  without reproach or blot 

    who do thy work  and know it not 

    o  if through confidence misplaced

    they fail  thy saving arms  dread power  around them cast 



    serene will be our days and bright 

    and happy will our nature be 

    when love is an unerring light 

    and joy its own security 

    and they a blissful course may hold

    even now  who  not unwisely bold 

    live in the spirit of this creed 

    yet seek thy firm support  according to their need 



    i  loving freedom  and untried 

    no sport of every random gust 

    yet being to myself a guide 

    too blindly have reposed my trust 

    and oft  when in my heart was heard

    thy timely mandate  i deferr’d

    the task  in smoother walks to stray 

    but thee i now would serve more strictly  if i may 



    through no disturbance of my soul 

    or strong compunction in me wrought 

    i supplicate for thy control 

    but in the quietness of thought 

    me this uncharter’d freedom tires 

    i feel the weight of chance desires 

    my hopes no more must change their name 

    i long for a repose that ever is the same 



    yet not the less would i throughout

    still act according to the voice

    of my own wish  and feel past doubt

    that my submissiveness was choice 

    not seeking in the school of pride

    for ‘precepts over dignified ’

    denial and restraint i prize

    no farther than they breed a second will more wise 



    stern lawgiver  yet thou dost wear

    the godhead’s most benignant grace 

    nor know we anything so fair

    as is the smile upon thy face 

    flowers laugh before thee on their beds 

    and fragrance in thy footing treads 

    thou dost preserve the stars from wrong 

    and the most ancient heavens  through thee  are fresh and strong 



    to humbler functions  awful power 

    i call thee  i myself commend

    unto thy guidance from this hour 

    o  let my weakness have an end 

    give unto me  made lowly wise 

    the spirit of self sacrifice 

    the confidence of reason give 

    and in the light of truth thy bondman let me live 





 532    the rainbow 



    my heart leaps up when i behold

    a rainbow in the sky 

    so was it when my life began 

    so is it now i am a man 

    so be it when i shall grow old 

            or let me die 

    the child is father of the man 

    and i could wish my days to be

    bound each to each by natural piety

      and students with their pensive citadels 

    maids at the wheel  the weaver at his loom 

    sit blithe and happy  bees that soar for bloom 

      high as the highest peak of furness fells 

      will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells 

    in truth the prison unto which we doom

    ourselves no prison is  and hence for me 

      in sundry moods  ’twas pastime to be bound

      within the sonnet’s scanty plot of ground 

    pleased if some souls  for such there needs must be 

    who have felt the weight of too much liberty 

      should find brief solace there  as i have found

 535    the world 



    the world is too much with us  late and soon 

      getting and spending  we lay waste our powers 

      little we see in nature that is ours 

    we have given our hearts away  a sordid boon 

    this sea that bares her bosom to the moon 

      the winds that will be howling at all hours 

      and are up gather’d now like sleeping flowers 

    for this  for everything  we are out of tune 

    it moves us not   great god  i’d rather be

      a pagan suckled in a creed outworn 

    so might i  standing on this pleasant lea 

      have glimpses that would make me less forlorn 

    have sight of proteus rising from the sea 

      or hear old triton blow his wreathèd horn 





 536    ode 



 intimations of immortality from recollections of early childhood 



    there was a time when meadow  grove  and stream 

        the earth  and every common sight 

                  to me did seem

        apparell’d in celestial light 

    the glory and the freshness of a dream 

    it is not now as it hath been of yore   

              turn wheresoe’er i may 

                  by night or day 

    the things which i have seen i now can see no more 

            the rainbow comes and goes 

            and lovely is the rose 

            the moon doth with delight

        look round her when the heavens are bare 

            waters on a starry night

            are beautiful and fair 

        the sunshine is a glorious birth 

        but yet i know  where’er i go 

    that there hath pass’d away a glory from the earth 



    now  while the birds thus sing a joyous song 

        and while the young lambs bound

            as to the tabor’s sound 

    to me alone there came a thought of grief 

    a timely utterance gave that thought relief 

            and i again am strong 

    the cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep 

    no more shall grief of mine the season wrong 

    i hear the echoes through the mountains throng 

    the winds come to me from the fields of sleep 

            and all the earth is gay 

                land and sea

        give themselves up to jollity 

          and with the heart of may

        doth every beast keep holiday   

              thou child of joy 

    shout round me  let me hear thy shouts  thou happy shepherd boy 



    ye blessèd creatures  i have heard the call

        ye to each other make  i see

    the heavens laugh with you in your jubilee 

        my heart is at your festival 

          my head hath its coronal 

    the fullness of your bliss  i feel  i feel it all 

            o evil day  if i were sullen

            while earth herself is adorning 

                this sweet may morning 

            and the children are culling

                on every side 

            in a thousand valleys far and wide 

            fresh flowers  while the sun shines warm 

    and the babe leaps up on his mother’s arm   

            i hear  i hear  with joy i hear 

           but there’s a tree  of many  one 

    a single field which i have look’d upon 

    both of them speak of something that is gone 

            the pansy at my feet

            doth the same tale repeat 

    whither is fled the visionary gleam 

    where is it now  the glory and the dream 



    our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting 

    the soul that rises with us  our life’s star 

            hath had elsewhere its setting 

              and cometh from afar 

            not in entire forgetfulness 

            and not in utter nakedness 

    but trailing clouds of glory do we come

            from god  who is our home 

    heaven lies about us in our infancy 

    shades of the prison house begin to close

            upon the growing boy 

    but he beholds the light  and whence it flows 

            he sees it in his joy 

    the youth  who daily farther from the east

        must travel  still is nature’s priest 

          and by the vision splendid

          is on his way attended 

    at length the man perceives it die away 

    and fade into the light of common day 



    earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own 

    yearnings she hath in her own natural kind 

    and  even with something of a mother’s mind 

            and no unworthy aim 

        the homely nurse doth all she can

    to make her foster child  her inmate man 

        forget the glories he hath known 

    and that imperial palace whence he came 



    behold the child among his new born blisses 

    a six years’ darling of a pigmy size 

    see  where ’mid work of his own hand he lies 

    fretted by sallies of his mother’s kisses 

    with light upon him from his father’s eyes 

    see  at his feet  some little plan or chart 

    some fragment from his dream of human life 

    shaped by himself with newly learnèd art 

        a wedding or a festival 

        a mourning or a funeral 

            and this hath now his heart 

        and unto this he frames his song 

            then will he fit his tongue

    to dialogues of business  love  or strife 

            but it will not be long

            ere this be thrown aside 

            and with new joy and pride

    the little actor cons another part 

    filling from time to time his ‘humorous stage’

    with all the persons  down to palsied age 

    that life brings with her in her equipage 

            as if his whole vocation

            were endless imitation 



    thou  whose exterior semblance doth belie

            thy soul’s immensity 

    thou best philosopher  who yet dost keep

    thy heritage  thou eye among the blind 

    that  deaf and silent  read’st the eternal deep 

    haunted for ever by the eternal mind   

            mighty prophet  seer blest 

            on whom those truths do rest 

    which we are toiling all our lives to find 

    in darkness lost  the darkness of the grave 

    thou  over whom thy immortality

    broods like the day  a master o’er a slave 

    a presence which is not to be put by 

                to whom the grave

    is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight

              of day or the warm light 

    a place of thought where we in waiting lie 

    thou little child  yet glorious in the might

    of heaven born freedom on thy being’s height 

    why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke

    the years to bring the inevitable yoke 

    thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife 

    full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight 

    and custom lie upon thee with a weight 

    heavy as frost  and deep almost as life 

            o joy  that in our embers

            is something that doth live 

            that nature yet remembers

            what was so fugitive 

    the thought of our past years in me doth breed

    perpetual benediction  not indeed

    for that which is most worthy to be blest  

    delight and liberty  the simple creed

    of childhood  whether busy or at rest 

    with new fledged hope still fluttering in his breast   

            not for these i raise

            the song of thanks and praise 

        but for those obstinate questionings

        of sense and outward things 

        fallings from us  vanishings 

        blank misgivings of a creature

    moving about in worlds not realized 

    high instincts before which our mortal nature

    did tremble like a guilty thing surprised 

            but for those first affections 

            those shadowy recollections 

          which  be they what they may 

    are yet the fountain light of all our day 

    are yet a master light of all our seeing 

    uphold us  cherish  and have power to make

    our noisy years seem moments in the being

    of the eternal silence  truths that wake 

                  to perish never 

    which neither listlessness  nor mad endeavour 

                  nor man nor boy 

    nor all that is at enmity with joy 

    can utterly abolish or destroy 

        hence in a season of calm weather

            though inland far we be 

    our souls have sight of that immortal sea

            which brought us hither 

        can in a moment travel thither 

    and see the children sport upon the shore 

    and hear the mighty waters rolling evermore 



    then sing  ye birds  sing  sing a joyous song 

            and let the young lambs bound

            as to the tabor’s sound 

    we in thought will join your throng 

          ye that pipe and ye that play 

          ye that through your hearts to day

          feel the gladness of the may 

    what though the radiance which was once so bright

    be now for ever taken from my sight 

        though nothing can bring back the hour

    of splendour in the grass  of glory in the flower 

          we will grieve not  rather find

          strength in what remains behind 

          in the primal sympathy

          which having been must ever be 

          in the soothing thoughts that spring

          out of human suffering 

          in the faith that looks through death 

    in years that bring the philosophic mind 



    and o ye fountains  meadows  hills  and groves 

    forebode not any severing of our loves 

    yet in my heart of hearts i feel your might 

    i only have relinquished one delight

    to live beneath your more habitual sway 

    i love the brooks which down their channels fret 

    even more than when i tripp’d lightly as they 

    the innocent brightness of a new born day

                  is lovely yet 

    the clouds that gather round the setting sun

    do take a sober colouring from an eye

    that hath kept watch o’er man’s mortality 

    another race hath been  and other palms are won 

    thanks to the human heart by which we live 

    thanks to its tenderness  its joys  and fears 

    to me the meanest flower that blows can give

    thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears 





 537    desideria 



    surprised by joy  impatient as the wind

      i turned to share the transport  o  with whom

      but thee  deep buried in the silent tomb 

    that spot which no vicissitude can find 

    love  faithful love  recall d thee to my mind  

      but how could i forget thee  through what power 

      even for the least division of an hour 

    have i been so beguiled as to be blind

    to my most grievous loss   that thought s return

      was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore 

    save one  one only  when i stood forlorn 

      knowing my heart s best treasure was no more 

    that neither present time  nor years unborn

      could to my sight that heavenly face restore 





 538    valedictory sonnet to the river duddon 



    i thought of thee  my partner and my guide 

      as being pass’d away   vain sympathies 

      for  backward  duddon  as i cast my eyes 

    i see what was  and is  and will abide 

    still glides the stream  and shall for ever glide 

      the form remains  the function never dies 

      while we  the brave  the mighty  and the wise 

    we men  who in our morn of youth defied

    the elements  must vanish   be it so 

      enough  if something from our hands have power

      to live  and act  and serve the future hour 

    and if  as toward the silent tomb we go 

      through love  through hope  and faith’s transcendent dower 

    we feel that we are greater than we know 





 539    mutability 



    from low to high doth dissolution climb 

      and sink from high to low  along a scale

      of awful notes  whose concord shall not fail 

    a musical but melancholy chime 

    which they can hear who meddle not with crime 

      nor avarice  nor over anxious care 

      truth fails not  but her outward forms that bear

    the longest date do melt like frosty rime 

    that in the morning whiten’d hill and plain

    and is no more  drop like the tower sublime

      of yesterday  which royally did wear

    his crown of weeds  but could not even sustain

      some casual shout that broke the silent air 

    or the unimaginable touch of time 





 540    the trosachs 



    there’s not a nook within this solemn pass

    but were an apt confessional for one

      taught by his summer spent  his autumn gone 

    that life is but a tale of morning grass

    wither’d at eve  from scenes of art which chase

      that thought away  turn  and with watchful eyes

      feed it ’mid nature’s old felicities 

    rocks  rivers  and smooth lakes more clear than glass

    untouch’d  unbreathed upon  thrice happy quest 

      if from a golden perch of aspen spray

       october’s workmanship to rival may 

    the pensive warbler of the ruddy breast

      that moral sweeten by a heaven taught lay 

    lulling the year  with all its cares  to rest 





 541    speak  



    why art thou silent  is thy love a plant

    of such weak fibre that the treacherous air

      of absence withers what was once so fair 

    is there no debt to pay  no boon to grant 

    yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant  

      bound to thy service with unceasing care 

    the mind’s least generous wish a mendicant

      for naught but what thy happiness could spare 

    speak  though this soft warm heart  once free to hold

      a thousand tender pleasures  thine and mine 

    be left more desolate  more dreary cold

      than a forsaken bird’s nest fill’d with snow

      ’mid its own bush of leafless eglantine  

      speak  that my torturing doubts their end may know

      would grace a summer queen 

    and as i rode by dalton hall 

      beneath the turrets high 

    a maiden on the castle wall

      was singing merrily   





    ‘o  brignall banks are fresh and fair 

      and greta woods are green 

    i’d rather rove with edmund there

      than reign our english queen ’

    to mute and to material things

    and in her glory reappears 

    but oh  my country’s wintry state

    what second spring shall renovate 

    what powerful call shall bid arise

      the buried warlike and the wise 

    the mind that thought for britain’s weal 

    the hand that grasp’d the victor steel 

    the vernal sun new life bestows

    even on the meanest flower that blows

    deep graved in every british heart 

    o never let those names depart 

    say to your sons   lo  here his grave 

    who victor died on gadite wave 

    to him  as to the burning levin

      his worth  who in his mightiest hour

    a bauble held the pride of power 

    spurn’d at the sordid lust of pelf 

    and served his albion for herself 

    who  when the frantic crowd amain

    strain’d at subjection’s bursting rein 

    o’er their wild mood full conquest gain’d 

    the pride he would not crush  restrain’d 

    show’d their fierce zeal a worthier cause 

    and brought the freeman’s arm to aid the freeman’s laws 



    hadst thou but lived  though stripp’d of power 

    a watchman on the lonely tower 

    thy thrilling trump had roused the land 

    when fraud or danger were at hand 

    by thee  as by the beacon light 

    our pilots had kept course aright 

    as some proud column  though alone 

    thy strength had propp’d the tottering throne 

    now is the stately column broke 

    the beacon light is quench’d in smoke 

    the trumpet’s silver voice is still 

    the warder silent on the hill 



    o think  how to his latest day 

    when death  just hovering  claim’d his prey 

    with palinure’s unalter’d mood

    firm at his dangerous post he stood 

    each call for needful rest repell’d 

    with dying hand the rudder held 

    till in his fall with fateful sway

    the steerage of the realm gave way 

    then  while on britain’s thousand plains

    one unpolluted church remains 

    whose peaceful bells ne’er sent around

    the bloody tocsin’s maddening sound 

    but still upon the hallow’d day

    convoke the swains to praise and pray 

    while faith and civil peace are dear 

    grace this cold marble with a tear   

    he who preserved them  pitt  lies here 



    nor yet suppress the generous sigh 

    because his rival slumbers nigh 

    nor be thy  requiescat  dumb

    lest it be said o’er fox’s tomb 

    for talents mourn  untimely lost 

    when best employ’d  and wanted most 

    mourn genius high  and lore profound 

    and wit that loved to play  not wound 

    and all the reasoning powers divine

    to penetrate  resolve  combine 

    and feelings keen  and fancy’s glow  

    they sleep with him who sleeps below 

    and  if thou mourn’st they could not save

    from error him who owns this grave 

    be every harsher thought suppress’d 

    and sacred be the last long rest 

     here   where the end of earthly things

    lays heroes  patriots  bards  and kings 

    where stiff the hand  and still the tongue 

    of those who fought  and spoke  and sung 

     here   where the fretted vaults prolong

    the distant notes of holy song 

    as if some angel spoke agen 

    ‘all peace on earth  good will to men’ 

    if ever from an english heart 

    o   here  let prejudice depart 

    and  partial feeling cast aside 

    record that fox a briton died 

    when europe crouch’d to france’s yoke 

    and austria bent  and prussia broke 

    and the firm russian’s purpose brave

    was bartered by a timorous slave  

    even then dishonour’s peace he spurn’d 

    the sullied olive branch return’d 

    stood for his country’s glory fast 

    and nail’d her colours to the mast 

    heaven  to reward his firmness  gave

    a portion in this honour’d grave 

    and ne’er held marble in its trust

    of two such wondrous men the dust 



    with more than mortal powers endow’d 

    how high they soar’d above the crowd 

    theirs was no common party race 

    jostling by dark intrigue for place 

    like fabled gods  their mighty war

    shook realms and nations in its jar 

    beneath each banner proud to stand 

    look’d up the noblest of the land 

    till through the british world were known

    the names of pitt and fox alone 

    spells of such force no wizard grave

    e’er framed in dark thessalian cave 

    though his could drain the ocean dry 

    and force the planets from the sky 

    these spells are spent  and  spent with these 

    the wine of life is on the lees 

    genius  and taste  and talent gone 

    for ever tomb’d beneath the stone 

    where  taming thought to human pride   

    the mighty chiefs sleep side by side 

    drop upon fox’s grave the tear 

    ’twill trickle to his rival’s bier 

    o’er pitt’s the mournful requiem sound 

    and fox’s shall the notes rebound 

    the solemn echo seems to cry 

    ‘here let their discord with them die 

    speak not for those a separate doom

    whom fate made brothers in the tomb 

    but search the land of living men 

    where wilt thou find their like agen ’

 549    the rime of the ancient mariner 





part i



 sidenote  an ancient mariner meeteth three gallants bidden to a wedding

feast  and detaineth one  



    it is an ancient mariner 

    and he stoppeth one of three 

    ‘by thy long grey beard and glittering eye 

    now wherefore stopp’st thou me 



    the bridegroom’s doors are open’d wide 

    and i am next of kin 

    the guests are met  the feast is set 

    may’st hear the merry din ’



    he holds him with his skinny hand 

    ‘there was a ship ’ quoth he 

    ‘hold off  unhand me  grey beard loon ’

    eftsoons his hand dropt he 



 sidenote  the wedding guest is spellbound by the eye of the old

seafaring man  and constrained to hear his tale  



    he holds him with his glittering eye  

    the wedding guest stood still 

    and listens like a three years’ child 

    the mariner hath his will 





    the wedding guest sat on a stone 

    he cannot choose but hear 

    and thus spake on that ancient man 

    the bright eyed mariner 



    ‘the ship was cheer’d  the harbour clear’d 

    merrily did we drop

    below the kirk  below the hill 

    below the lighthouse top 



 sidenote  the mariner tells how the ship sailed southward with a good

wind and fair weather  till it reached the line  



    the sun came up upon the left 

    out of the sea came he 

    and he shone bright  and on the right

    went down into the sea 



    higher and higher every day 

    till over the mast at noon    ’

    the wedding guest here beat his breast 

    for he heard the loud bassoon 



 sidenote  the wedding guest heareth the bridal music  but the mariner

continueth his tale  



    the bride hath paced into the hall 

    red as a rose is she 

    nodding their heads before her goes

    the merry minstrelsy 



    the wedding guest he beat his breast 

    yet he cannot choose but hear 

    and thus spake on that ancient man 

    the bright eyed mariner 



 sidenote  the ship drawn by a storm toward the south pole  



    ‘and now the storm blast came  and he

    was tyrannous and strong 

    he struck with his o’ertaking wings 

    and chased us south along 





    with sloping masts and dipping prow 

    as who pursued with yell and blow

    still treads the shadow of his foe 

    and forward bends his head 

    the ship drove fast  loud roar’d the blast 

    and southward aye we fled 



    and now there came both mist and snow 

    and it grew wondrous cold 

    and ice  mast high  came floating by 

    as green as emerald 



 sidenote  the land of ice  and of fearful sounds  where no living thing

was to be seen  



    and through the drifts the snowy clifts

    did send a dismal sheen 

    nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken  

    the ice was all between 



    the ice was here  the ice was there 

    the ice was all around 

    it crack’d and growl’d  and roar’d and howl’d 

    like noises in a swound 



 sidenote  till a great sea bird  called the albatross  came through the

snow fog  and was received with great joy and hospitality  



    at length did cross an albatross 

    thorough the fog it came 

    as if it had been a christian soul 

    we hail’d it in god’s name 



    it ate the food it ne’er had eat 

    and round and round it flew 

    the ice did split with a thunder fit 

    the helmsman steer’d us through 



 sidenote  and lo  the albatross proveth a bird of good omen  and

followeth the ship as it returned northward through fog and floating

ice  



    and a good south wind sprung up behind 

    the albatross did follow 

    and every day  for food or play 

    came to the mariners’ hollo 





    in mist or cloud  on mast or shroud 

    it perch’d for vespers nine 

    whiles all the night  through fog smoke white 

    glimmer’d the white moonshine ’



 sidenote  the ancient mariner inhospitably killeth the pious bird of

good omen  



    ‘god save thee  ancient mariner 

    from the fiends  that plague thee thus   

    why look’st thou so ’  ‘with my crossbow

    i shot the albatross 





part ii



    ‘the sun now rose upon the right 

    out of the sea came he 

    still hid in mist  and on the left

    went down into the sea 



    and the good south wind still blew behind 

    but no sweet bird did follow 

    nor any day for food or play

    came to the mariners’ hollo 



 sidenote  his shipmates cry out against the ancient mariner for killing

the bird of good luck  



    and i had done a hellish thing 

    and it would work ’em woe 

    for all averr’d i had kill’d the bird

    that made the breeze to blow 

    ah wretch  said they  the bird to slay 

    that made the breeze to blow 



 sidenote  but when the fog cleared off  they justify the same  and thus

make themselves accomplices in the crime  



    nor dim nor red  like god’s own head 

    the glorious sun uprist 

    then all averr’d i had kill’d the bird

    that brought the fog and mist 

    ’twas right  said they  such birds to slay 

    that bring the fog and mist 



 sidenote  the fair breeze continues  the ship enters the pacific ocean 

and sails northward  even till it reaches the line  



    the fair breeze blew  the white foam flew 

    the furrow follow’d free 

    we were the first that ever burst

    into that silent sea 



 sidenote  the ship hath been suddenly becalmed  



    down dropt the breeze  the sails dropt down 

    ’twas sad as sad could be 

    and we did speak only to break

    the silence of the sea 



    all in a hot and copper sky 

    the bloody sun  at noon 

    right up above the mast did stand 

    no bigger than the moon 



    day after day  day after day 

    we stuck  nor breath nor motion 

    as idle as a painted ship

    upon a painted ocean 



 sidenote  and the albatross begins to be avenged  



    water  water  everywhere 

    and all the boards did shrink 

    water  water  everywhere 

    nor any drop to drink 



    the very deep did rot  o christ 

    that ever this should be 

    yea  slimy things did crawl with legs

    upon the slimy sea 



    about  about  in reel and rout

    the death fires danced at night 

    the water  like a witch’s oils 

    burnt green  and blue  and white 



 sidenote  a spirit had followed them  one of the invisible inhabitants

of this planet  neither departed souls nor angels  concerning whom the

learned jew  josephus  and the platonic constantinopolitan  michael

psellus  may be consulted  they are very numerous  and there is no

climate or element without one or more  



    and some in dreams assurèd were

    or the spirit that plagued us so 

    nine fathom deep he had follow’d us

    from the land of mist and snow 



    and every tongue  through utter drought 

    was wither’d at the root 

    we could not speak  no more than if

    we had been choked with soot 



 sidenote  the shipmates in their sore distress  would fain throw the

whole guilt on the ancient mariner  in sign whereof they hang the dead

sea bird round his neck  



    ah  well a day  what evil looks

    had i from old and young 

    instead of the cross  the albatross

    about my neck was hung 





part iii



 sidenote  the ancient mariner beholdeth a sign in the element afar

off  



    ‘there passed a weary time  each throat

    was parch’d  and glazed each eye 

    a weary time  a weary time 

    how glazed each weary eye 

    when looking westward  i beheld

    a something in the sky 



    at first it seem’d a little speck 

    and then it seem’d a mist 

    it moved and moved  and took at last

    a certain shape  i wist 



    a speck  a mist  a shape  i wist 

    and still it near’d and near’d 

    as if it dodged a water sprite 

    it plunged  and tack’d  and veer’d 



 sidenote  at its nearer approach  it seemeth him to be a ship  and at a

dear ransom he freeth his speech from the bonds of thirst  



    with throats unslaked  with black lips baked 

    we could nor laugh nor wail 

    through utter drought all dumb we stood 

    i bit my arm  i suck’d the blood 

    and cried  a sail  a sail 



 sidenote  a flash of joy  



    with throats unslaked  with black lips baked 

    agape they heard me call 

    gramercy  they for joy did grin 

    and all at once their breath drew in 

    as they were drinking all 



 sidenote  and horror follows  for can it be a ship that comes onward

without wind or tide  



    see  see   i cried  she tacks no more 

    hither to work us weal  

    without a breeze  without a tide 

    she steadies with upright keel 



    the western wave was all aflame 

    the day was wellnigh done 

    almost upon the western wave

    rested the broad  bright sun 

    when that strange shape drove suddenly

    betwixt us and the sun 



 sidenote  it seemeth him but the skeleton of a ship  



    and straight the sun was fleck’d with bars

     heaven’s mother send us grace   

    as if through a dungeon grate he peer’d

    with broad and burning face 



    alas   thought i  and my heart beat loud 

    how fast she nears and nears 

    are those her sails that glance in the sun 

    like restless gossameres 



 sidenote  and its ribs are seen as bars on the face of the setting sun 

the spectre woman and her death mate  and no other  on board the

skeleton ship  like vessel  like crew  



    are those her ribs through which the sun

    did peer  as through a grate 

    and is that woman all her crew 

    is that a death  and are there two 

    is death that woman’s mate 



    her lips were red  her looks were free 

    her locks were yellow as gold 

    her skin was as white as leprosy 

    the nightmare life in death was she 

    who thicks man’s blood with cold 



 sidenote  death and life in death have diced for the ship’s crew  and

she  the latter  winneth the ancient mariner  



    the naked hulk alongside came 

    and the twain were casting dice 

    “the game is done  i’ve won  i’ve won ”

    quoth she  and whistles thrice 



 sidenote  no twilight within the courts of the sun  



    the sun’s rim dips  the stars rush out 

    at one stride comes the dark 

    with far heard whisper  o’er the sea 

    off shot the spectre bark 



 sidenote  at the rising of the moon  



    we listen’d and look’d sideways up 

    fear at my heart  as at a cup 

    my life blood seem’d to sip 

    the stars were dim  and thick the night 

    the steersman’s face by his lamp gleam’d white 

    from the sails the dew did drip  

    till clomb above the eastern bar

    the hornèd moon  with one bright star

    within the nether tip 



 sidenote  one after another  



    one after one  by the star dogg’d moon 

    too quick for groan or sigh 

    each turn’d his face with a ghastly pang 

    and cursed me with his eye 



 sidenote  his shipmates drop down dead  



    four times fifty living men

     and i heard nor sigh nor groan  

    with heavy thump  a lifeless lump 

    they dropp’d down one by one 



 sidenote  but life in death begins her work on the ancient mariner  



    the souls did from their bodies fly  

    they fled to bliss or woe 

    and every soul  it pass’d me by

    like the whizz of my crossbow ’





part iv



 sidenote  the wedding guest feareth that a spirit is talking to him  



    ‘i fear thee  ancient mariner 

    i fear thy skinny hand 

    and thou art long  and lank  and brown 

    as is the ribb’d sea sand 



 sidenote  but the ancient mariner assureth him of his bodily life  and

proceedeth to relate his horrible penance  



    i fear thee and thy glittering eye 

    and thy skinny hand so brown ’  

    ‘fear not  fear not  thou wedding guest 

    this body dropt not down 



    alone  alone  all  all alone 

    alone on a wide  wide sea 

    and never a saint took pity on

    my soul in agony 



 sidenote  he despiseth the creatures of the calm  



    the many men  so beautiful 

    and they all dead did lie 

    and a thousand thousand slimy things

    lived on  and so did i 



 sidenote  and envieth that they should live  and so many lie dead  



    i look’d upon the rotting sea 

    and drew my eyes away 

    i look’d upon the rotting deck 

    and there the dead men lay 





    i look’d to heaven  and tried to pray 

    but or ever a prayer had gusht 

    a wicked whisper came  and made

    my heart as dry as dust 



    i closed my lids  and kept them close 

    and the balls like pulses beat 

    but the sky and the sea  and the sea and the sky 

    lay like a load on my weary eye 

    and the dead were at my feet 



 sidenote  but the curse liveth for him in the eye of the dead men  



    the cold sweat melted from their limbs 

    nor rot nor reek did they 

    the look with which they look’d on me

    had never pass’d away 



    an orphan’s curse would drag to hell

    a spirit from on high 

    but oh  more horrible than that

    is the curse in a dead man’s eye 

    seven days  seven nights  i saw that curse 

    and yet i could not die 



 sidenote  in his loneliness and fixedness he yearneth towards the moon 

and the stars that still sojourn  yet still move onward  and everywhere

the blue sky belongs to them  and is their appointed rest and their

native country and their own natural homes  which they enter

unannounced  as lords that are certainly expected  and yet there is a

silent joy at their arrival  



    the moving moon went up the sky 

    and nowhere did abide 

    softly she was going up 

    and a star or two beside  



    her beams bemock’d the sultry main 

    like april hoar frost spread 

    but where the ship’s huge shadow lay 

    the charmèd water burnt alway

    a still and awful red 



 sidenote  by the light of the moon he beholdeth god’s creatures of the

great calm  



    beyond the shadow of the ship 

    i watch’d the water snakes 

    they moved in tracks of shining white 

    and when they rear’d  the elfish light

    fell off in hoary flakes 



    within the shadow of the ship

    i watch’d their rich attire 

    blue  glossy green  and velvet black 

    they coil’d and swam  and every track

    was a flash of golden fire 



 sidenote  their beauty and their happiness  



 sidenote  he blesseth them in his heart  



    o happy living things  no tongue

    their beauty might declare 

    a spring of love gush’d from my heart 

    and i bless’d them unaware 

    sure my kind saint took pity on me 

    and i bless’d them unaware 



 sidenote  the spell begins to break  



    the selfsame moment i could pray 

    and from my neck so free

    the albatross fell off  and sank

    like lead into the sea 





part v



    ‘o sleep  it is a gentle thing 

    beloved from pole to pole 

    to mary queen the praise be given 

    she sent the gentle sleep from heaven 

    that slid into my soul 



 sidenote  by grace of the holy mother  the ancient mariner is refreshed

with rain  



    the silly buckets on the deck 

    that had so long remain’d 

    i dreamt that they were fill’d with dew 

    and when i awoke  it rain’d 





    my lips were wet  my throat was cold 

    my garments all were dank 

    sure i had drunken in my dreams 

    and still my body drank 



    i moved  and could not feel my limbs 

    i was so light  almost

    i thought that i had died in sleep 

    and was a blessèd ghost 



 sidenote  he heareth sounds and seeth strange sights and commotions in

the sky and the element  



    and soon i heard a roaring wind 

    it did not come anear 

    but with its sound it shook the sails 

    that were so thin and sere 



    the upper air burst into life 

    and a hundred fire flags sheen 

    to and fro they were hurried about 

    and to and fro  and in and out 

    the wan stars danced between 



    and the coming wind did roar more loud 

    and the sails did sigh like sedge 

    and the rain pour’d down from one black cloud 

    the moon was at its edge 



    the thick black cloud was cleft  and still

    the moon was at its side 

    like waters shot from some high crag 

    the lightning fell with never a jag 

    a river steep and wide 



 sidenote  the bodies of the ship’s crew are inspired  and the ship

moves on  



    the loud wind never reached the ship 

    yet now the ship moved on 

    beneath the lightning and the moon

    the dead men gave a groan 





    they groan’d  they stirr’d  they all uprose 

    nor spake  nor moved their eyes 

    it had been strange  even in a dream 

    to have seen those dead men rise 



    the helmsman steer’d  the ship moved on 

    yet never a breeze up blew 

    the mariners all ’gan work the ropes 

    where they were wont to do 

    they raised their limbs like lifeless tools  

    we were a ghastly crew 



    the body of my brother’s son

    stood by me  knee to knee 

    the body and i pull’d at one rope 

    but he said naught to me ’



 sidenote  but not by the souls of the men  nor by demons of earth or

middle air  but by a blessed troop of angelic spirits  sent down by the

invocation of the guardian saint  



    ‘i fear thee  ancient mariner ’

    ‘be calm  thou wedding guest 

    ’twas not those souls that fled in pain 

    which to their corses came again 

    but a troop of spirits blest 



    for when it dawn’d  they dropp’d their arms 

    and cluster’d round the mast 

    sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths 

    and from their bodies pass’d 



    around  around  flew each sweet sound 

    then darted to the sun 

    slowly the sounds came back again 

    now mix’d  now one by one 



    sometimes a dropping from the sky

    i heard the skylark sing 

    sometimes all little birds that are 

    how they seem’d to fill the sea and air

    with their sweet jargoning 





    and now ’twas like all instruments 

    now like a lonely flute 

    and now it is an angel’s song 

    that makes the heavens be mute 



    it ceased  yet still the sails made on

    a pleasant noise till noon 

    a noise like of a hidden brook

    in the leafy month of june 

    that to the sleeping woods all night

    singeth a quiet tune 



    till noon we quietly sail’d on 

    yet never a breeze did breathe 

    slowly and smoothly went the ship 

    moved onward from beneath 



 sidenote  the lonesome spirit from the south pole carries on the ship

as far as the line  in obedience to the angelic troop  but still

requireth vengeance  



    under the keel nine fathom deep 

    from the land  of mist and snow 

    the spirit slid  and it was he

    that made the ship to go 

    the sails at noon left off their tune 

    and the ship stood still also 



    the sun  right up above the mast

    i woke  and we were sailing on

    as in a gentle weather 

    ’twas night  calm night  the moon was high 

    the dead men stood together 



    all stood together on the deck 

    for a charnel dungeon fitter 

    all fix’d on me their stony eyes 

    that in the moon did glitter

    had never pass’d away

    like one that on a lonesome road

    doth walk in fear and dread 

    and having once turned round  walks on 

    and turns no more his head 

    because he knows a frightful fiend

    doth close behind him tread 



    but soon there breathed a wind on me 

    nor sound nor motion made 

    its path was not upon the sea 

    in ripple or in shade 



    it raised my hair  it fann’d my cheek

    like a meadow gale of spring  

    it mingled strangely with my fears 

    yet it felt like a welcoming 



    swiftly  swiftly flew the ship 

    yet she sail’d softly too 

    sweetly  sweetly blew the breeze  

    on me alone it blew

    we drifted o’er the harbour bar 

    and i with sobs did pray  

    o let me be awake  my god 

    or let me sleep alway 



    the harbour bay was clear as glass 

    so smoothly it was strewn 

    and on the bay the moonlight lay 

    and the shadow of the moon

    i turn’d my eyes upon the deck

    each corse lay flat  lifeless and flat 

    and  by the holy rood 

    a man all light  a seraph man 

    on every corse there stood 



    this seraph band  each waved his hand 

    it was a heavenly sight 

    they stood as signals to the land 

    each one a lovely light 



    this seraph band  each waved his hand 

    no voice did they impart  

    no voice  but o  the silence sank

    like music on my heart 



    but soon i heard the dash of oars 

    i heard the pilot’s cheer 

    my head was turn’d perforce away 

    and i saw a boat appear 





    the pilot and the pilot’s boy 

    i heard them coming fast 

    dear lord in heaven  it was a joy

    the dead men could not blast 



    i saw a third  i heard his voice 

    it is the hermit good 

    he singeth loud his godly hymns

    but swift as dreams  myself i found

    within the pilot’s boat

    was telling of the sound 



    i moved my lips  the pilot shriek’d

    and fell down in a fit

    and pray’d where he did sit 





    i took the oars  the pilot’s boy 

    who now doth crazy go 

    laugh’d loud and long  and all the while

    his eyes went to and fro 

    “ha  ha ” quoth he  “full plain i see

      in xanadu did kubla khan

        a stately pleasure dome decree 

      where alph  the sacred river  ran

      through caverns measureless to man

        down to a sunless sea 

      so twice five miles of fertile ground

      with walls and towers were girdled round 

    and there were gardens bright with sinuous rills

    where blossom’d many an incense bearing tree 

    and here were forests ancient as the hills 

    enfolding sunny spots of greenery 



    but o  that deep romantic chasm which slanted

    down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover 

    a savage place  as holy and enchanted

    as e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted

    by woman wailing for her demon lover 

    and from this chasm  with ceaseless turmoil seething 

    as if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing 

    a mighty fountain momently was forced 

    amid whose swift half intermitted burst

    huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail 

    or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail 

    and ’mid these dancing rocks at once and ever

    it flung up momently the sacred river 

    five miles meandering with a mazy motion

    through wood and dale the sacred river ran 

    then reach’d the caverns measureless to man 

    and sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean 

    and ’mid this tumult kubla heard from far

    ancestral voices prophesying war 

      the shadow of the dome of pleasure

        floated midway on the waves 

      where was heard the mingled measure

        from the fountain and the caves 

    it was a miracle of rare device 

    a sunny pleasure dome with caves of ice 



      a damsel with a dulcimer

        in a vision once i saw 

      it was an abyssinian maid 

        and on her dulcimer she play’d 

      singing of mount abora 

      could i revive within me 

    her symphony and song 

    to such a deep delight ’twould win me 

    that with music loud and long 

    i would build that dome in air 

    that sunny dome  those caves of ice 

    and all who heard should see them there 

    and all should cry  beware  beware 

    his flashing eyes  his floating hair 

    weave a circle round him thrice 

      and close your eyes with holy dread 

      for he on honey dew hath fed 

    and drunk the milk of paradise

        whatever stirs this mortal frame 

    all are but ministers of love 

        and feed his sacred flame 



    oft in my waking dreams do i

    live o’er again that happy hour 

    when midway on the mount i lay 

        beside the ruin’d tower 



    the moonshine  stealing o’er the scene 

    had blended with the lights of eve 

    and she was there  my hope  my joy 

        my own dear genevieve 



    she lean’d against the armèd man 

    the statue of the armèd knight 

    she stood and listen’d to my lay 

        amid the lingering light 



    few sorrows hath she of her own 

    my hope  my joy  my genevieve 

    she loves me best whene’er i sing

        the songs that make her grieve 



    i play’d a soft and doleful air 

    i sang an old and moving story  

    an old rude song  that suited well

        that ruin wild and hoary 



    she listen’d with a flitting blush 

    with downcast eyes and modest grace 

    for well she knew i could not choose

        but gaze upon her face 



    i told her of the knight that wore

    upon his shield a burning brand 

    and that for ten long years he woo’d

        the lady of the land 



    i told her how he pined  and ah 

    the deep  the low  the pleading tone

    with which i sang another’s love 

        interpreted my own 



    she listened with a flitting blush 

    with downcast eyes  and modest grace 

    and she forgave me  that i gazed

        too fondly on her face 



    but when i told the cruel scorn

    that crazed that bold and lovely knight 

    and that he cross’d the mountain woods 

        nor rested day nor night 



    that sometimes from the savage den 

    and sometimes from the darksome shade 

    and sometimes starting up at once

        in green and sunny glade  



    there came and look’d him in the face

    an angel beautiful and bright 

    and that he knew it was a fiend 

        this miserable knight 



    and that  unknowing what he did 

    he leap’d amid a murderous band 

    and saved from outrage worse than death

        the lady of the land   



    and how she wept and clasp’d his knees 

    and how she tended him in vain  

    and ever strove to expiate

        the scorn that crazed his brain   



    and that she nursed him in a cave 

    and how his madness went away 

    when on the yellow forest leaves

        a dying man he lay   



    his dying words  but when i reach’d

    that tenderest strain of all the ditty 

    my faltering voice and pausing harp

        disturb’d her soul with pity 



    all impulses of soul and sense

    had thrill’d my guileless genevieve 

    the music and the doleful tale 

        the rich and balmy eve 



    and hopes  and fears that kindle hope 

    an undistinguishable throng 

    and gentle wishes long subdued 

        subdued and cherish’d long 



    she wept with pity and delight 

    she blush’d with love and virgin shame 

    and like the murmur of a dream 

        i heard her breathe my name 



    her bosom heaved  she stepp’d aside 

    as conscious of my look she stept  

    then suddenly  with timorous eye

        she fled to me and wept 



    she half enclosed me with her arms 

    she press’d me with a meek embrace 

    and bending back her head  look’d up 

        and gazed upon my face 



    ’twas partly love  and partly fear 

    and partly ’twas a bashful art 

    that i might rather feel  than see 

        the swelling of her heart 



    i calm’d her fears  and she was calm 

    and told her love with virgin pride 

    and so i won my genevieve 

        my bright and beauteous bride

    like those trim skiffs  unknown of yore 

    on winding lakes and rivers wide 

    that ask no aid of sail or oar 

    that fear no spite of wind or tide 

    naught cared this body for wind or weather

    what strange disguise hast now put on 

    to make believe that thou art gone

    and tears take sunshine from thine eyes

    that only serves to make us grieve

    wears on his smiling face a dream of spring 

    and i  the while  the sole unbusy thing 

    nor honey make  nor pair  nor build  nor sing 



    yet well i ken the banks where amaranths blow 

    have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow 

    bloom  o ye amaranths  bloom for whom ye may 

    for me ye bloom not  glide  rich streams  away 

    with lips unbrighten’d  wreathless brow  i stroll 

    and would you learn the spells that drowse my soul

      from sky to earth it slanted 

    and poised therein a bird so bold

      within that shaft of sunny mist 

    his eyes of fire  his beak of gold 

      all else of amethyst 



    and thus he sang  ‘adieu  adieu

    with them i take delight in weal

      and seek relief in woe 

    and while i understand and feel

    my thoughts are with the dead  with them

    their virtues love  their faults condemn 

      partake their hopes and fears 

    and from their lessons seek and find

    instruction with an humble mind 



    my hopes are with the dead  anon

    i loved him not  and yet now he is gone 

            i feel i am alone 

    i check’d him while he spoke  yet  could he speak 

            alas  i would not check 

    for reasons not to love him once i sought 

            and wearied all my thought

    to vex myself and him  i now would give

            my love  could he but live

    who lately lived for me  and when he found

            ’twas vain  in holy ground

    he hid his face amid the shades of death 

            i waste for him my breath

    who wasted his for me  but mine returns 

            and this lorn bosom burns

    with stifling heat  heaving it up in sleep 

            and waking me to weep

    tears that had melted his soft heart  for years

            wept he as bitter tears 

    ‘merciful god ’ such was his latest prayer 

            ‘these may she never share ’

    quieter is his breath  his breast more cold

            than daisies in the mould 

    where children spell  athwart the churchyard gate 

            his name and life’s brief date 

    pray for him  gentle souls  whoe’er you be 

            and  o  pray too for me

    ah  what avails the sceptred race 

      ah  what the form divine 

    what every virtue  every grace 

      rose aylmer  all were thine 



    rose aylmer  whom these wakeful eyes

      may weep  but never see 

    a night of memories and sighs

      i consecrate to thee 





 559    ianthe 



    from you  ianthe  little troubles pass

      like little ripples down a sunny river 

    your pleasures spring like daisies in the grass 

      cut down  and up again as blithe as ever 





 560    twenty years hence 



    twenty years hence my eyes may grow 

    if not quite dim  yet rather so 

    yet yours from others they shall know 

                    twenty years hence 



    twenty years hence  though it may hap

    that i be call’d to take a nap

    in a cool cell where thunder clap

                    was never heard 



    there breathe but o’er my arch of grass

    a not too sadly sigh’d ‘alas ’

    and i shall catch  ere you can pass 

                    that wingèd word 





 561    verse 



    past ruin’d ilion helen lives 

      alcestis rises from the shades 

    verse calls them forth  ’tis verse that gives

      immortal youth to mortal maids 



    soon shall oblivion’s deepening veil

      hide all the peopled hills you see 

    the gay  the proud  while lovers hail

      these many summers you and me 





 562    proud word you never spoke 



    proud word you never spoke  but you will speak

      four not exempt from pride some future day 

    resting on one white hand a warm wet cheek 

      over my open volume you will say 

      ‘this man loved me’  then rise and trip away 





 563    resignation 



    why  why repine  my pensive friend 

      at pleasures slipp’d away 

    some the stern fates will never lend 

      and all refuse to stay 



    i see the rainbow in the sky 

      the dew upon the grass 

    i see them  and i ask not why

      they glimmer or they pass 



    with folded arms i linger not

      to call them back  ’twere vain 

    in this  or in some other spot 

      i know they’ll shine again 





 564    mother  i cannot mind my wheel 



    mother  i cannot mind my wheel 

      my fingers ache  my lips are dry 

    o  if you felt the pain i feel 

      but o  who ever felt as i 



    no longer could i doubt him true  

      all other men may use deceit 

    he always said my eyes were blue 

      and often swore my lips were sweet 





 565    autumn 



    mild is the parting year  and sweet

      the odour of the falling spray 

    life passes on more rudely fleet 

      and balmless is its closing day 



    i wait its close  i court its gloom 

      but mourn that never must there fall

    or on my breast or on my tomb

      the tear that would have soothed it all 





 566    remain  



    remain  ah not in youth alone 

      tho’ youth  where you are  long will stay  

    but when my summer days are gone 

      and my autumnal haste away 

    ‘ can i be always by your side  ’

      no  but the hours you can  you must 

    nor rise at death’s approaching stride 

      nor go when dust is gone to dust 





 567    absence 



    here  ever since you went abroad 

      if there be change  no change i see 

    i only walk our wonted road 

      the road is only walk’d by me 



    yes  i forgot  a change there is  

      was it of  that  you bade me tell 

    i catch at times  at times i miss

      the sight  the tone  i know so well 





    only two months since you stood here 

      two shortest months  then tell me why

    voices are harsher than they were 

      and tears are longer ere they dry 





 568    of clementina 



    in clementina’s artless mien

      lucilla asks me what i see 

    and are the roses of sixteen

                  enough for me 



    lucilla asks  if that be all 

      have i not cull’d as sweet before 

    ah yes  lucilla  and their fall

                  i still deplore 



    i now behold another scene 

      where pleasure beams with heaven’s own light 

    more pure  more constant  more serene 

                  and not less bright 



    faith  on whose breast the loves repose 

      whose chain of flowers no force can sever 

    and modesty who  when she goes 

                  is gone for ever 





 569    ianthe’s question 



    ‘do you remember me  or are you proud ’

    lightly advancing thro’ her star trimm’d crowd 

      ianthe said  and look’d into my eyes 

    ‘a  yes   a  yes  to both  for memory

    where you but once have been must ever be 

      and at your voice pride from his throne must rise ’





 570    on catullus 



    tell me not what too well i know

    about the bard of sirmio 

      yes  in thalia’s son

    such stains there are  as when a grace

    sprinkles another’s laughing face

      with nectar  and runs on 





 571    dirce 



    stand close around  ye stygian set 

      with dirce in one boat convey’d 

    or charon  seeing  may forget

      that he is old and she a shade 





 572    alciphron and leucippe 



    an ancient chestnut’s blossoms threw

    their heavy odour over two 

    leucippe  it is said  was one 

    the other  then  was alciphron 

    ‘come  come  why should we stand beneath

    this hollow tree’s unwholesome breath ’

    said alciphron  ‘here’s not a blade

    of grass or moss  and scanty shade 

    come  it is just the hour to rove

    in the lone dingle shepherds love 

    there  straight and tall  the hazel twig

    divides the crookèd rock held fig 

    o’er the blue pebbles where the rill

    in winter runs and may run still 

    come then  while fresh and calm the air 

    and while the shepherds are not there ’



     leucippe   but i would rather go when they

                sit round about and sing and play 

                then why so hurry me  for you

                like play and song  and shepherds too 



     alciphron   i like the shepherds very well 

                and song and play  as you can tell 

                but there is play  i sadly fear 

                and song i would not have you hear 



     leucippe   what can it be  what can it be 



     alciphron   to you may none of them repeat

                the play that you have play’d with me 

                the song that made your bosom beat 



     leucippe   don’t keep your arm about my waist 



     alciphron   might you not stumble 



     leucippe   well then  do 

                but why are we in all this haste 



     alciphron   to sing 



     leucippe   alas  and not play too 





 573    years 



    years  many parti colour’d years 

      some have crept on  and some have flown

    since first before me fell those tears

      i never could see fall alone 



    years  not so many  are to come 

      years not so varied  when from you

    one more will fall  when  carried home 

      i see it not  nor hear adieu 





 574    separation 



    there is a mountain and a wood between us 

    where the lone shepherd and late bird have seen us

      morning and noon and eventide repass 

    between us now the mountain and the wood

    seem standing darker than last year they stood 

      and say we must not cross  alas  alas 





 575    late leaves 



    the leaves are falling  so am i 

    the few late flowers have moisture in the eye 

      so have i too 

    scarcely on any bough is heard

    joyous  or even unjoyous  bird

        the whole wood through 



    winter may come  he brings but nigher

    his circle  yearly narrowing  to the fire

        where old friends meet 

    let him  now heaven is overcast 

    and spring and summer both are past 

        and all things sweet 





 576    finis 



    i strove with none  for none was worth my strife 

    nature i loved and  next to nature  art 

    i warm’d both hands before the fire of life 

    it sinks  and i am ready to depart

 577    the old familiar faces 



    i have had playmates  i have had companions 

    in my days of childhood  in my joyful school days  

    all  all are gone  the old familiar faces 



    i have been laughing  i have been carousing 

    drinking late  sitting late  with my bosom cronies  

    all  all are gone  the old familiar faces 



    i loved a love once  fairest among women 

    closed are her doors on me  i must not see her  

    all  all are gone  the old familiar faces 



    i have a friend  a kinder friend has no man 

    like an ingrate  i left my friend abruptly 

    left him  to muse on the old familiar faces 



    ghost like i paced round the haunts of my childhood 

    earth seem’d a desert i was bound to traverse 

    seeking to find the old familiar faces 



    friend of my bosom  thou more than a brother 

    why wert not thou born in my father’s dwelling 

    so might we talk of the old familiar faces  



    how some they have died  and some they have left me 

    and some are taken from me  all are departed  

    all  all are gone  the old familiar faces 





 578    hester 



    when maidens such as hester die

    their place ye may not well supply 

    though ye among a thousand try

          with vain endeavour 



    a month or more hath she been dead 

    yet cannot i by force be led

    to think upon the wormy bed

          and her together 



    a springy motion in her gait 

    a rising step  did indicate

    of pride and joy no common rate 

          that flush’d her spirit 



    i know not by what name beside

    i shall it call  if ’twas not pride 

    it was a joy to that allied 

          she did inherit 



    her parents held the quaker rule 

    which doth the human feeling cool 

    but she was train’d in nature’s school 

          nature had blest her 



    a waking eye  a prying mind 

    a heart that stirs  is hard to bind 

    a hawk’s keen sight ye cannot blind 

          ye could not hester 



    my sprightly neighbour  gone before

    to that unknown and silent shore 

    shall we not meet  as heretofore 

          some summer morning  



    when from thy cheerful eyes a ray

    hath struck a bliss upon the day 

    a bliss that would not go away 

          a sweet forewarning 





 579    on an infant dying as soon as born 



    i saw where in the shroud did lurk

    a curious frame of nature’s work 

    a floweret crush’d in the bud 

    a nameless piece of babyhood 

    was in her cradle coffin lying 

    extinct  with scarce the sense of dying 

    so soon to exchange the imprisoning womb

    for darker closets of the tomb 

    she did but ope an eye  and put

    a clear beam forth  then straight up shut

    for the long dark  ne’er more to see

    through glasses of mortality 

      riddle of destiny  who can show

    what thy short visit meant  or know

    what thy errand here below 

    shall we say that nature blind

    check’d her hand  and changed her mind 

    just when she had exactly wrought

    a finish’d pattern without fault 

    could she flag  or could she tire 

    or lack’d she the promethean fire

     with her nine moons’ long workings sicken’d 

    that should thy little limbs have quicken’d 

    limbs so firm  they seem’d to assure

    life of health  and days mature 

    woman’s self in miniature 

    limbs so fair  they might supply

     themselves now but cold imagery 

    the sculptor to make beauty by 

    or did the stern eyed fate descry

    that babe or mother  one must die 

    so in mercy left the stock

    and cut the branch  to save the shock

    of young years widow’d  and the pain

    when single state comes back again

    to the lone man who  reft of wife 

    thenceforward drags a maimèd life 

    the economy of heaven is dark 

    and wisest clerks have miss’d the mark 

    why human buds  like this  should fall 

    more brief than fly ephemeral

    that has his day  while shrivell’d crones

    stiffen with age to stocks and stones 

    and crabbèd use the conscience sears

    in sinners of an hundred years 

      mother’s prattle  mother’s kiss 

    baby fond  thou ne’er wilt miss 

    rites  which custom does impose 

    silver bells  and baby clothes 

    coral redder than those lips

    which pale death did late eclipse 

    music framed for infants’ glee 

    whistle never tuned for thee 

    though thou want’st not  thou shalt have them 

    loving hearts were they which gave them 

    let not one be missing  nurse 

    see them laid upon the hearse

    of infant slain by doom perverse 

    why should kings and nobles have

    pictured trophies to their grave 

    and we  churls  to thee deny

    thy pretty toys with thee to lie  

    a more harmless vanity

 580    ye mariners of england 



    ye mariners of england

      that guard our native seas 

    whose flag has braved a thousand years

      the battle and the breeze 

    your glorious standard launch again

      to match another foe 

    and sweep through the deep 

      while the stormy winds do blow 

    while the battle rages loud and long

      and the stormy winds do blow 



    the spirits of your fathers

      shall start from every wave  

    for the deck it was their field of fame 

      and ocean was their grave 

    where blake and mighty nelson fell

      your manly hearts shall glow 

    as ye sweep through the deep 

      while the stormy winds do blow 

    while the battle rages loud and long

      and the stormy winds do blow 



    britannia needs no bulwarks 

      no towers along the steep 

    her march is o’er the mountain waves 

      her home is on the deep 

    with thunders from her native oak

      she quells the floods below 

    as they roar on the shore 

      when the stormy winds do blow 

    when the battle rages loud and long 

      and the stormy winds do blow 



    the meteor flag of england

      shall yet terrific burn 

    till danger’s troubled night depart

      and the star of peace return 

    then  then  ye ocean warriors 

      our song and feast shall flow

    to the fame of your name 

      when the storm has ceased to blow 

    when the fiery fight is heard no more 

      and the storm has ceased to blow 





 581    the battle of the baltic 



    of nelson and the north

    sing the glorious day’s renown 

    when to battle fierce came forth

    all the might of denmark s crown 

    and her arms along the deep proudly shone 

    by each gun the lighted brand

    in a bold determined hand 

    and the prince of all the land

    led them on 



    like leviathans afloat

    lay their bulwarks on the brine 

    while the sign of battle flew

    on the lofty british line 

    it was ten of april morn by the chime 

    as they drifted on their path

    there was silence deep as death 

    and the boldest held his breath

    for a time 



    but the might of england flush d

    to anticipate the scene 

    and her van the fleeter rush d

    o’er the deadly space between 

    ‘hearts of oak ’ our captains cried  when each gun

    from its adamantine lips

    spread a death shade round the ships 

    like the hurricane eclipse

    of the sun 



    again  again  again 

    and the havoc did not slack 

    till a feeble cheer the dane

    to our cheering sent us back   

    their shots along the deep slowly boom   

    then ceased  and all is wail 

    as they strike the shattered sail 

    or in conflagration pale

    light the gloom 



    out spoke the victor then

    as he hail d them o er the wave 

    ‘ye are brothers  ye are men 

    and we conquer but to save   



    so peace instead of death let us bring

    but yield  proud foe  thy fleet 

    with the crews  at england’s feet 

    and make submission meet

    to our king ’   



    now joy  old england  raise 

    for the tidings of thy might 

    by the festal cities’ blaze 

    whilst the wine cup shines in light 

    and yet amidst that joy and uproar 

    let us think of them that sleep

    full many a fathom deep 

    by thy wild and stormy steep 

    elsinore

    the young may moon is beaming  love 

    the glow worm’s lamp is gleaming  love 

            how sweet to rove

            through morna’s grove 

    when the drowsy world is dreaming  love 

    then awake   the heavens look bright  my dear 

    ’tis never too late for delight  my dear 

            and the best of all ways

            to lengthen our days

    is to steal a few hours from the night  my dear 



    now all the world is sleeping  love 

    but the sage  his star watch keeping  love 

            and i  whose star

            more glorious far

    is the eye from that casement peeping  love 

    then awake   till rise of sun  my dear 

    the sage’s glass we’ll shun  my dear 

            or in watching the flight

            of bodies of light

 583    the irish peasant to his mistress 



    through grief and through danger thy smile hath cheer’d my way 

    till hope seem’d to bud from each thorn that round me lay 

    the darker our fortune  the brighter our pure love burn’d 

    till shame into glory  till fear into zeal was turn’d 

    yes  slave as i was  in thy arms my spirit felt free 

    and bless’d even the sorrows that made me more dear to thee 



    thy rival was honour’d  while thou wert wrong’d and scorn’d 

    thy crown was of briers  while gold her brows adorn’d 

    she woo’d me to temples  whilst thou lay’st hid in caves 

    her friends were all masters  while thine  alas  were slaves 

    yet cold in the earth  at thy feet  i would rather be

    than wed what i loved not  or turn one thought from thee 



    they slander thee sorely  who say thy vows are frail  

    hadst thou been a false one  thy cheek had look’d less pale 

    they say  too  so long thou hast worn those lingering chains 

    that deep in thy heart they have printed their servile stains 

    o  foul is the slander   no chain could that soul subdue  

    where shineth thy spirit  there liberty shineth too 





 584    the light of other days 



    oft  in the stilly night

    fond memory brings the light

      of other days around me 

        the smiles  the tears

        of boyhood’s years 

      the words of love then spoken 

        the eyes that shone 

        now dimm’d and gone 

      the cheerful hearts now broken 

    thus  in the stilly night 

      ere slumber’s chain has bound me 

    sad memory brings the light

      of other days around me 



    when i remember all

      the friends  so link’d together 

    i’ve seen around me fall

      like leaves in wintry weather 

        i feel like one

        who treads alone

      some banquet hall deserted 

        whose lights are fled 

        whose garlands dead 

      and all but he departed 

    thus  in the stilly night 

      ere slumber’s chain has bound me 

    sad memory brings the light

      of other days around me 





 585    at the mid hour of night 



    at the mid hour of night  when stars are weeping  i fly

    to the lone vale we loved  when life shone warm in thine eye 

      and i think oft  if spirits can steal from the regions of air

      to revisit past scenes of delight  thou wilt come to me there 

    and tell me our love is remembered even in the sky 



    then i sing the wild song it once was rapture to hear 

    when our voices commingling breathed like one on the ear 

      and as echo far off through the vale my sad orison rolls 

      i think  o my love  ’tis thy voice from the kingdom of souls

    faintly answering still the notes that once were so dear

      or pipe or wire 

    thou hast the golden bee

      ripen’d with fire 

    and many thousand more

    songsters  that thee adore 

    filling earth’s grassy floor

      with new desire 



    thou hast thy mighty herds 

      tame and free livers 

    doubt not  thy music too

      in the deep rivers 

    and the whole plumy flight

    warbling the day and night  

    up at the gates of light 

      see  the lark quivers

 587    battle song 



    day  like our souls  is fiercely dark 

            what then  ’tis day 

    we sleep no more  the cock crows  hark 

            to arms  away 

    they come  they come  the knell is rung

            of us or them 

    wide o’er their march the pomp is flung

            of gold and gem 

    what collar’d hound of lawless sway 

            to famine dear  

    what pensioned slave of attila 

            leads in the rear 

    come they from scythian wilds afar 

            our blood to spill 

    wear they the livery of the czar 

            they do his will 

    nor tassell’d silk  nor epaulet 

              nor plume  nor torse  

    no splendour gilds  all sternly met 

              our foot and horse 

    but  dark and still  we inly glow 

              condensed in ire 

    strike  tawdry slaves  and ye shall know

              our gloom is fire 

    in vain your pomp  ye evil powers 

              insults the land 

    wrongs  vengeance  and the cause are ours 

              and god’s right hand 

    madmen  they trample into snakes

              the wormy clod 

    like fire  beneath their feet awakes

              the sword of god 

    behind  before  above  below 

              they rouse the brave 

    where’er they go  they make a foe 

              or find a grave 





 588    plaint 



    dark  deep  and cold the current flows

    unto the sea where no wind blows 

    seeking the land which no one knows 



    o’er its sad gloom still comes and goes

    the mingled wail of friends and foes 

    borne to the land which no one knows 



    why shrieks for help yon wretch  who goes

    with millions  from a world of woes 

    unto the land which no one knows 



    though myriads go with him who goes 

    alone he goes where no wind blows 

    unto the land which no one knows 



    for all must go where no wind blows 

    and none can go for him who goes 

    none  none return whence no one knows 



    yet why should he who shrieking goes

    with millions  from a world of woes 

    reunion seek with it or those 



    alone with god  where no wind blows 

    and death  his shadow  doom’d  he goes 

    that god is there the shadow shows 



    o shoreless deep  where no wind blows 

    and thou  o land which no one knows 

    that god is all  his shadow shows

 593    love and age 



    i play’d with you ’mid cowslips blowing 

      when i was six and you were four 

    when garlands weaving  flower balls throwing 

      were pleasures soon to please no more 

    through groves and meads  o’er grass and heather 

      with little playmates  to and fro 

    we wander’d hand in hand together 

      but that was sixty years ago 



    you grew a lovely roseate maiden 

      and still our early love was strong 

    still with no care our days were laden 

      they glided joyously along 

    and i did love you very dearly 

      how dearly words want power to show 

    i thought your heart was touch’d as nearly 

      but that was fifty years ago 



    then other lovers came around you 

      your beauty grew from year to year 

    and many a splendid circle found you

      the centre of its glittering sphere 

    i saw you then  first vows forsaking 

      on rank and wealth your hand bestow 

    o  then i thought my heart was breaking   

      but that was forty years ago 



    and i lived on  to wed another 

      no cause she gave me to repine 

    and when i heard you were a mother 

      i did not wish the children mine 

    my own young flock  in fair progression 

      made up a pleasant christmas row 

    my joy in them was past expression 

      but that was thirty years ago 



    you grew a matron plump and comely 

      you dwelt in fashion’s brightest blaze 

    my earthly lot was far more homely 

      but i too had my festal days 

    no merrier eyes have ever glisten’d

      around the hearth stone’s wintry glow 

    than when my youngest child was christen’d 

      but that was twenty years ago 



    time pass’d  my eldest girl was married 

      and i am now a grandsire gray 

    one pet of four years old i’ve carried

      among the wild flower’d meads to play 

    in our old fields of childish pleasure 

      where now  as then  the cowslips blow 

    she fills her basket’s ample measure 

      and that is not ten years ago 



    but though first love’s impassion’d blindness

      has pass’d away in colder light 

    i still have thought of you with kindness 

      and shall do  till our last good night 

    the ever rolling silent hours

      will bring a time we shall not know 

    when our young days of gathering flowers

      will be an hundred years ago 





 594    the grave of love 



    i dug  beneath the cypress shade 

      what well might seem an elfin’s grave 

    and every pledge in earth i laid 

      that erst thy false affection gave 



    i press’d them down the sod beneath 

      i placed one mossy stone above 

    and twined the rose’s fading wreath

      around the sepulchre of love 



    frail as thy love  the flowers were dead

      ere yet the evening sun was set 

    but years shall see the cypress spread 

      immutable as my regret

    the bowl goes trim  the moon doth shine 

    and our ballast is old wine   

    and your ballast is old wine 



    who art thou  so fast adrift 

    i am he they call old care 

    here on board we will thee lift 

    no  i may not enter there 

    wherefore so  ’tis jove’s decree 

    in a bowl care may not be   

    in a bowl care may not be 



    fear ye not the waves that roll 

    no  in charmèd bowl we swim 

    what the charm that floats the bowl 

    water may not pass the brim 

    the bowl goes trim  the moon doth shine 

    and our ballast is old wine   

    and your ballast is old wine

 596    to death 



    come not in terrors clad  to claim

        an unresisting prey 

    come like an evening shadow  death 

      so stealthily  so silently 

    and shut mine eyes  and steal my breath 

      then willingly  o willingly 

        with thee i’ll go away 



    what need to clutch with iron grasp

        what gentlest touch may take 

    what need with aspect dark to scare 

      so awfully  so terribly 

    the weary soul would hardly care 

      call’d quietly  call’d tenderly 

        from thy dread power to break 



    ’tis not as when thou markest out

        the young  the blest  the gay 

    the loved  the loving  they who dream

      so happily  so hopefully 

    then harsh thy kindest call may seem 

      and shrinkingly  reluctantly 

        the summon’d may obey 





    but i have drunk enough of life  

        the cup assign’d to me

    dash’d with a little sweet at best 

      so scantily  so scantily  

    to know full well that all the rest

      more bitterly  more bitterly 

        drugg’d to the last will be 



    and i may live to pain some heart

        that kindly cares for me 

    to pain  but not to bless  o death 

      come quietly  come lovingly  

    and shut mine eyes  and steal my breath 

      then willingly  o willingly 

        i’ll go away with thee

 597    when we two parted 



    when we two parted

      in silence and tears 

    half broken hearted

      to sever for years 

    pale grew thy cheek and cold 

      colder thy kiss 

    truly that hour foretold

      sorrow to this 



    the dew of the morning

      sunk chill on my brow  

    it felt like the warning

      of what i feel now 

    thy vows are all broken 

      and light is thy fame 

    i hear thy name spoken 

      and share in its shame 



    they name thee before me 

      a knell to mine ear 

    a shudder comes o’er me  

      why wert thou so dear 

    they know not i knew thee 

      who knew thee too well 

    long  long shall i rue thee 

      too deeply to tell 



    in secret we met  

      in silence i grieve 

    that thy heart could forget 

      thy spirit deceive 

    if i should meet thee

      after long years 

    how should i greet thee 

      with silence and tears 





 598    for music 



    there be none of beauty’s daughters

      with a magic like thee 

    and like music on the waters

      is thy sweet voice to me 

    when  as if its sound were causing

    the charmèd ocean’s pausing 

    the waves lie still and gleaming 

    and the lull’d winds seem dreaming 



    and the midnight moon is weaving

      her bright chain o’er the deep 

    whose breast is gently heaving 

      as an infant’s asleep 

    so the spirit bows before thee 

    to listen and adore thee 

    with a full but soft emotion 

    like the swell of summer’s ocean 





 599    we’ll go no more a roving 



    so  we’ll go no more a roving

      so late into the night 

    though the heart be still as loving 

      and the moon be still as bright 



    for the sword outwears its sheath 

      and the soul wears out the breast 

    and the heart must pause to breathe 

      and love itself have rest 



    though the night was made for loving 

      and the day returns too soon 

    yet we’ll go no more a roving

      by the light of the moon 





 600    she walks in beauty 



    she walks in beauty  like the night

      of cloudless climes and starry skies 

    and all that’s best of dark and bright

      meet in her aspect and her eyes 

    thus mellow’d to that tender light

      which heaven to gaudy day denies 



    one shade the more  one ray the less 

      had half impair’d the nameless grace

    which waves in every raven tress 

      or softly lightens o’er her face 

    where thoughts serenely sweet express

      how pure  how dear their dwelling place 



    and on that cheek  and o’er that brow 

      so soft  so calm  yet eloquent 

    the smiles that win  the tints that glow 

      but tell of days in goodness spent 

    a mind at peace with all below 

      a heart whose love is innocent 





 601    the isles of greece 



    the isles of greece  the isles of greece

      where burning sappho loved and sung 

    where grew the arts of war and peace 

      where delos rose  and phœbus sprung 

    eternal summer gilds them yet 

    but all  except their sun  is set 



    the scian and the teian muse 

      the hero’s harp  the lover’s lute 

    have found the fame your shores refuse 

      their place of birth alone is mute

    to sounds which echo further west

    than your sires’ ‘islands of the blest ’



    the mountains look on marathon  

      and marathon looks on the sea 

    and musing there an hour alone 

      i dream’d that greece might still be free 

    for standing on the persians’ grave 

    i could not deem myself a slave 



    a king sate on the rocky brow

      which looks o’er sea born salamis 

    and ships  by thousands  lay below 

      and men in nations   all were his 

    he counted them at break of day  

    and when the sun set  where were they 



    and where are they  and where art thou 

      my country  on thy voiceless shore

    the heroic lay is tuneless now  

      the heroic bosom beats no more 

    and must thy lyre  so long divine 

    degenerate into hands like mine 



    ’tis something in the dearth of fame 

      though link’d among a fetter’d race 

    to feel at least a patriot’s shame 

      even as i sing  suffuse my face 

    for what is left the poet here 

    for greeks a blush  for greece a tear 



    must  we  but weep o’er days more blest 

      must  we  but blush   our fathers bled 

    earth  render back from out thy breast

      a remnant of our spartan dead 

    of the three hundred grant but three 

    to make a new thermopylæ 



    what  silent still  and silent all 

      ah  no   the voices of the dead

    sound like a distant torrent’s fall 

      and answer  ‘let one living head 

    but one  arise   we come  we come ’

    ’tis but the living who are dumb 



    in vain  in vain  strike other chords 

      fill high the cup with samian wine 

    leave battles to the turkish hordes 

      and shed the blood of scio’s vine 

    hark  rising to the ignoble call  

    how answers each bold bacchanal 



    you have the pyrrhic dance as yet 

      where is the pyrrhic phalanx gone 

    of two such lessons  why forget

      the nobler and the manlier one 

    you have the letters cadmus gave  

    think ye he meant them for a slave 



    fill high the bowl with samian wine 

      we will not think of themes like these 

    it made anacreon’s song divine 

      he served  but served polycrates  

    a tyrant  but our masters then

    were still  at least  our countrymen 



    the tyrant of the chersonese

      was freedom’s best and bravest friend 

     that  tyrant was miltiades 

      o that the present hour would lend

    another despot of the kind 

    such chains as his were sure to bind 



    fill high the bowl with samian wine 

      on suli’s rock  and parga’s shore 

    exists the remnant of a line

      such as the doric mothers bore 

    and there  perhaps  some seed is sown 

    the heracleidan blood might own 



    trust not for freedom to the franks  

      they have a king who buys and sells 

    in native swords and native ranks

      the only hope of courage dwells 

    but turkish force and latin fraud

    would break your shield  however broad 



    fill high the bowl with samian wine 

      our virgins dance beneath the shade  

    i see their glorious black eyes shine 

      but gazing on each glowing maid 

    my own the burning tear drop laves 

    to think such breasts must suckle slaves 



    place me on sunium’s marbled steep 

      where nothing  save the waves and i 

    may hear our mutual murmurs sweep 

      there  swan like  let me sing and die 

    a land of slaves shall ne’er be mine  

    dash down yon cup of samian wine

 602    the children band 



    all holy influences dwell within

      the breast of childhood  instincts fresh from god

      inspire it  ere the heart beneath the rod

    of grief hath bled  or caught the plague of sin 

    how mighty was that fervour which could win

      its way to infant souls   and was the sod

      of palestine by infant croises trod 

    like joseph went they forth  or benjamin 

    in all their touching beauty to redeem 

      and did their soft lips kiss the sepulchre 

    alas  the lovely pageant as a dream

      faded  they sank not through ignoble fear 

    they felt not moslem steel  by mountain  stream 

    in sands  in fens  they died  no mother near

 603    the burial of sir john moore after corunna 



    not a drum was heard  not a funeral note 

      as his corse to the rampart we hurried 

    not a soldier discharged his farewell shot

      o’er the grave where our hero we buried 



    we buried him darkly at dead of night 

      the sods with our bayonets turning 

    by the struggling moonbeam’s misty light

      and the lanthorn dimly burning 



    no useless coffin enclosed his breast 

      not in sheet or in shroud we wound him 

    but he lay like a warrior taking his rest

      with his martial cloak around him 



    few and short were the prayers we said 

      and we spoke not a word of sorrow 

    but we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead 

      and we bitterly thought of the morrow 



    we thought  as we hollow’d his narrow bed

      and smoothed down his lonely pillow 

    that the foe and the stranger would tread o’er his head 

      and we far away on the billow 



    lightly they’ll talk of the spirit that’s gone 

      and o’er his cold ashes upbraid him  

    but little he’ll reck  if they let him sleep on

      in the grave where a briton has laid him 



    but half of our heavy task was done

      when the clock struck the hour for retiring 

    and we heard the distant and random gun

      that the foe was sullenly firing 



    slowly and sadly we laid him down 

      from the field of his fame fresh and gory 

    we carved not a line  and we raised not a stone 

      but we left him alone with his glory 





 604    to mary 



    if i had thought thou couldst have died 

        i might not weep for thee 

    but i forgot  when by thy side 

        that thou couldst mortal be 

    it never through my mind had past

        the time would e’er be o’er 

    and i on thee should look my last 

        and thou shouldst smile no more 



    and still upon that face i look 

        and think ’twill smile again 

    and still the thought i will not brook 

        that i must look in vain 

    but when i speak  thou dost not say

        what thou ne’er left’st unsaid 

    and now i feel  as well i may 

        sweet mary  thou art dead 



    if thou wouldst stay  e’en as thou art 

        all cold and all serene  

    i still might press thy silent heart 

        and where thy smiles have been 

    while e’en thy chill  bleak corse i have 

        thou seemest still mine own 

    but there  i lay thee in thy grave 

        and i am now alone 



    i do not think  where’er thou art 

        thou hast forgotten me 

    and i  perhaps  may soothe this heart

        in thinking too of thee 

    yet there was round thee such a dawn

        of light ne’er seen before 

    as fancy never could have drawn 

        and never can restore

 605    hymn of pan 



      from the forests and highlands

        we come  we come 

      from the river girt islands 

        where loud waves are dumb 

    listening to my sweet pipings 

      the wind in the reeds and the rushes 

        the bees on the bells of thyme 

      the birds on the myrtle bushes 

        the cicale above in the lime 

    and the lizards below in the grass 

    were as silent as ever old tmolus was 

      listening to my sweet pipings 



      liquid peneus was flowing 

        and all dark tempe lay

      in pelion’s shadow  outgrowing

        the light of the dying day 

      speeded by my sweet pipings 

        the sileni and sylvans and fauns 

          and the nymphs of the woods and waves 

        to the edge of the moist river lawns 

          and the brink of the dewy caves 

    and all that did then attend and follow 

    were silent with love  as you now  apollo 

      with envy of my sweet pipings 



      i sang of the dancing stars 

        i sang of the dædal earth 

      and of heaven  and the giant wars 

        and love  and death  and birth 

      and then i changed my pipings  

        singing how down the vale of mænalus

          i pursued a maiden  and clasp’d a reed 

        gods and men  we are all deluded thus 

          it breaks in our bosom  and then we bleed 

    all wept  as i think both ye now would 

    if envy or age had not frozen your blood  

      at the sorrow of my sweet pipings 





 606    the invitation 



    best and brightest  come away 

    fairer far than this fair day 

    which  like thee to those in sorrow 

    comes to bid a sweet good morrow

    to the rough year just awake

    in its cradle on the brake 

    the brightest hour of unborn spring 

    through the winter wandering 

    found  it seems  the halcyon morn

    to hoar february born 

    bending from heaven  in azure mirth 

    it kiss’d the forehead of the earth 

    and smiled upon the silent sea 

    and bade the frozen streams be free 

    and waked to music all their fountains 

    and breathed upon the frozen mountains 

    and like a prophetess of may

    strew’d flowers upon the barren way 

    making the wintry world appear

    like one on whom thou smilest  dear 



    away  away  from men and towns 

    to the wild wood and the downs  

    to the silent wilderness

    where the soul need not repress

    its music lest it should not find

    an echo in another’s mind 

    while the touch of nature’s art

    harmonizes heart to heart 

    i leave this notice on my door

    for each accustomed visitor   

    ‘i am gone into the fields

    to take what this sweet hour yields 

    reflection  you may come to morrow 

    sit by the fireside with sorrow 

    you with the unpaid bill  despair   

    you tiresome verse reciter  care   

    i will pay you in the grave   

    death will listen to your stave 

    expectation too  be off 

    to day is for itself enough 

    hope  in pity  mock not woe

    with smiles  nor follow where i go 

    long having lived on your sweet food 

    at length i find one moment’s good

    after long pain  with all your love 

    this you never told me of ’



    radiant sister of the day 

    awake  arise  and come away 

    to the wild woods and the plains 

    and the pools where winter rains

    image all their roof of leaves 

    where the pine its garland weaves

    of sapless green and ivy dun

    round stems that never kiss the sun 

    where the lawns and pastures be 

    and the sandhills of the sea 

    when the melting hoar frost wets

    the daisy star that never sets 

    and wind flowers  and violets

    which yet join not scent to hue 

    crown the pale year weak and new 

    when the night is left behind

    in the deep east  dun and blind 

    and the blue noon is over us 

    and the multitudinous

    billows murmur at our feet

    where the earth and ocean meet 

    and all things seem only one

    in the universal sun 





 607    hellas 



    the world’s great age begins anew 

      the golden years return 

    the earth doth like a snake renew

      her winter weeds outworn 

    heaven smiles  and faiths and empires gleam

    like wrecks of a dissolving dream 



    a brighter hellas rears its mountains

      from waves serener far 

    a new peneus rolls his fountains

      against the morning star 

    where fairer tempes bloom  there sleep

    young cyclads on a sunnier deep 



    a loftier argo cleaves the main 

      fraught with a later prize 

    another orpheus sings again 

      and loves  and weeps  and dies 

    a new ulysses leaves once more

    calypso for his native shore 



    o write no more the tale of troy 

      if earth death’s scroll must be  

    nor mix with laian rage the joy

      which dawns upon the free 

    although a subtler sphinx renew

    riddles of death thebes never knew 



    another athens shall arise 

      and to remoter time

    bequeath  like sunset to the skies 

      the splendour of its prime 

    and leave  if naught so bright may live 

    all earth can take or heaven can give 



    saturn and love their long repose

      shall burst  more bright and good

    than all who fell  than one who rose 

      than many unsubdued 

    not gold  not blood  their altar dowers 

    but votive tears and symbol flowers 



    o cease  must hate and death return 

      cease  must men kill and die 

    cease  drain not to its dregs the urn

      of bitter prophecy 

    the world is weary of the past  

    o might it die or rest at last 





 608    to a skylark 



          hail to thee  blithe spirit 

            bird thou never wert  

          that from heaven or near it

            pourest thy full heart

    in profuse strains of unpremeditated art 



          higher still and higher

            from the earth thou springest 

          like a cloud of fire 

            the blue deep thou wingest 

    and singing still dost soar  and soaring ever singest 



          in the golden light’ning

            of the sunken sun 

          o’er which clouds are bright’ning 

            thou dost float and run 

    like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun 



          the pale purple even

            melts around thy flight 

          like a star of heaven 

            in the broad daylight

    thou art unseen  but yet i hear thy shrill delight  



          keen as are the arrows

            of that silver sphere

          whose intense lamp narrows

            in the white dawn clear 

    until we hardly see  we feel that it is there 



          all the earth and air

            with thy voice is loud 

          as  when night is bare 

            from one lonely cloud

    the moon rains out her beams  and heaven is overflow’d 



          what thou art we know not 

            what is most like thee 

          from rainbow clouds there flow not

            drops so bright to see 

    as from thy presence showers a rain of melody   





          like a poet hidden

            in the light of thought 

          singing hymns unbidden 

            till the world is wrought

    to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not 



          like a high born maiden

            in a palace tower 

          soothing her love laden

            soul in secret hour

    with music sweet as love  which overflows her bower 



          like a glow worm golden

            in a dell of dew 

          scattering unbeholden

            its aërial hue

    among the flowers and grass which screen it from the view 



          like a rose embower’d

            in its own green leaves 

          by warm winds deflower’d 

            till the scent it gives

    makes faint with too much sweet these heavy wingèd thieves



          sound of vernal showers

            on the twinkling grass 

          rain awaken’d flowers  

            all that ever was

    joyous and clear and fresh  thy music doth surpass 



          teach us  sprite or bird 

            what sweet thoughts are thine 

          i have never heard

            praise of love or wine

    that panted forth a flood of rapture so divine 





          chorus hymeneal 

            or triumphal chant 

          match’d with thine would be all

            but an empty vaunt  

    a thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want 



          what objects are the fountains

            of thy happy strain 

          what fields  or waves  or mountains 

            what shapes of sky or plain 

    what love of thine own kind  what ignorance of pain 



          with thy clear keen joyance

            languor cannot be 

          shadow of annoyance

            never came near thee 

    thou lovest  but ne’er knew love’s sad satiety 



          waking or asleep 

            thou of death must deem

          things more true and deep

            than we mortals dream 

    or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream 



          we look before and after 

            and pine for what is not 

          our sincerest laughter

            with some pain is fraught 

    our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought 



          yet  if we could scorn

            hate and pride and fear 

          if we were things born

            not to shed a tear 

    i know not how thy joy we ever should come near 





          better than all measures

            of delightful sound 

          better than all treasures

            that in books are found 

    thy skill to poet were  thou scorner of the ground 



          teach me half the gladness

            that thy brain must know 

          such harmonious madness

            from my lips would flow 

    the world should listen then  as i am listening now 





 609    the moon 



i



    and  like a dying lady lean and pale 

      who totters forth  wrapp’d in a gauzy veil 

    out of her chamber  led by the insane

    and feeble wanderings of her fading brain 

    the moon arose up in the murky east

    a white and shapeless mass 



ii



        art thou pale for weariness

    of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth 

        wandering companionless

    among the stars that have a different birth 

    and ever changing  like a joyless eye

    that finds no object worth its constancy 





 610    ode to the west wind 





i



    o wild west wind  thou breath of autumn’s being

      thou from whose unseen presence the leaves dead

    are driven like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing 



      yellow  and black  and pale  and hectic red 

    pestilence stricken multitudes  o thou

      who chariotest to their dark wintry bed



    the wingèd seeds  where they lie cold and low 

      each like a corpse within its grave  until

    thine azure sister of the spring shall blow



      her clarion o’er the dreaming earth  and fill

     driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air 

      with living hues and odours plain and hill 



    wild spirit  which art moving everywhere 

    destroyer and preserver  hear  o hear 





ii



    thou on whose stream  ’mid the steep sky’s commotion 

      loose clouds like earth’s decaying leaves are shed 

    shook from the ‘tangled boughs of heaven and ocean 



      angels of rain and lightning  there are spread

    on the blue surface of thine airy surge 

      like the bright hair uplifted from the head



    of some fierce mænad  even from the dim verge

      of the horizon to the zenith’s height 

    the locks of the approaching storm  thou dirge

      of the dying year  to which this closing night

    will be the dome of a vast sepulchre 

      vaulted with all thy congregated might



    of vapours  from whose solid atmosphere

    black rain  and fire  and hail  will burst  o hear 





iii



    thou who didst waken from his summer dreams

      the blue mediterranean  where he lay 

    lull’d by the coil of his crystàlline streams 



      beside a pumice isle in baiæ’s bay 

    and saw in sleep old palaces and towers

      quivering within the wave’s intenser day 



    all overgrown with azure moss  and flowers

      so sweet  the sense faints picturing them  thou

    for whose path the atlantic’s level powers



      cleave themselves into chasms  while far below

    the sea blooms and the oozy woods which wear

      the sapless foliage of the ocean  know



    thy voice  and suddenly grow gray with fear 

    and tremble and despoil themselves  o hear 





iv



    if i were a dead leaf thou mightest bear 

      if i were a swift cloud to fly with thee 

    a wave to pant beneath thy power  and share

      the impulse of thy strength  only less free

    than thou  o uncontrollable  if even

      i were as in my boyhood  and could be



    the comrade of thy wanderings over heaven 

      as then  when to outstrip thy skiey speed

    scarce seem’d a vision  i would ne’er have striven



      as thus with thee in prayer in my sore need 

    o  lift me as a wave  a leaf  a cloud 

      i fall upon the thorns of life  i bleed 



    a heavy weight of hours has chained and bow’d

    one too like thee  tameless  and swift  and proud 





v



    make me thy lyre  even as the forest is 

      what if my leaves are falling like its own 

    the tumult of thy mighty harmonies



      will take from both a deep autumnal tone 

    sweet though in sadness  be thou  spirit fierce 

      my spirit  be thou me  impetuous one 



    drive my dead thoughts over the universe 

      like wither’d leaves  to quicken a new birth 

    and  by the incantation of this verse 



      scatter  as from an unextinguish’d hearth

    ashes and sparks  my words among mankind 

      be through my lips to unawaken’d earth



    the trumpet of a prophecy  o wind 

    if winter comes  can spring be far behind 





 611    the indian serenade 



    i arise from dreams of thee

      in the first sweet sleep of night 

    when the winds are breathing low 

      and the stars are shining bright 

    i arise from dreams of thee 

      and a spirit in my feet

    hath led me  who knows how 

      to thy chamber window  sweet 



    the wandering airs they faint

      on the dark  the silent stream  

    and the champak’s odours  pine 

      like sweet thoughts in a dream 

    the nightingale’s complaint 

      it dies upon her heart 

    as i must on thine 

      o belovèd as thou art 



    o lift me from the grass 

      i die  i faint  i fail 

    let thy love in kisses rain

      on my lips and eyelids pale 

    my cheek is cold and white  alas 

      my heart beats loud and fast 

    o press it to thine own again 

      where it will break at last 





 612    night 



    swiftly walk over the western wave 

              spirit of night 

    out of the misty eastern cave   

    where  all the long and lone daylight 

    thou wovest dreams of joy and fear

    which make thee terrible and dear   

              swift be thy flight 



    wrap thy form in a mantle grey 

              star inwrought 

    blind with thine hair the eyes of day 

    kiss her until she be wearied out 

    then wander o’er city and sea and land 

    touching all with thine opiate wand  

              come  long sought 



    when i arose and saw the dawn 

              i sigh’d for thee 

    when light rode high  and the dew was gone 

    and noon lay heavy on flower and tree 

    and the weary day turn’d to her rest 

    lingering like an unloved guest 

              i sigh’d for thee 



    thy brother death came  and cried 

              ‘wouldst thou me ’

    thy sweet child sleep  the filmy eyed 

    murmur’d like a noontide bee 

    ‘shall i nestle near thy side 

    wouldst thou me ’  and i replied 

              ‘no  not thee ’



    death will come when thou art dead 

              soon  too soon  

    sleep will come when thou art fled 

    of neither would i ask the boon

    i ask of thee  belovèd night  

    swift be thine approaching flight 

              come soon  soon 





 613    from the arabic 



an imitation



    my faint spirit was sitting in the light

              of thy looks  my love 

      it panted for thee like the hind at noon

              for the brooks  my love 

    thy barb  whose hoofs outspeed the tempest’s flight 

              bore thee far from me 

      my heart  for my weak feet were weary soon 

              did companion thee 



    ah  fleeter far than fleetest storm or steed 

              or the death they bear 

      the heart which tender thought clothes like a dove

              with the wings of care 

    in the battle  in the darkness  in the need 

              shall mine cling to thee 

      nor claim one smile for all the comfort  love 

              it may bring to thee 





 614    lines 



      when the lamp is shatter’d 

    the light in the dust lies dead 

      when the cloud is scatter’d 

    the rainbow’s glory is shed 

      when the lute is broken 

    sweet tones are remember’d not

      when the lips have spoken 

    loved accents are soon forgot 



      as music and splendour

    survive not the lamp and the lute 

      the heart’s echoes render

    no song when the spirit is mute  

      no song but sad dirges 

    like the wind through a ruin’d cell 

      or the mournful surges

    that ring the dead seaman’s knell 



      when hearts have once mingled 

    love first leaves the well built nest 

      the weak one is singled

    to endure what it once possest 

      o love  who bewailest

    the frailty of all things here 

      why choose you the frailest

    for your cradle  your home  and your bier 



      its passions will rock thee 

    as the storms rock the ravens on high 

      bright reason will mock thee 

    like the sun from a wintry sky 

      from thy nest every rafter

    will rot  and thine eagle home

      leave thee naked to laughter 

    when leaves fall and cold winds come 





 615    to      



    one word is too often profaned

      for me to profane it 

    one feeling too falsely disdain’d

      for thee to disdain it 

    one hope is too like despair

      for prudence to smother 

    and pity from thee more dear

      than that from another 





    i can give not what men call love 

      but wilt thou accept not

    the worship the heart lifts above

      and the heavens reject not 

    the desire of the moth for the star 

      of the night for the morrow 

    the devotion to something afar

      from the sphere of our sorrow 





 616    the question 



    i dream’d that  as i wander’d by the way 

      bare winter suddenly was changed to spring 

    and gentle odours led my steps astray 

      mix’d with a sound of waters murmuring

    along a shelving bank of turf  which lay

      under a copse  and hardly dared to fling

    its green arms round the bosom of the stream 

    but kiss’d it and then fled  as thou mightest in dream 



    there grew pied wind flowers and violets 

      daisies  those pearl’d arcturi of the earth 

    the constellated flower that never sets 

      faint oxlips  tender bluebells  at whose birth

    the sod scarce heaved  and that tall flower that wets  

      like a child  half in tenderness and mirth  

    its mother’s face with heaven collected tears

    when the low wind  its playmate’s voice  it hears 



    and in the warm hedge grew lush eglantine 

      green cowbind and the moonlight colour’d may 

    and cherry blossoms  and white cups whose wine

      was the bright dew yet drain’d not by the day 

    and wild roses  and ivy serpentine 

      with its dark buds and leaves wandering astray 

    and flowers  azure  black  and streak’d with gold 

    fairer than any waken’d eyes behold 



    and nearer to the river’s trembling edge

      there grew broad flag flowers  purple prank’d with white 

    and starry river buds among the sedge 

      and floating water lilies  broad and bright 

    which lit the oak that overhung the hedge

      with moonlight beams of their own watery light 

    and bulrushes  and reeds of such deep green

    as soothed the dazzled eye with sober sheen 



    methought that of these visionary flowers

      i made a nosegay  bound in such a way

    that the same hues which in their natural bowers

      were mingled or opposed  the like array

    kept these imprison’d children of the hours

      within my hand   and then  elate and gay 

    i hasten’d to the spot whence i had come 

    that i might there present it  o  to whom 





 617    remorse 



    away  the moor is dark beneath the moon 

      rapid clouds have drunk the last pale beam of even 

    away  the gathering winds will call the darkness soon 

      and profoundest midnight shroud the serene lights of heaven 



    pause not  the time is past  every voice cries ‘away ’

      tempt not with one last tear thy friend’s ungentle mood 

    thy lover’s eye  so glazed and cold  dares not entreat thy stay 

      duty and dereliction guide thee back to solitude 



    away  away  to thy sad and silent home 

      pour bitter tears on its desolated hearth 

    watch the dim shades as like ghosts they go and come 

      and complicate strange webs of melancholy mirth 

    the leaves of wasted autumn woods shall float around thine head 

      the blooms of dewy spring shall gleam beneath thy feet 

    but thy soul or this world must fade in the frost that binds the dead 

      ere midnight’s frown and morning’s smile  ere thou and peace  may meet 



    the cloud shadows of midnight possess their own repose 

      for the weary winds are silent  or the moon is in the deep 

    some respite to its turbulence unresting ocean knows 

      whatever moves or toils or grieves hath its appointed sleep 

    thou in the grave shalt rest   yet  till the phantoms flee 

      which that house and heath and garden made dear to thee erewhile 

    thy remembrance and repentance and deep musings are not free

      from the music of two voices  and the light of one sweet smile 





 618    music  when soft voices die 



    music  when soft voices die 

    vibrates in the memory 

    odours  when sweet violets sicken 

    live within the sense they quicken 



    rose leaves  when the rose is dead 

    are heap’d for the belovèd’s bed 

    and so thy thoughts  when thou art gone 

    love itself shall slumber on

 620    burial of the dead 



    i thought to meet no more  so dreary seem’d

    death’s interposing veil  and thou so pure 

              thy place in paradise

              beyond where i could soar 



    friend of this worthless heart  but happier thoughts

    spring like unbidden violets from the sod 

              where patiently thou tak’st

              thy sweet and sure repose 



    the shadows fall more soothing  the soft air

    is full of cheering whispers like thine own 

              while memory  by thy grave 

              lives o’er thy funeral day 



    the deep knell dying down  the mourners’ pause 

    waiting their saviour’s welcome at the gate   

              sure with the words of heaven

              thy spirit met us there 



    and sought with us along th’ accustom’d way

    the hallow’d porch  and entering in  beheld

              the pageant of sad joy

              so dear to faith and hope 



    o  hadst thou brought a strain from paradise

    to cheer us  happy soul  thou hadst not touch’d

              the sacred springs of grief

              more tenderly and true 

    than those deep warbled anthems  high and low 

    low as the grave  high as th’ eternal throne 

              guiding through light and gloom

              our mourning fancies wild 



    till gently  like soft golden clouds at eve

    around the western twilight  all subside

              into a placid faith 

              that even with beaming eye



    counts thy sad honours  coffin  bier  and pall 

    so many relics of a frail love lost 

              so many tokens dear

              of endless love begun 



    listen  it is no dream  th’ apostles’ trump

    gives earnest of th’ archangel’s   calmly now 

              our hearts yet beating high

              to that victorious lay



     most like a warrior’s  to the martial dirge

    of a true comrade   in the grave we trust

              our treasure for awhile 

              and if a tear steal down 



    if human anguish o’er the shaded brow

    pass shuddering  when the handful of pure earth

              touches the coffin lid 

              if at our brother’s name 



    once and again the thought  ‘for ever gone ’

    come o’er us like a cloud  yet  gentle spright 

              thou turnest not away 

              thou know’st us calm at heart 



    one look  and we have seen our last of thee 

    till we too sleep and our long sleep be o’er 

              o cleanse us  ere we view

              that countenance pure again 



    thou  who canst change the heart  and raise the dead 

    as thou art by to soothe our parting hour 

              be ready when we meet 

              with thy dear pardoning words

 621    written in northampton county asylum 



    i am  yet what i am who cares  or knows 

      my friends forsake me like a memory lost 

    i am the self consumer of my woes 

      they rise and vanish  an oblivious host 

    shadows of life  whose very soul is lost 

    and yet i am  i live  though i am toss’d



    into the nothingness of scorn and noise 

      into the living sea of waking dream 

    where there is neither sense of life  nor joys 

      but the huge shipwreck of my own esteem

    and all that’s dear  even those i loved the best

    are strange  nay  they are stranger than the rest 



    i long for scenes where man has never trod  

      for scenes where woman never smiled or wept  

    there to abide with my creator  god 

      and sleep as i in childhood sweetly slept 

    full of high thoughts  unborn  so let me lie   

    the grass below  above  the vaulted sky

 623    song of the indian maid 



from ‘endymion’



          o sorrow 

          why dost borrow

    the natural hue of health  from vermeil lips   

          to give maiden blushes

          to the white rose bushes 

    or is it thy dewy hand the daisy tips 



          o sorrow 

          why dost borrow

    the lustrous passion from a falcon eye   

          to give the glow worm light 

          or  on a moonless night 

    to tinge  on siren shores  the salt sea spry 



      623   sea spry  sea spray 





            o sorrow 

            why dost borrow

      the mellow ditties from a mourning tongue   

            to give at evening pale

            unto the nightingale 

      that thou mayst listen the cold dews among 



            o sorrow 

            why dost borrow

      heart’s lightness from the merriment of may   

            a lover would not tread

            a cowslip on the head 

      though he should dance from eve till peep of day  

            nor any drooping flower

            held sacred for thy bower 

      wherever he may sport himself and play 



            to sorrow

            i bade good morrow 

      and thought to leave her far away behind 

            but cheerly  cheerly 

            she loves me dearly 

      she is so constant to me  and so kind 

            i would deceive her 

            and so leave her 

      but ah  she is so constant and so kind 



    beneath my palm trees  by the river side 

    i sat a weeping  in the whole world wide

    there was no one to ask me why i wept   

            and so i kept

    brimming the water lily cups with tears

            cold as my fears 

    beneath my palm trees  by the river side 

    i sat a weeping  what enamour’d bride 

    cheated by shadowy wooer from the clouds 

            but hides and shrouds

    beneath dark palm trees by a river side 



    and as i sat  over the light blue hills

    there came a noise of revellers  the rills

    into the wide stream came of purple hue  

            ’twas bacchus and his crew 

    the earnest trumpet spake  and silver thrills

    from kissing cymbals made a merry din  

            ’twas bacchus and his kin 

    like to a moving vintage down they came 

    crown’d with green leaves  and faces all on flame 

    all madly dancing through the pleasant valley 

            to scare thee  melancholy 

    o then  o then  thou wast a simple name 

    and i forgot thee  as the berried holly

    by shepherds is forgotten  when in june

    tall chestnuts keep away the sun and moon   

            i rush’d into the folly 



    within his car  aloft  young bacchus stood 

    trifling his ivy dart  in dancing mood 

            with sidelong laughing 

    and little rills of crimson wine imbrued

    his plump white arms and shoulders  enough white

            for venus’ pearly bite 

    and near him rode silenus on his ass 

    pelted with flowers as he on did pass

            tipsily quaffing 



    ‘whence came ye  merry damsels  whence came ye 

    so many  and so many  and such glee 

    why have ye left your bowers desolate 

            your lutes  and gentler fate ’  

    ‘we follow bacchus  bacchus on the wing 

            a conquering 

    bacchus  young bacchus  good or ill betide 

    we dance before him thorough kingdoms wide   

    come hither  lady fair  and joinèd be

            to our wild minstrelsy ’



    ‘whence came ye  jolly satyrs  whence came ye 

    so many  and so many  and such glee 

    why have ye left your forest haunts  why left

            your nuts in oak tree cleft ’  

    ‘for wine  for wine we left our kernel tree 

    for wine we left our heath  and yellow brooms 

            and cold mushrooms 

    for wine we follow bacchus through the earth 

    great god of breathless cups and chirping mirth 

    come hither  lady fair  and joinèd be

            to our mad minstrelsy ’



    over wide streams and mountains great we went 

    and  save when bacchus kept his ivy tent 

    onward the tiger and the leopard pants 

            with asian elephants 

    onward these myriads  with song and dance 

    with zebras striped  and sleek arabians’ prance 

    web footed alligators  crocodiles 

    bearing upon their scaly backs  in files 

    plump infant laughers mimicking the coil

    of seamen  and stout galley rowers’ toil 

    with toying oars and silken sails they glide 

            nor care for wind and tide 



    mounted on panthers’ furs and lions’ manes 

    from rear to van they scour about the plains 

    a three days’ journey in a moment done 

    and always  at the rising of the sun 

    about the wilds they hunt with spear and horn 

            on spleenful unicorn 



    i saw osirian egypt kneel adown

            before the vine wreath crown 

    i saw parch’d abyssinia rouse and sing

            to the silver cymbals’ ring 

    i saw the whelming vintage hotly pierce

            old tartary the fierce 

    the kings of ind their jewel sceptres vail 

    and from their treasures scatter pearlèd hail 

    great brahma from his mystic heaven groans 

            and all his priesthood moans 

    before young bacchus’ eye wink turning pale 

    into these regions came i  following him 

    sick hearted  weary  so i took a whim

    to stray away into these forests drear 

            alone  without a peer 

    and i have told thee all thou mayest hear 



            young stranger 

            i’ve been a ranger

      in search of pleasure throughout every clime 

            alas  ’tis not for me 

            bewitch’d i sure must be 

      to lose in grieving all my maiden prime 



            come then  sorrow 

            sweetest sorrow 

      like an own babe i nurse thee on my breast 

            i thought to leave thee 

            and deceive thee 

      but now of all the world i love thee best 



            there is not one 

            no  no  not one

      but thee to comfort a poor lonely maid 

            thou art her mother 

            and her brother 

      her playmate  and her wooer in the shade 





 624    ode to a nightingale 



    my heart aches  and a drowsy numbness pains

      my sense  as though of hemlock i had drunk 

    or emptied some dull opiate to the drains

      one minute past  and lethe wards had sunk 

    ’tis not through envy of thy happy lot 

      but being too happy in thy happiness 

        that thou  light wingèd dryad of the trees 

              in some melodious plot

      of beechen green  and shadows numberless 

        singest of summer in full throated ease 



    o for a draught of vintage  that hath been

      cool’d a long age in the deep delvèd earth 

    tasting of flora and the country green 

      dance  and provençal song  and sunburnt mirth 

    o for a beaker full of the warm south 

      full of the true  the blushful hippocrene 

        with beaded bubbles winking at the brim 

              and purple stainèd mouth 

      that i might drink  and leave the world unseen 

      and with thee fade away into the forest dim 



    fade far away  dissolve  and quite forget

      what thou among the leaves hast never known 

    the weariness  the fever  and the fret

      here  where men sit and hear each other groan 

    where palsy shakes a few  sad  last grey hairs 

      where youth grows pale  and spectre thin  and dies 

        where but to think is to be full of sorrow

              and leaden eyed despairs 

      where beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes 

        or new love pine at them beyond to morrow 



    away  away  for i will fly to thee 

      not charioted by bacchus and his pards 

    but on the viewless wings of poesy 

      though the dull brain perplexes and retards 

    already with thee  tender is the night 

      and haply the queen moon is on her throne 

        cluster’d around by all her starry fays

              but here there is no light 

      save what from heaven is with the breezes blown

        through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways 



    i cannot see what flowers are at my feet 

      nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs 

    but  in embalmèd darkness  guess each sweet

      wherewith the seasonable month endows

    the grass  the thicket  and the fruit tree wild 

      white hawthorn  and the pastoral eglantine 

        fast fading violets cover’d up in leaves 

              and mid may’s eldest child 

      the coming musk rose  full of dewy wine 

        the murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves 



    darkling i listen  and for many a time

      i have been half in love with easeful death 

    call’d him soft names in many a musèd rhyme 

      to take into the air my quiet breath 

    now more than ever seems it rich to die 

      to cease upon the midnight with no pain 

        while thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad

              in such an ecstasy 

      still wouldst thou sing  and i have ears in vain  

        to thy high requiem become a sod 



    thou wast not born for death  immortal bird 

      no hungry generations tread thee down 

    the voice i hear this passing night was heard

      in ancient days by emperor and clown 

    perhaps the self same song that found a path

      through the sad heart of ruth  when  sick for home 

        she stood in tears amid the alien corn 

              the same that ofttimes hath

      charm’d magic casements  opening on the foam

        of perilous seas  in faery lands forlorn 



    forlorn  the very word is like a bell

      to toll me back from thee to my sole self 

    adieu  the fancy cannot cheat so well

      as she is famed to do  deceiving elf 

    adieu  adieu  thy plaintive anthem fades

      past the near meadows  over the still stream 

        up the hill side  and now ’tis buried deep

              in the next valley glades 

      was it a vision  or a waking dream 

        fled is that music   do i wake or sleep 





 625    ode on a grecian urn 



    thou still unravish’d bride of quietness 

      thou foster child of silence and slow time 

    sylvan historian  who canst thus express

      a flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme 

    what leaf fringed legend haunts about thy shape

      of deities or mortals  or of both 

        in tempe or the dales of arcady 

      what men or gods are these  what maidens loth 

    what mad pursuit  what struggle to escape 

        what pipes and timbrels  what wild ecstasy 



    heard melodies are sweet  but those unheard

      are sweeter  therefore  ye soft pipes  play on 

    not to the sensual ear  but  more endear’d 

      pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone 

    fair youth  beneath the trees  thou canst not leave

      thy song  nor ever can those trees be bare 

        bold lover  never  never canst thou kiss 

    though winning near the goal  yet  do not grieve 

        she cannot fade  though thou hast not thy bliss 

      for ever wilt thou love  and she be fair 



    ah  happy  happy boughs  that cannot shed

      your leaves  nor ever bid the spring adieu 

    and  happy melodist  unwearièd 

      for ever piping songs for ever new 

    more happy love  more happy  happy love 

      for ever warm and still to be enjoy’d 

        for ever panting and for ever young 

    all breathing human passion far above 

      that leaves a heart high sorrowful and cloy’d 

        a burning forehead  and a parching tongue 



    who are these coming to the sacrifice 

      to what green altar  o mysterious priest 

    lead’st thou that heifer lowing at the skies 

      and all her silken flanks with garlands drest 

    what little town by river or sea shore 

      or mountain built with peaceful citadel 

        is emptied of its folk  this pious morn 

    and  little town  thy streets for evermore

      will silent be  and not a soul  to tell

        why thou art desolate  can e’er return 



    o attic shape  fair attitude  with brede

      of marble men and maidens overwrought 

    with forest branches and the trodden weed 

      thou  silent form  dost tease us out of thought

    as doth eternity  cold pastoral 

      when old age shall this generation waste 

        thou shalt remain  in midst of other woe

      than ours  a friend to man  to whom thou say’st 

    ‘beauty is truth  truth beauty   that is all

        ye know on earth  and all ye need to know ’





 626    ode to psyche 



    o goddess  hear these tuneless numbers  wrung

      by sweet enforcement and remembrance dear 

    and pardon that thy secrets should be sung

      even into thine own soft conchèd ear 

    surely i dream’d to day  or did i see

      the wingèd psyche with awaken’d eyes 

    i wander’d in a forest thoughtlessly 

      and  on the sudden  fainting with surprise 

    saw two fair creatures  couchèd side by side

      in deepest grass  beneath the whisp’ring roof

      of leaves and trembled blossoms  where there ran

              a brooklet  scarce espied 

    ’mid hush’d  cool rooted flowers fragrant eyed 

      blue  silver white  and budded tyrian

    they lay calm breathing on the bedded grass 

      their arms embracèd  and their pinions too 

      their lips touch’d not  but had not bade adieu 

    as if disjoinèd by soft handed slumber 

    and ready still past kisses to outnumber

      at tender eye dawn of aurorean love 

              the wingèd boy i knew 

      but who wast thou  o happy  happy dove 

              his psyche true 



    o latest born and loveliest vision far

      of all olympus’ faded hierarchy 

    fairer than phœbe’s sapphire region’d star 

      or vesper  amorous glow worm of the sky 

    fairer than these  though temple thou hast none 

              nor altar heap’d with flowers 

    nor virgin choir to make delicious moan

              upon the midnight hours 

    no voice  no lute  no pipe  no incense sweet

      from chain swung censer teeming 

    no shrine  no grove  no oracle  no heat

      of pale mouth’d prophet dreaming 



    o brightest  though too late for antique vows 

      too  too late for the fond believing lyre 

    when holy were the haunted forest boughs 

      holy the air  the water  and the fire 

    yet even in these days so far retired

      from happy pieties  thy lucent fans 

      fluttering among the faint olympians 

    i see  and sing  by my own eyes inspired 

    so let me be thy choir  and make a moan

              upon the midnight hours 

    thy voice  thy lute  thy pipe  thy incense sweet

      from swingèd censer teeming 

    thy shrine  thy grove  thy oracle  thy heat

      of pale mouth’d prophet dreaming 



    yes  i will be thy priest  and build a fane

      in some untrodden region of my mind 

    where branchèd thoughts  new grown with pleasant pain 

      instead of pines shall murmur in the wind 

    far  far around shall those dark cluster’d trees

      fledge the wild ridgèd mountains steep by steep 

    and there by zephyrs  streams  and birds  and bees 

      the moss lain dryads shall be lull’d to sleep 

    and in the midst of this wide quietness

    a rosy sanctuary will i dress

    with the wreath’d trellis of a working brain 

      with buds  and bells  and stars without a name 

    with all the gardener fancy e’er could feign 

      who  breeding flowers  will never breed the same 

    and there shall be for thee all soft delight

      that shadowy thought can win 

    a bright torch  and a casement ope at night 

      to let the warm love in 





 627    to autumn 



    season of mists and mellow fruitfulness 

      close bosom friend of the maturing sun 

    conspiring with him how to load and bless

      with fruit the vines that round the thatch eaves run 

    to bend with apples the moss’d cottage trees 

      and fill all fruit with ripeness to the core 

        to swell the gourd  and plump the hazel shells

      with a sweet kernel  to set budding more 

    and still more  later flowers for the bees 

    until they think warm days will never cease 

      for summer has o’er brimm’d their clammy cells 



    who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store 

      sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find

    thee sitting careless on a granary floor 

      thy hair soft lifted by the winnowing wind 

    or on a half reap’d furrow sound asleep 

      drowsed with the fume of poppies  while thy hook

        spares the next swath and all its twinèd flowers 

    and sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep

      steady thy laden head across a brook 

      or by a cider press  with patient look 

        thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours 



    where are the songs of spring  ay  where are they 

      think not of them  thou hast thy music too   

    while barrèd clouds bloom the soft dying day 

      and touch the stubble plains with rosy hue 

    then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn

      among the river sallows  borne aloft

        or sinking as the light wind lives or dies 

    and full grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn 

      hedge crickets sing  and now with treble soft

      the redbreast whistles from a garden croft 

        and gathering swallows twitter in the skies 





 628    ode on melancholy 



    no  no  go not to lethe  neither twist

      wolf’s bane  tight rooted  for its poisonous wine 

    nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kist

      by nightshade  ruby grape of proserpine 

    make not your rosary of yew berries 

      nor let the beetle  nor the death moth be

        your mournful psyche  nor the downy owl

    a partner in your sorrow’s mysteries 

      for shade to shade will come too drowsily 

        and drown the wakeful anguish of the soul 



    but when the melancholy fit shall fall

      sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud 

    that fosters the droop headed flowers all 

      and hides the green hill in an april shroud 

    then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose 

      or on the rainbow of the salt sand wave 

        or on the wealth of globèd peonies 

    or if thy mistress some rich anger shows 

      emprison her soft hand  and let her rave 

        and feed deep  deep upon her peerless eyes 



    she dwells with beauty  beauty that must die 

      and joy  whose hand is ever at his lips

    bidding adieu  and aching pleasure nigh 

      turning to poison while the bee mouth sips 

    ay  in the very temple of delight

      veil’d melancholy has her sovran shrine 

        though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue

    can burst joy’s grape against his palate fine 

      his soul shall taste the sadness of her might 

        and be among her cloudy trophies hung 





 629    fragment of an ode to maia 



  written on may day  1818  



    mother of hermes  and still youthful maia 

            may i sing to thee

    as thou wast hymnèd on the shores of baiæ 

            or may i woo thee

    in earlier sicilian  or thy smiles

    seek as they once were sought  in grecian isles 

    by bards who died content on pleasant sward 

      leaving great verse unto a little clan 

    o give me their old vigour  and unheard

      save of the quiet primrose  and the span

            of heaven  and few ears 

    rounded by thee  my song should die away

            content as theirs 

    rich in the simple worship of a day 





 630    bards of passion and of mirth 



 written on the blank page before beaumont and fletcher’s tragi comedy

‘the fair maid of the inn’ 



      bards of passion and of mirth 

    ye have left your souls on earth 

    have ye souls in heaven too 

    doubled lived in regions new 

    yes  and those of heaven commune

    with the spheres of sun and moon 

    with the noise of fountains wondrous 

    and the parle of voices thund’rous 

    with the whisper of heaven’s trees

    and one another  in soft ease

    seated on elysian lawns

    browsed by none but dian’s fawns 

    underneath large blue bells tented 

    where the daisies are rose scented 

    and the rose herself has got

    perfume which on earth is not 

    where the nightingale doth sing

    not a senseless  trancèd thing 

    but divine melodious truth 

    philosophic numbers smooth 

    tales and golden histories

    of heaven and its mysteries 



      thus ye live on high  and then

    on the earth ye live again 

    and the souls ye left behind you

    teach us  here  the way to find you 

    where your other souls are joying 

    never slumber’d  never cloying 

    here  your earth born souls still speak

    to mortals  of their little week 

    of their sorrows and delights 

    of their passions and their spites 

    of their glory and their shame 

    what doth strengthen and what maim 

    thus ye teach us  every day 

    wisdom  though fled far away 



      bards of passion and of mirth 

    ye have left your souls on earth 

    ye have souls in heaven too 

    double lived in regions new 





 631    fancy 



    ever let the fancy roam 

    pleasure never is at home 

    at a touch sweet pleasure melteth 

    like to bubbles when rain pelteth 

    then let wingèd fancy wander

    through the thought still spread beyond her 

    open wide the mind’s cage door 

    she’ll dart forth  and cloudward soar 

    o sweet fancy  let her loose 

    summer’s joys are spoilt by use 

    and the enjoying of the spring

    fades as does its blossoming 

    autumn’s red lipp’d fruitage too 

    blushing through the mist and dew 

    cloys with tasting  what do then 

    sit thee by the ingle  when

    the sear faggot blazes bright 

    spirit of a winter’s night 

    when the soundless earth is muffled 

    and the cakèd snow is shuffled

    from the ploughboy’s heavy shoon 

    when the night doth meet the noon

    in a dark conspiracy

    to banish even from her sky 

    sit thee there  and send abroad 

    with a mind self overawed 

    fancy  high commission’d   send her 

    she has vassals to attend her 

    she will bring  in spite of frost 

    beauties that the earth hath lost 

    she will bring thee  all together 

    all delights of summer weather 

    all the buds and bells of may 

    from dewy sward or thorny spray 

    all the heapèd autumn’s wealth 

    with a still  mysterious stealth 

    she will mix these pleasures up

    like three fit wines in a cup 

    and thou shalt quaff it   thou shalt hear

    distant harvest carols clear 

    rustle of the reapèd corn 

    sweet birds antheming the morn 

    and  in the same moment  hark 

    ’tis the early april lark 

    or the rooks  with busy caw 

    foraging for sticks and straw 

    thou shalt  at one glance  behold

    the daisy and the marigold 

    white plumed lilies  and the first

    hedge grown primrose that hath burst 

    shaded hyacinth  alway

    sapphire queen of the mid may 

    and every leaf  and every flower

    pearlèd with the self same shower 

    thou shalt see the fieldmouse peep

    meagre from its cellèd sleep 

    and the snake all winter thin

    cast on sunny bank its skin 

    freckled nest eggs thou shalt see

    hatching in the hawthorn tree 

    when the hen bird’s wing doth rest

    quiet on her mossy nest 

    then the hurry and alarm

    when the beehive casts its swarm 

    acorns ripe down pattering

    while the autumn breezes sing 



      o sweet fancy  let her loose 

    every thing is spoilt by use 

    where’s the cheek that doth not fade 

    too much gazed at  where’s the maid

    whose lip mature is ever new 

    where’s the eye  however blue 

    doth not weary  where’s the face

    one would meet in every place 

    where’s the voice  however soft 

    one would hear so very oft 

    at a touch sweet pleasure melteth

    like to bubbles when rain pelteth 

    let  then  wingèd fancy find

    thee a mistress to thy mind 

    dulcet eyed as ceres’ daughter 

    ere the god of torment taught her

    how to frown and how to chide 

    with a waist and with a side

    white as hebe’s  when her zone

    slipt its golden clasp  and down

    fell her kirtle to her feet 

    while she held the goblet sweet 

    and jove grew languid   break the mesh

    of the fancy’s silken leash 

    quickly break her prison string 

    and such joys as these she’ll bring   

    let the wingèd fancy roam 

    pleasure never is at home 





 632    stanzas 



    in a drear nighted december 

      too happy  happy tree 

    thy branches ne’er remember

      their green felicity 

    the north cannot undo them 

    with a sleety whistle through them 

    nor frozen thawings glue them

      from budding at the prime 



    in a drear nighted december 

      too happy  happy brook 

    thy bubblings ne’er remember

      apollo’s summer look 

    but with a sweet forgetting 

    they stay their crystal fretting 

    never  never petting

      about the frozen time 



    ah  would ’twere so with many

      a gentle girl and boy 

    but were there ever any

      writhed not at passèd joy 

    to know the change and feel it 

    when there is none to heal it 

    nor numbèd sense to steal it 

      was never said in rhyme 





 633    la belle dame sans merci 



    ‘o what can ail thee  knight at arms 

      alone and palely loitering 

    the sedge is wither’d from the lake 

          and no birds sing 



    ‘o what can ail thee  knight at arms 

      so haggard and so woe begone 

    the squirrel’s granary is full 

          and the harvest’s done 



    ‘i see a lily on thy brow

      with anguish moist and fever dew 

    and on thy cheek a fading rose

          fast withereth too ’



    ‘i met a lady in the meads 

      full beautiful  a faery’s child 

    her hair was long  her foot was light 

          and her eyes were wild 



    ‘i made a garland for her head 

      and bracelets too  and fragrant zone 

    she look’d at me as she did love 

          and made sweet moan 



    ‘i set her on my pacing steed

      and nothing else saw all day long 

    for sideways would she lean  and sing

          a faery’s song 



    ‘she found me roots of relish sweet 

      and honey wild and manna dew 

    and sure in language strange she said 

          “i love thee true ”



    ‘she took me to her elfin grot 

      and there she wept and sigh’d full sore 

    and there i shut her wild  wild eyes

          with kisses four 



    ‘and there she lullèd me asleep 

      and there i dream’d  ah  woe betide 

    the latest dream i ever dream’d

          on the cold hill’s side 



    ‘i saw pale kings and princes too 

      pale warriors  death pale were they all 

    who cried  “la belle dame sans merci

          hath thee in thrall ”



    ‘i saw their starved lips in the gloam

      with horrid warning gapèd wide 

    and i awoke and found me here

          on the cold hill’s side 



    ‘and this is why i sojourn here

      alone and palely loitering 

    though the sedge is wither’d from the lake 

          and no birds sing ’





 634    on first looking into chapman’s homer 



    much have i travell’d in the realms of gold 

      and many goodly states and kingdoms seen 

      round many western islands have i been

    which bards in fealty to apollo hold 

    oft of one wide expanse had i been told

      that deep brow’d homer ruled as his demesne 

      yet did i never breathe its pure serene

    till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold 

    then felt i like some watcher of the skies

      when a new planet swims into his ken 

    or like stout cortez  when with eagle eyes

      he stared at the pacific  and all his men

    look’d at each other with a wild surmise  

      silent  upon a peak in darien 





 635    when i have fears that i may cease to be 



    when i have fears that i may cease to be

    before my pen has glean’d my teeming brain 

    before high pilèd books  in charact’ry 

    hold like full garners the full ripen’d grain 

    when i behold  upon the night’s starr’d face 

    huge cloudy symbols of a high romance 

    and feel that i may never live to trace

    their shadows  with the magic hand of chance 

    and when i feel  fair creature of an hour 

    that i shall never look upon thee more 

    never have relish in the faery power

    of unreflecting love   then on the shore

      of the wide world i stand alone  and think 

      till love and fame to nothingness do sink 





 636    to sleep 



    o soft embalmer of the still midnight 

      shutting with careful fingers and benign

    our gloom pleased eyes  embower’d from the light 

      enshaded in forgetfulness divine 

    o soothest sleep  if so it please thee  close 

      in midst of this thine hymn  my willing eyes 

    or wait the amen  ere thy poppy throws

      around my bed its lulling charities 

      then save me  or the passèd day will shine

    upon my pillow  breeding many woes 

    save me from curious conscience  that still lords

      its strength for darkness  burrowing like a mole 

    turn the key deftly in the oilèd wards 

      and seal the hushèd casket of my soul 





 637    last sonnet 



    bright star  would i were steadfast as thou art  

    not in lone splendour hung aloft the night 

    and watching  with eternal lids apart 

    like nature’s patient sleepless eremite 

    the moving waters at their priest like task

    of pure ablution round earth’s human shores 

    or gazing on the new soft fallen mask

    of snow upon the mountains and the moors  

    no  yet still steadfast  still unchangeable 

    pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast 

    to feel for ever its soft fall and swell 

    awake for ever in a sweet unrest 

      still  still to hear her tender taken breath 

      and so live ever  or else swoon to death

 638    the outlaw of loch lene 



from the irish



    o many a day have i made good ale in the glen 

    that came not of stream or malt  like the brewing of men 

    my bed was the ground  my roof  the green wood above 

    and the wealth that i sought  one far kind glance from my love 



    alas  on that night when the horses i drove from the field 

    that i was not near from terror my angel to shield 

    she stretch’d forth her arms  her mantle she flung to the wind 

    and swam o’er loch lene  her outlaw’d lover to find 



    o would that a freezing sleet wing’d tempest did sweep 

    and i and my love were alone  far off on the deep 

    i’d ask not a ship  or a bark  or a pinnace  to save  

    with her hand round my waist  i’d fear not the wind or the wave 



    ’tis down by the lake where the wild tree fringes its sides 

    the maid of my heart  my fair one of heaven resides 

    i think  as at eve she wanders its mazes among 

    the birds go to sleep by the sweet wild twist of her song

 639  



    too solemn for day  too sweet for night 

      come not in darkness  come not in light 

    but come in some twilight interim 

      when the gloom is soft  and the light is dim

 640    song 



    sweet in her green dell the flower of beauty slumbers 

      lull’d by the faint breezes sighing through her hair 

    sleeps she and hears not the melancholy numbers

      breathed to my sad lute ’mid the lonely air 



    down from the high cliffs the rivulet is teeming

      to wind round the willow banks that lure him from above 

    o that in tears  from my rocky prison streaming 

      i too could glide to the bower of my love 



    ah  where the woodbines with sleepy arms have wound her 

      opes she her eyelids at the dream of my lay 

    listening  like the dove  while the fountains echo round her 

      to her lost mate’s call in the forests far away 



    come then  my bird  for the peace thou ever bearest 

      still heaven’s messenger of comfort to me  

    come  this fond bosom  o faithfullest and fairest 

      bleeds with its death wound  its wound of love for thee 





 641    to helene 



 on a gift ring carelessly lost 



    i sent a ring  a little band

      of emerald and ruby stone 

    and bade it  sparkling on thy hand 

      tell thee sweet tales of one

        whose constant memory

        was full of loveliness  and thee 



    a shell was graven on its gold   

      ’twas cupid fix’d without his wings  

    to helene once it would have told

      more than was ever told by rings 

        but now all’s past and gone 

        her love is buried with that stone 



    thou shalt not see the tears that start

      from eyes by thoughts like these beguiled 

    thou shalt not know the beating heart 

      ever a victim and a child 

        yet helene  love  believe

        the heart that never could deceive 



    i’ll hear thy voice of melody

      in the sweet whispers of the air 

    i’ll see the brightness of thine eye

      in the blue evening’s dewy star 

        in crystal streams thy purity 

        and look on heaven to look on thee 





 642    the fallen star 



    a star is gone  a star is gone 

      there is a blank in heaven 

    one of the cherub choir has done

      his airy course this even 



    he sat upon the orb of fire

      that hung for ages there 

    and lent his music to the choir

      that haunts the nightly air 



    but when his thousand years are pass’d 

      with a cherubic sigh

    he vanish’d with his car at last 

      for even cherubs die 



    hear how his angel brothers mourn  

      the minstrels of the spheres  

    each chiming sadly in his turn

      and dropping splendid tears 



    the planetary sisters all

      join in the fatal song 

    and weep this hapless brother’s fall 

      who sang with them so long 



    but deepest of the choral band

      the lunar spirit sings 

    and with a bass according hand

      sweeps all her sullen strings 



    from the deep chambers of the dome

      where sleepless uriel lies 

    his rude harmonic thunders come

      mingled with mighty sighs 





    the thousand car borne cherubim 

      the wandering eleven 

    all join to chant the dirge of him

      who fell just now from heaven

 643    the solitary hearted 



    she was a queen of noble nature’s crowning 

    a smile of hers was like an act of grace 

    she had no winsome looks  no pretty frowning 

    like daily beauties of the vulgar race 

    but if she smiled  a light was on her face 

    a clear  cool kindliness  a lunar beam

    of peaceful radiance  silvering o’er the stream

    of human thought with unabiding glory 

    not quite a waking truth  not quite a dream 

    a visitation  bright and transitory 



    but she is changed   hath felt the touch of sorrow 

    no love hath she  no understanding friend 

    o grief  when heaven is forced of earth to borrow

    what the poor niggard earth has not to lend 

    but when the stalk is snapt  the rose must bend 

    the tallest flower that skyward rears its head

    grows from the common ground  and there must shed

    its delicate petals  cruel fate  too surely 

    that they should find so base a bridal bed 

    who lived in virgin pride  so sweet and purely 



    she had a brother  and a tender father 

    and she was loved  but not as others are

    from whom we ask return of love   but rather

    as one might love a dream  a phantom fair

    of something exquisitely strange and rare 

    which all were glad to look on  men and maids 

    yet no one claim’d  as oft  in dewy glades 

    the peering primrose  like a sudden gladness 

    gleams on the soul  yet unregarded fades   

    the joy is ours  but all its own the sadness 



    ’tis vain to say  her worst of grief is only

    the common lot  which all the world have known 

    to her ’tis more  because her heart is lonely 

    and yet she hath no strength to stand alone   

    once she had playmates  fancies of her own 

    and she did love them  they are past away

    as fairies vanish at the break of day 

    and like a spectre of an age departed 

    or unsphered angel wofully astray 

    she glides along  the solitary hearted 





 644    song 



    she is not fair to outward view

    as many maidens be 

    her loveliness i never knew

      until she smiled on me 

    o  then i saw her eye was bright 

    a well of love  a spring of light 



    but now her looks are coy and cold 

    to mine they ne’er reply 

    and yet i cease not to behold

      the love light in her eye 

    her very frowns are fairer far

    than smiles of other maidens are 





 645    early death 



    she pass’d away like morning dew

      before the sun was high 

    so brief her time  she scarcely knew

      the meaning of a sigh 



    as round the rose its soft perfume 

      sweet love around her floated 

    admired she grew  while mortal doom

      crept on  unfear’d  unnoted 



    love was her guardian angel here 

      but love to death resign’d her 

    tho’ love was kind  why should we fear

      but holy death is kinder 





 646    friendship 



    when we were idlers with the loitering rills 

      the need of human love we little noted 

      our love was nature  and the peace that floated

    on the white mist  and dwelt upon the hills 

    to sweet accord subdued our wayward wills 

      one soul was ours  one mind  one heart devoted 

      that  wisely doting  ask’d not why it doted 

    and ours the unknown joy  which knowing kills 

    but now i find how dear thou wert to me 

      that man is more than half of nature’s treasure 

    of that fair beauty which no eye can see 

      of that sweet music which no ear can measure 

      and now the streams may sing for others’ pleasure 

    the hills sleep on in their eternity

 647    autumn 



    i saw old autumn in the misty morn

    stand shadowless like silence  listening

    to silence  for no lonely bird would sing

    into his hollow ear from woods forlorn 

    nor lowly hedge nor solitary thorn   

    shaking his languid locks all dewy bright

    with tangled gossamer that fell by night 

      pearling his coronet of golden corn 



    where are the songs of summer   with the sun 

    oping the dusky eyelids of the south 

    till shade and silence waken up as one 

    and morning sings with a warm odorous mouth 

    where are the merry birds   away  away 

    on panting wings through the inclement skies 

          lest owls should prey

          undazzled at noonday 

    and tear with horny beak their lustrous eyes 



    where are the blooms of summer   in the west 

    blushing their last to the last sunny hours 

    when the mild eve by sudden night is prest

    like tearful proserpine  snatch’d from her flow’rs

          to a most gloomy breast 

    where is the pride of summer   the green prime   

    the many  many leaves all twinkling   three

    on the moss’d elm  three on the naked lime

    trembling   and one upon the old oak tree 

      where is the dryad’s immortality   

    gone into mournful cypress and dark yew 

    or wearing the long gloomy winter through

      in the smooth holly’s green eternity 





    the squirrel gloats on his accomplished hoard 

    the ants have brimm’d their garners with ripe grain 

        and honey bees have stored

    the sweets of summer in their luscious cells 

    the swallows all have wing’d across the main 

    but here the autumn melancholy dwells 

        and sighs her tearful spells

    amongst the sunless shadows of the plain 

          alone  alone 

          upon a mossy stone 

    she sits and reckons up the dead and gone

    with the last leaves for a love rosary 

    whilst all the wither’d world looks drearily 

    like a dim picture of the drownèd past

    in the hush’d mind’s mysterious far away 

    doubtful what ghostly thing will steal the last

    into that distance  gray upon the gray 



    o go and sit with her  and be o’ershaded

    under the languid downfall of her hair 

    she wears a coronal of flowers faded

    upon her forehead  and a face of care   

    there is enough of wither’d everywhere

    to make her bower   and enough of gloom 

    there is enough of sadness to invite 

    if only for the rose that died  whose doom

    is beauty’s   she that with the living bloom

    of conscious cheeks most beautifies the light 

    there is enough of sorrowing  and quite

    enough of bitter fruits the earth doth bear   

    enough of chilly droppings for her bowl 

    enough of fear and shadowy despair 

    to frame her cloudy prison for the soul 





 648    silence 



    there is a silence where hath been no sound 

      there is a silence where no sound may be 

      in the cold grave  under the deep  deep sea 

    or in wide desert where no life is found 

    which hath been mute  and still must sleep profound 

      no voice is hush’d  no life treads silently 

      but clouds and cloudy shadows wander free 

    that never spoke  over the idle ground 

    but in green ruins  in the desolate walls

      of antique palaces  where man hath been 

    though the dun fox or wild hyæna calls 

      and owls  that flit continually between 

    shriek to the echo  and the low winds moan  

    there the true silence is  self conscious and alone 





 649    death 



    it is not death  that sometime in a sigh

      this eloquent breath shall take its speechless flight 

    that sometime these bright stars  that now reply

      in sunlight to the sun  shall set in night 

      that this warm conscious flesh shall perish quite 

    and all life’s ruddy springs forget to flow 

      that thoughts shall cease  and the immortal sprite

    be lapp’d in alien clay and laid below 

    it is not death to know this  but to know

      that pious thoughts  which visit at new graves

    in tender pilgrimage  will cease to go

      so duly and so oft  and when grass waves

    over the pass’d away  there may be then

    no resurrection in the minds of men 





 650    fair ines 



    o saw ye not fair ines 

      she’s gone into the west 

    to dazzle when the sun is down 

      and rob the world of rest 

    she took our daylight with her 

      the smiles that we love best 

    with morning blushes on her cheek 

      and pearls upon her breast 



    o turn again  fair ines 

      before the fall of night 

    for fear the moon should shine alone 

      and stars unrivall’d bright 

    and blessèd will the lover be

      that walks beneath their light 

    and breathes the love against thy cheek

      i dare not even write 



    would i had been  fair ines 

      that gallant cavalier 

    who rode so gaily by thy side 

      and whisper’d thee so near 

    were there no bonny dames at home 

      or no true lovers here 

    that he should cross the seas to win

      the dearest of the dear 



    i saw thee  lovely ines 

      descend along the shore 

    with bands of noble gentlemen 

      and banners waved before 

    and gentle youth and maidens gay 

      and snowy plumes they wore 

    it would have been a beauteous dream   

      if it had been no more 



    alas  alas  fair ines 

      she went away with song 

    with music waiting on her steps 

      and shoutings of the throng 

    but some were sad  and felt no mirth 

      but only music’s wrong 

    in sounds that sang farewell  farewell 

      to her you’ve loved so long 



    farewell  farewell  fair ines 

      that vessel never bore

    so fair a lady on its deck 

      nor danced so light before   

    alas for pleasure on the sea 

      and sorrow on the shore 

    the smile that bless’d one lover’s heart

      has broken many more 





 651    time of roses 



    it was not in the winter

      our loving lot was cast 

    it was the time of roses  

      we pluck’d them as we pass’d 



    that churlish season never frown’d

      on early lovers yet 

    o no  the world was newly crown’d

      with flowers when first we met 





    ’twas twilight  and i bade you go 

      but still you held me fast 

    it was the time of roses  

      we pluck’d them as we pass’d 





 652    ruth 



    she stood breast high amid the corn 

    clasp’d by the golden light of morn 

    like the sweetheart of the sun 

    who many a glowing kiss had won 



    on her cheek an autumn flush 

    deeply ripen’d   such a blush

    in the midst of brown was born 

    like red poppies grown with corn 



    round her eyes her tresses fell 

    which were blackest none could tell 

    but long lashes veiled a light 

    that had else been all too bright 



    and her hat  with shady brim 

    made her tressy forehead dim 

    thus she stood amid the stooks 

    praising god with sweetest looks   



    sure  i said  heav’n did not mean 

    where i reap thou shouldst but glean 

    lay thy sheaf adown and come 

    share my harvest and my home 





 653    the death bed 



    we watch’d her breathing thro’ the night 

      her breathing soft and low 

    as in her breast the wave of life

      kept heaving to and fro 



    so silently we seem’d to speak 

      so slowly moved about 

    as we had lent her half our powers

      to eke her living out 



    our very hopes belied our fears 

      our fears our hopes belied  

    we thought her dying when she slept 

      and sleeping when she died 



    for when the morn came dim and sad 

      and chill with early showers 

    her quiet eyelids closed  she had

      another morn than ours 





 654    the bridge of sighs 



    one more unfortunate 

      weary of breath 

    rashly importunate 

      gone to her death 



    take her up tenderly 

      lift her with care 

    fashion’d so slenderly

      young  and so fair 





    look at her garments

    clinging like cerements 

    whilst the wave constantly

      drips from her clothing 

    take her up instantly 

      loving  not loathing 



    touch her not scornfully 

    think of her mournfully 

      gently and humanly 

    not of the stains of her 

    all that remains of her

      now is pure womanly 



    make no deep scrutiny

    into her mutiny

      rash and undutiful 

    past all dishonour 

    death has left on her

      only the beautiful 



    still  for all slips of hers 

      one of eve’s family  

    wipe those poor lips of hers

      oozing so clammily 



    loop up her tresses

      escaped from the comb 

    her fair auburn tresses 

    whilst wonderment guesses

      where was her home 



    who was her father 

      who was her mother 

    had she a sister 

      had she a brother 

    or was there a dearer one

    still  and a nearer one

      yet  than all other 



    alas  for the rarity

    of christian charity

      under the sun 

    o  it was pitiful 

    near a whole city full 

      home she had none 



    sisterly  brotherly 

    fatherly  motherly

      feelings had changed 

    love  by harsh evidence 

    thrown from its eminence 

    even god’s providence

      seeming estranged 



    where the lamps quiver

    so far in the river 

      with many a light

    from window and casement 

    from garret to basement 

    she stood  with amazement 

      houseless by night 



    the bleak wind of march

      made her tremble and shiver 

    but not the dark arch 

    or the black flowing river 





    mad from life’s history 

    glad to death’s mystery 

      swift to be hurl’d  

    anywhere  anywhere

      out of the world 



    in she plunged boldly  

    no matter how coldly

      the rough river ran  

    over the brink of it 

    picture it  think of it 

      dissolute man 

    lave in it  drink of it 

      then  if you can 



    take her up tenderly 

      lift her with care 

    fashion’d so slenderly 

      young  and so fair 



    ere her limbs frigidly

    stiffen too rigidly 

      decently  kindly 

    smooth and compose them 

    and her eyes  close them 

      staring so blindly 



    dreadfully staring

      thro’ muddy impurity 

    as when with the daring

    last look of despairing

      fix’d on futurity 



    perishing gloomily 

    spurr’d by contumely 

    cold inhumanity 

    burning insanity 

      into her rest   

    cross her hands humbly

    as if praying dumbly 

      over her breast 



    owning her weakness 

      her evil behaviour 

    and leaving  with meekness 

      her sins to her saviour

    heard on lavernia scargill’s whispering trees

    beheld each night my home in fever’d sleep 

    each morning started from the dream to weep 

    till god  who saw me tried too sorely  gave

    the resting place i ask’d  an early grave 

    o thou  whom chance leads to this nameless stone 

    from that proud country which was once mine own 

    by those white cliffs i never more must see 

    by that dear language which i spake like thee 

    forget all feuds  and shed one english tear

    o’er english dust  a broken heart lies here

    i’d a dream to night

      as i fell asleep 

    o  the touching sight

      makes me still to weep 

    of my little lad 

    gone to leave me sad 

    ay  the child i had 

      but was not to keep 



    as in heaven high 

      i my child did seek 

    there in train came by

      children fair and meek 

    each in lily white 

    with a lamp alight 

    each was clear to sight 

      but they did not speak 



    then  a little sad 

      came my child in turn 

    but the lamp he had 

      o it did not burn 

    he  to clear my doubt 

    said  half turn’d about 

    ‘your tears put it out 

      mother  never mourn ’

 661    o sleep my babe 



    sleep  my babe  hear not the rippling wave 

    nor feel the breeze that round thee ling’ring strays

          to drink thy balmy breath 

          and sigh one long farewell 



    soon shall it mourn above thy wat’ry bed 

    and whisper to me  on the wave beat shore 

          deep murm’ring in reproach 

          thy sad untimely fate 



    ere those dear eyes had open’d on the light 

    in vain to plead  thy coming life was sold 

          o waken’d but to sleep 

          whence it can wake no more 



    a thousand and a thousand silken leaves

    the tufted beech unfolds in early spring 

          all clad in tenderest green 

          all of the self same shape 



    a thousand infant faces  soft and sweet 

    each year sends forth  yet every mother views

          her last not least beloved

          like its dear self alone 



    no musing mind hath ever yet foreshaped

    the face to morrow’s sun shall first reveal 

          no heart hath e’er conceived

          what love that face will bring 



    o sleep  my babe  nor heed how mourns the gale

    to part with thy soft locks and fragrant breath 

          as when it deeply sighs

          o’er autumn’s latest bloom 





 662    the child 



    see yon blithe child that dances in our sight 

    can gloomy shadows fall from one so bright 

                fond mother  whence these fears 

    while buoyantly he rushes o’er the lawn 

    dream not of clouds to stain his manhood’s dawn 

                nor dim that sight with tears 



    no cloud he spies in brightly glowing hours 

    but feels as if the newly vested bowers

                for him could never fade 

    too well we know that vernal pleasures fleet 

    but having him  so gladsome  fair  and sweet 

                our loss is overpaid 



    amid the balmiest flowers that earth can give

    some bitter drops distil  and all that live

                a mingled portion share 

    but  while he learns these truths which we lament 

    such fortitude as ours will sure be sent 

                such solace to his care

    when like the early rose 

                  eileen aroon 

    beauty in childhood blows 

                  eileen aroon 

    when  like a diadem 

    buds blush around the stem 

    which is the fairest gem   

                  eileen aroon 



    is it the laughing eye 

                  eileen aroon 

    is it the timid sigh 

                  eileen aroon 

    is it the tender tone 

    soft as the string’d harp’s moan 

    o  it is truth alone   

                  eileen aroon 



    when like the rising day 

                  eileen aroon 

    love sends his early ray 

                  eileen aroon 

    what makes his dawning glow 

    changeless through joy or woe 

    only the constant know   

                  eileen aroon 



    i know a valley fair 

                  eileen aroon 

    i knew a cottage there 

                  eileen aroon 

    far in that valley’s shade

    i knew a gentle maid 

    flower of a hazel glade   

                  eileen aroon 



    who in the song so sweet 

                  eileen aroon 

    who in the dance so fleet 

                  eileen aroon 

    dear were her charms to me 

    dearer her laughter free 

    dearest her constancy   

                  eileen aroon 



    were she no longer true 

                  eileen aroon 

    what should her lover do 

                  eileen aroon 

    fly with his broken chain

    far o’er the sounding main 

    never to love again   

                  eileen aroon 



    youth must with time decay 

                  eileen aroon 

    beauty must fade away 

                  eileen aroon 

    castles are sack’d in war 

    chieftains are scatter’d far 

    truth is a fixèd star

    o my dark rosaleen 

      do not sigh  do not weep 

    the priests are on the ocean green 

      they march along the deep 

    there’s wine from the royal pope 

      upon the ocean green 

    and spanish ale shall give you hope 

      my dark rosaleen 

      my own rosaleen 

    shall glad your heart  shall give you hope 

    shall give you health  and help  and hope 

      my dark rosaleen 



    over hills  and thro’ dales 

      have i roam’d for your sake 

    all yesterday i sail’d with sails

      on river and on lake 

    the erne  at its highest flood 

      i dash’d across unseen 

    for there was lightning in my blood 

      my dark rosaleen 

      my own rosaleen 

    o  there was lightning in my blood 

    red lightning lighten’d thro’ my blood 

      my dark rosaleen 



    all day long  in unrest 

      to and fro  do i move 

    the very soul within my breast

      is wasted for you  love 

    the heart in my bosom faints

      to think of you  my queen 

    my life of life  my saint of saints 

      my dark rosaleen 

      my own rosaleen 

    to hear your sweet and sad complaints 

    my life  my love  my saint of saints 

      my dark rosaleen 



    woe and pain  pain and woe 

      are my lot  night and noon 

    to see your bright face clouded so 

      like to the mournful moon 

    but yet will i rear your throne

      again in golden sheen 

    ’tis you shall reign  shall reign alone 

      my dark rosaleen 

      my own rosaleen 

    ’tis you shall have the golden throne 

    ’tis you shall reign  and reign alone 

      my dark rosaleen 



    over dews  over sands 

      will i fly  for your weal 

    your holy delicate white hands

      shall girdle me with steel 

    at home  in your emerald bowers 

      from morning’s dawn till e’en 

    you’ll pray for me  my flower of flowers 

      my dark rosaleen 

      my fond rosaleen 

    you’ll think of me through daylight hours 

    my virgin flower  my flower of flowers 

      my dark rosaleen 



    i could scale the blue air 

      i could plough the high hills 

    o  i could kneel all night in prayer 

      to heal your many ills 

    and one beamy smile from you

      would float like light between

    my toils and me  my own  my true 

      my dark rosaleen 

      my fond rosaleen 

    would give me life and soul anew 

    a second life  a soul anew 

      my dark rosaleen 



    o  the erne shall run red 

      with redundance of blood 

    the earth shall rock beneath our tread 

      and flames wrap hill and wood 

    and gun peal and slogan cry

      wake many a glen serene 

    ere you shall fade  ere you shall die 

      my dark rosaleen 

      my own rosaleen 

    the judgement hour must first be nigh 

    ere you can fade  ere you can die

 665    the nameless one 



    roll forth  my song  like the rushing river 

      that sweeps along to the mighty sea 

    god will inspire me while i deliver

                      my soul of thee 



    tell thou the world  when my bones lie whitening

      amid the last homes of youth and eld 

    that once there was one whose veins ran lightning

                      no eye beheld 



    tell how his boyhood was one drear night hour 

      how shone for him  through his griefs and gloom 

    no star of all heaven sends to light our

                      path to the tomb 



    roll on  my song  and to after ages

      tell how  disdaining all earth can give 

    he would have taught men  from wisdom’s pages 

                      the way to live 



    and tell how trampled  derided  hated 

      and worn by weakness  disease  and wrong 

    he fled for shelter to god  who mated

                      his soul with song 



      with song which alway  sublime or vapid 

      flow’d like a rill in the morning beam 

    perchance not deep  but intense and rapid  

                      a mountain stream 



    tell how this nameless  condemn’d for years long

      to herd with demons from hell beneath 

    saw things that made him  with groans and tears  long

                      for even death 



    go on to tell how  with genius wasted 

      betray’d in friendship  befool’d in love 

    with spirit shipwreck’d  and young hopes blasted 

                      he still  still strove 



    till  spent with toil  dreeing death for others

       and some whose hands should have wrought for him 

    if children live not for sires and mothers  

                      his mind grew dim 



    and he fell far through that pit abysmal 

      the gulf and grave of maginn and burns 

    and pawn’d his soul for the devil’s dismal

                      stock of returns 



    but yet redeemed it in days of darkness 

      and shapes and signs of the final wrath 

    when death  in hideous and ghastly starkness 

                      stood on his path 



    and tell how now  amid wreck and sorrow 

      and want  and sickness  and houseless nights 

    he bides in calmness the silent morrow 

                      that no ray lights 



    and lives he still  then  yes  old and hoary

      at thirty nine  from despair and woe 

    he lives  enduring what future story

                      will never know 



    him grant a grave to  ye pitying noble 

      deep in your bosoms  there let him dwell 

    he too  had tears for all souls in trouble 

                      here and in hell

 666    wolfram’s dirge 



    if thou wilt ease thine heart

    of love and all its smart 

      then sleep  dear  sleep 

    and not a sorrow

      hang any tear on your eyelashes 

        lie still and deep 

      sad soul  until the sea wave washes

    the rim of the sun to morrow 

        in eastern sky 



    but wilt thou cure thine heart

    of love and all its smart 

      then die  dear  die 

    ’tis deeper  sweeter 

      than on a rose bank to lie dreaming

        with folded eye 

      and there alone  amid the beaming

    of love’s stars  thou’lt meet her

        in eastern sky 





 667    dream pedlary 



    if there were dreams to sell 

        what would you buy 

    some cost a passing bell 

        some a light sigh 

    that shakes from life’s fresh crown

    only a rose leaf down 

    if there were dreams to sell 

    merry and sad to tell 

    and the crier rang the bell 

        what would you buy 



    a cottage lone and still 

        with bowers nigh 

    shadowy  my woes to still 

        until i die 

    such pearl from life’s fresh crown

    fain would i shake me down 

    were dreams to have at will 

    this would best heal my ill 

        this would i buy 





 668    song 



    how many times do i love thee  dear 

      tell me how many thoughts there be

              in the atmosphere

              of a new fall’n year 

    whose white and sable hours appear

      the latest flake of eternity 

    so many times do i love thee  dear 



    how many times do i love again 

      tell me how many beads there are

              in a silver chain

              of evening rain 

    unravell’d from the tumbling main 

      and threading the eye of a yellow star 

    so many times do i love again

 669    give all to love 



    give all to love 

    obey thy heart 

    friends  kindred  days 

    estate  good fame 

    plans  credit  and the muse  

    nothing refuse 



    ’tis a brave master 

    let it have scope 

    follow it utterly 

    hope beyond hope 

    high and more high

    it dives into noon 

    with wing unspent 

    untold intent 

    but it is a god 

    knows its own path 

    and the outlets of the sky 



    it was never for the mean 

    it requireth courage stout 

    souls above doubt 

    valour unbending 

    such ’twill reward   

    they shall return

    more than they were 

    and ever ascending 



    leave all for love 

    yet  hear me  yet 

    one word more thy heart behoved 

    one pulse more of firm endeavour  

    keep thee to day 

    to morrow  for ever 

    free as an arab

    of thy beloved 



    cling with life to the maid 

    but when the surprise 

    first vague shadow of surmise 

    flits across her bosom young 

    of a joy apart from thee 

    free be she  fancy free 

    nor thou detain her vesture’s hem 

    nor the palest rose she flung

    from her summer diadem 



    though thou loved her as thyself 

    as a self of purer clay 

    though her parting dims the day 

    stealing grace from all alive 

    heartily know

 670    uriel 



    it fell in the ancient periods

      which the brooding soul surveys 

    or ever the wild time coin’d itself

      into calendar months and days 



    this was the lapse of uriel 

    which in paradise befell 

    once  among the pleiads walking 

    sayd overheard the young gods talking 

    and the treason  too long pent 

    to his ears was evident 

    the young deities discuss’d

    laws of form  and metre just 

    orb  quintessence  and sunbeams 

    what subsisteth  and what seems 

    one  with low tones that decide 

    and doubt and reverend use defied 

    with a look that solved the sphere 

    and stirr’d the devils everywhere 

    gave his sentiment divine

    against the being of a line 

    ‘line in nature is not found 

    unit and universe are round 

    in vain produced  all rays return 

    evil will bless  and ice will burn ’

    as uriel spoke with piercing eye 

    a shudder ran around the sky 

    the stern old war gods shook their heads 

    the seraphs frown’d from myrtle beds 

    seem’d to the holy festival

    the rash word boded ill to all 

    the balance beam of fate was bent 

    the bounds of good and ill were rent 

    strong hades could not keep his own 

    but all slid to confusion 



    a sad self knowledge withering fell

    on the beauty of uriel 

    in heaven once eminent  the god

    withdrew that hour into his cloud 

    whether doom’d to long gyration

    in the sea of generation 

    or by knowledge grown too bright

    to hit the nerve of feebler sight 

    straightway a forgetting wind

    stole over the celestial kind 

    and their lips the secret kept 

    if in ashes the fire seed slept 

    but  now and then  truth speaking things

    shamed the angels’ veiling wings 

    and  shrilling from the solar course 

    or from fruit of chemic force 

    procession of a soul in matter 

    or the speeding change of water 

    or out of the good of evil born 

    came uriel’s voice of cherub scorn 

    and a blush tinged the upper sky 

    and the gods shook  they knew not why

    bring me wine  but wine which never grew

    in the belly of the grape 

    or grew on vine whose tap roots  reaching through

    under the andes to the cape 

    suffer’d no savour of the earth to ’scape 



    let its grapes the morn salute

    from a nocturnal root 

    which feels the acrid juice

    of styx and erebus

    wine of wine 

    blood of the world 

    form of forms  and mould of statures 

    that i intoxicated 

    and by the draught assimilated 

    may float at pleasure through all natures 

    the bird language rightly spell 

    and that which roses say so well 



    wine that is shed

    like the torrents of the sun

    up the horizon walls 

    or like the atlantic streams  which run

    when the south sea calls 



    water and bread 

    food which needs no transmuting 

    rainbow flowering  wisdom fruiting 

    wine which is already man 

    food which teach and reason can 



    wine which music is   

    music and wine are one   

    that i  drinking this 

    shall hear far chaos talk with me 

    kings unborn shall walk with me 

    and the poor grass shall plot and plan

    what it will do when it is man 

    quicken’d so  will i unlock

    every crypt of every rock 



    i thank the joyful juice

    for all i know 

    winds of remembering

    of the ancient being blow 

    and seeming solid walls of use

    open and flow 



    pour  bacchus  the remembering wine 

    retrieve the loss of me and mine 

    vine for vine be antidote 

    and the grape requite the lote 

    haste to cure the old despair 

    reason in nature’s lotus drench’d  

    the memory of ages quench’d  

    give them again to shine 

    let wine repair what this undid 

    and where the infection slid 

    a dazzling memory revive 

    refresh the faded tints 

    recut the agèd prints 

    and write my old adventures with the pen

    which on the first day drew 

    upon the tablets blue 

    the dancing pleiads and eternal men

    far or forgot to me is near 

      shadow and sunlight are the same 

    the vanish’d gods to me appear 

      and one to me are shame and fame 



    they reckon ill who leave me out 

      when me they fly  i am the wings 

    i am the doubter and the doubt 

      and i the hymn the brahmin sings 



    the strong gods pine for my abode 

      and pine in vain the sacred seven 

    but thou  meek lover of the good 

      find me  and turn thy back on heaven

a landscape in berkshire



    above yon sombre swell of land

      thou see’st the dawn’s grave orange hue 

    with one pale streak like yellow sand 

      and over that a vein of blue 



    the air is cold above the woods 

      all silent is the earth and sky 

    except with his own lonely moods

      the blackbird holds a colloquy 



    over the broad hill creeps a beam 

      like hope that gilds a good man’s brow 

    and now ascends the nostril stream

      of stalwart horses come to plough 





    ye rigid ploughmen  bear in mind

      your labour is for future hours 

    advance  spare not  nor look behind  

      plough deep and straight with all your powers

      drain ye the reeds for wine 

    drink hael  the milk was hid

      that soothed that babe divine 

    hush’d  as this hollow channel flows 

    he drew the balsam from the rose 



    waes hael  thus glow’d the breast

    drink hael  so jesu press’d

      life from its mystic spring 

    then hush and bend in reverent sign

      lo  christmas children we 

    drink hael  behold we lean

      at a far mother’s knee 

    to dream that thus her bosom smiled 

    and learn the lip of bethlehem’s child 





 675    are they not all ministering spirits  



    we see them not  we cannot hear

      the music of their wing  

    yet know we that they sojourn near 

      the angels of the spring 



    they glide along this lovely ground

      when the first violet grows 

    their graceful hands have just unbound

      the zone of yonder rose 



    i gather it for thy dear breast 

      from stain and shadow free 

    that which an angel’s touch hath blest

      is meet  my love  for thee

    o for the mighty wakening that aroused

      the old time prophets to their missions high 

      and to blind homer’s inward sunlike eye

    show’d the heart’s universe where he caroused

    radiantly  the fishers poor unhoused 

      and sent them forth to preach divinity 

      and made our milton his great dark defy 

    to the light of one immortal theme espoused 

    but half asleep are those now most awake 

      and save calm thoughted wordsworth  we have none

    who for eternity put time at stake 

      and hold a constant course as doth the sun 

    we yield but drops that no deep thirstings slake 

      and feebly cease ere we have well begun

 677    the bells of shandon 



    with deep affection 

      and recollection 

    i often think of

      those shandon bells 

    whose sounds so wild would 

    in the days of childhood 

    fling around my cradle

      their magic spells 

    on this i ponder

    where’er i wander 

    and thus grow fonder 

      sweet cork  of thee 

    with thy bells of shandon 

    that sound so grand on

    the pleasant waters

      of the river lee 



    i’ve heard bells chiming

    full many a clime in 

    tolling sublime in

      cathedral shrine 

    while at a glib rate

    brass tongues would vibrate  

    but all their music

      spoke naught like thine 

    for memory  dwelling

    on each proud swelling

    of the belfry knelling

      its bold notes free 

    made the bells of shandon

    sound far more grand on

    the pleasant waters

      of the river lee 



    i’ve heard bells tolling

    old adrian’s mole in 

    their thunder rolling

      from the vatican 

    and cymbals glorious

    swinging uproarious

    in the gorgeous turrets

      of notre dame 

    but thy sounds were sweeter

    than the dome of peter

    flings o’er the tiber 

      pealing solemnly  

    o  the bells of shandon

    sound far more grand on

    the pleasant waters

      of the river lee 



    there’s a bell in moscow 

    while on tower and kiosk o 

    in saint sophia

      the turkman gets 

    and loud in air

    calls men to prayer

    from the tapering summits

      of tall minarets 

    such empty phantom

    i freely grant them 

    but there’s an anthem

      more dear to me   

    ’tis the bells of shandon 

    that sound so grand on

    the pleasant waters

      of the river lee

 678    rosalind’s scroll 



    i left thee last  a child at heart 

      a woman scarce in years 

    i come to thee  a solemn corpse

      which neither feels nor fears 

    i have no breath to use in sighs 

    they laid the dead weights on mine eyes

      to seal them safe from tears 



    look on me with thine own calm look 

      i meet it calm as thou 

    no look of thine can change this smile 

      or break thy sinful vow 

    i tell thee that my poor scorn’d heart

    is of thine earth  thine earth  a part 

      it cannot vex thee now 



    i have pray’d for thee with bursting sob

      when passion’s course was free 

    i have pray’d for thee with silent lips

      in the anguish none could see 

    they whisper’d oft  ‘she sleepeth soft’  

      but i only pray’d for thee 



    go to  i pray for thee no more 

      the corpse’s tongue is still 

    its folded fingers point to heaven 

      but point there stiff and chill 

    no farther wrong  no farther woe

    hath licence from the sin below

      its tranquil heart to thrill 



    i charge thee  by the living’s prayer 

      and the dead’s silentness 

    to wring from out thy soul a cry

      which god shall hear and bless 

    lest heaven’s own palm droop in my hand 

    and pale among the saints i stand 

      a saint companionless 





 679    the deserted garden 



    i mind me in the days departed 

    how often underneath the sun

    with childish bounds i used to run

      to a garden long deserted 



    the beds and walks were vanish’d quite 

    and wheresoe’er had struck the spade 

    the greenest grasses nature laid 

      to sanctify her right 



    i call’d the place my wilderness 

    for no one enter’d there but i 

    the sheep look’d in  the grass to espy 

      and pass’d it ne’ertheless 



    the trees were interwoven wild 

    and spread their boughs enough about

    to keep both sheep and shepherd out 

      but not a happy child 



    adventurous joy it was for me 

    i crept beneath the boughs  and found

    a circle smooth of mossy ground

      beneath a poplar tree 



    old garden rose trees hedged it in 

    bedropt with roses waxen white 

    well satisfied with dew and light 

      and careless to be seen 



    long years ago  it might befall 

    when all the garden flowers were trim 

    the grave old gardener prided him

      on these the most of all 



    some lady  stately overmuch 

    here moving with a silken noise 

    has blush’d beside them at the voice

      that liken’d her to such 



    or these  to make a diadem 

    she often may have pluck’d and twined 

    half smiling as it came to mind 

      that few would look at  them  



    o  little thought that lady proud 

    a child would watch her fair white rose 

    when buried lay her whiter brows 

      and silk was changed for shroud   



    nor thought that gardener  full of scorns

    for men unlearn’d and simple phrase 

    a child would bring it all its praise 

      by creeping through the thorns 



    to me upon my low moss seat 

    though never a dream the roses sent

    of science or love’s compliment 

      i ween they smelt as sweet 



    it did not move my grief to see

    the trace of human step departed 

    because the garden was deserted 

      the blither place for me 



    friends  blame me not  a narrow ken

    hath childhood ’twixt the sun and sward 

    we draw the moral afterward  

      we feel the gladness then 



    and gladdest hours for me did glide

    in silence at the rose tree wall 

    a thrush made gladness musical

      upon the other side 



    nor he nor i did e’er incline

    to peck or pluck the blossoms white   

    how should i know but that they might

      lead lives as glad as mine 



    to make my hermit home complete 

    i brought clear water from the spring

    praised in its own low murmuring 

      and cresses glossy wet 



    and so  i thought  my likeness grew

     without the melancholy tale 

    to ‘gentle hermit of the dale ’

      and angelina too 



    for oft i read within my nook

    such minstrel stories  till the breeze

    made sounds poetic in the trees 

      and then i shut the book 



    if i shut this wherein i write 

    i hear no more the wind athwart

    those trees  nor feel that childish heart

      delighting in delight 



    my childhood from my life is parted 

    my footstep from the moss which drew

    its fairy circle round  anew

      the garden is deserted 



    another thrush may there rehearse

    the madrigals which sweetest are 

    no more for me   myself afar

      do sing a sadder verse 



    ah me  ah me  when erst i lay

    in that child’s nest so greenly wrought 

    i laugh’d unto myself and thought 

      ‘the time will pass away ’



    and still i laugh’d  and did not fear

    but that  whene’er was pass’d away

    the childish time  some happier play

      my womanhood would cheer 



    i knew the time would pass away 

    and yet  beside the rose tree wall 

    dear god  how seldom  if at all 

      did i look up to pray 



    the time is past  and now that grows

    the cypress high among the trees 

    and i behold white sepulchres

      as well as the white rose   



    when wiser  meeker thoughts are given 

    and i have learnt to lift my face 

    reminded how earth’s greenest place

      the colour draws from heaven   



    it something saith for earthly pain 

    but more for heavenly promise free 

    that i who was  would shrink to be

      that happy child again 





 680    consolation 



    all are not taken  there are left behind

    living belovèds  tender looks to bring

      and make the daylight still a happy thing 

    and tender voices  to make soft the wind 

    but if it were not so  if i could find

      no love in all this world for comforting 

      nor any path but hollowly did ring

    where ‘dust to dust’ the love from life disjoin’d 

    and if  before those sepulchres unmoving

      i stood alone  as some forsaken lamb

    goes bleating up the moors in weary dearth 

    crying ‘where are ye  o my loved and loving ’  

      i know a voice would sound  ‘daughter  i am 

    can i suffice for heaven and not for earth ’





 681    grief 



    i tell you  hopeless grief is passionless 

    that only men incredulous of despair 

      half taught in anguish  through the midnight air

    beat upward to god’s throne in loud access

    of shrieking and reproach  full desertness

      in souls as countries lieth silent bare

      under the blanching  vertical eye glare

    of the absolute heavens  deep hearted man  express

    grief for thy dead in silence like to death  

      most like a monumental statue set

    in everlasting watch and moveless woe

    till itself crumble to the dust beneath 

      touch it  the marble eyelids are not wet 

    if it could weep  it could arise and go

    i thought once how theocritus had sung

      of the sweet years  the dear and wish’d for years 

      who each one in a gracious hand appears

    to bear a gift for mortals old or young 

    and  as i mused it in his antique tongue 

      i saw in gradual vision through my tears

      the sweet  sad years  the melancholy years  

    those of my own life  who by turns had flung

    a shadow across me  straightway i was ’ware 

      so weeping  how a mystic shape did move

    behind me  and drew me backward by the hair 

      and a voice said in mastery  while i strove 

    ‘guess now who holds thee ’  ‘death’ i said  but there

      the silver answer rang   not death  but love ’

    unlike are we  unlike  o princely heart 

    unlike our uses and our destinies 

      our ministering two angels look surprise

    on one another  as they strike athwart

    their wings in passing  thou  bethink thee  art

      a guest for queens to social pageantries 

      with gages from a hundred brighter eyes

    than tears even can make mine  to play thy part

    of chief musician  what hast thou to do

      with looking from the lattice lights at me  

    a poor  tired  wandering singer  singing through

      the dark  and leaning up a cypress tree 

    the chrism is on thine head  on mine the dew  

      and death must dig the level where these agree 





 684    iii 



    go from me  yet i feel that i shall stand

    henceforward in thy shadow  nevermore

      alone upon the threshold of my door

    of individual life i shall command

    the uses of my soul  nor lift my hand

      serenely in the sunshine as before 

      without the sense of that which i forbore  

    thy touch upon the palm  the widest land

    doom takes to part us  leaves thy heart in mine

      with pulses that beat double  what i do

    and what i dream include thee  as the wine

      must taste of its own grapes  and when i sue

    god for myself  he hears that name of thine 

      and sees within my eyes the tears of two 





 685    iv 



    if thou must love me  let it be for naught

    except for love’s sake only  do not say 

      ‘i love her for her smile  her look  her way

    of speaking gently   for a trick of thought

    that falls in well with mine  and certes brought

      a sense of pleasant ease on such a day  

      for these things in themselves  belovèd  may

    be changed  or change for thee  and love  so wrought 

    may be unwrought so  neither love me for

      thine own dear pity’s wiping my cheeks dry 

    a creature might forget to weep  who bore

      thy comfort long  and lose thy love thereby 

    but love me for love’s sake  that evermore

      thou mayst love on  through love’s eternity

    when our two souls stand up erect and strong 

    face to face  silent  drawing nigh and nigher 

      until the lengthening wings break into fire

    at either curving point   what bitter wrong

    can the earth do us  that we should not long

      be here contented  think  in mounting higher 

      the angels would press on us  and aspire

    to drop some golden orb of perfect song

    into our deep  dear silence  let us stay

      rather on earth  belovèd  where the unfit

    contrarious moods of men recoil away

      and isolate pure spirits  and permit

    a place to stand and love in for a day 

      with darkness and the death hour rounding it 





 687    a musical instrument 



    what was he doing  the great god pan 

      down in the reeds by the river 

    spreading ruin and scattering ban 

    splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat 

    and breaking the golden lilies afloat

      with the dragon fly on the river 



    he tore out a reed  the great god pan 

      from the deep cool bed of the river 

    the limpid water turbidly ran 

    and the broken lilies a dying lay 

    and the dragon fly had fled away 

      ere he brought it out of the river 



    high on the shore sat the great god pan 

      while turbidly flow’d the river 

    and hack’d and hew’d as a great god can

    with his hard bleak steel at the patient reed 

    till there was not a sign of the leaf indeed

      to prove it fresh from the river 



    he cut it short  did the great god pan

       how tall it stood in the river   

    then drew the pith  like the heart of a man 

    steadily from the outside ring 

    and notch’d the poor dry empty thing

      in holes  as he sat by the river 



    ‘this is the way’ laugh’d the great god pan

      laugh’d while he sat by the river  

    ‘the only way  since gods began

    to make sweet music  they could succeed ’

    then dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed 

      he blew in power by the river 





    sweet  sweet  sweet  o pan 

      piercing sweet by the river 

    blinding sweet  o great god pan 

    the sun on the hill forgot to die 

    and the lilies revived  and the dragon fly

      came back to dream on the river 



    yet half a beast is the great god pan 

      to laugh as he sits by the river 

    making a poet out of a man 

    the true gods sigh for the cost and pain  

    for the reed which grows nevermore again

      as a reed with the reeds of the river

 688    the holy tide 



    the days are sad  it is the holy tide 

      the winter morn is short  the night is long 

    so let the lifeless hours be glorified

      with deathless thoughts and echo’d in sweet song 

    and through the sunset of this purple cup

      they will resume the roses of their prime 

    and the old dead will hear us and wake up 

      pass with dim smiles and make our hearts sublime 



    the days are sad  it is the holy tide 

      be dusky mistletoes and hollies strown 

    sharp as the spear that pierced his sacred side 

      red as the drops upon his thorny crown 

    no haggard passion and no lawless mirth

      fright off the solemn muse   tell sweet old tales 

    sing songs as we sit brooding o’er the hearth 

      till the lamp flickers  and the memory fails

 689    my lost youth 



    often i think of the beautiful town

      that is seated by the sea 

    often in thought go up and down

    the pleasant streets of that dear old town 

      and my youth comes back to me 

        and a verse of a lapland song

        is haunting my memory still 

        ‘a boy’s will is the wind’s will 

    and the thoughts of youth are long  long thoughts ’



    i can see the shadowy lines of its trees 

      and catch  in sudden gleams 

    the sheen of the far surrounding seas 

    and islands that were the hesperides

      of all my boyish dreams 

        and the burden of that old song 

        it murmurs and whispers still 

        ‘a boy’s will is the wind’s will 

    and the thoughts of youth are long  long thoughts ’



    i remember the black wharves and the slips 

      and the sea tides tossing free 

    and spanish sailors with bearded lips 

    and the beauty and mystery of the ships 

      and the magic of the sea 

        and the voice of that wayward song

        is singing and saying still 

        ‘a boy’s will is the wind’s will 

    and the thoughts of youth are long  long thoughts ’





    i remember the bulwarks by the shore 

      and the fort upon the hill 

    the sunrise gun with its hollow roar 

    the drum beat repeated o’er and o’er 

      and the bugle wild and shrill 

        and the music of that old song

        throbs in my memory still 

        ‘a boy’s will is the wind’s will 

    and the thoughts of youth are long  long thoughts ’



    i remember the sea fight far away 

      how it thunder’d o’er the tide 

    and the dead sea captains  as they lay

    in their graves o’erlooking the tranquil bay

      where they in battle died 

        and the sound of that mournful song

        goes through me with a thrill 

        ‘a boy’s will is the wind’s will 

    and the thoughts of youth are long  long thoughts ’



    i can see the breezy dome of groves 

      the shadows of deering’s woods 

    and the friendships old and the early loves

    come back with a sabbath sound  as of doves

      in quiet neighbourhoods 

        and the verse of that sweet old song 

        it flutters and murmurs still 

        ‘a boy’s will is the wind’s will 

    and the thoughts of youth are long  long thoughts ’



    i remember the gleams and glooms that dart

      across the schoolboy’s brain 

    the song and the silence in the heart 

    that in part are prophecies  and in part

      are longings wild and vain 

        and the voice of that fitful song

        sings on  and is never still 

        ‘a boy’s will is the wind’s will 

    and the thoughts of youth are long  long thoughts ’



    there are things of which i may not speak 

      there are dreams that cannot die 

    there are thoughts that make the strong heart weak 

    and bring a pallor into the cheek 

      and a mist before the eye 

        and the words of that fatal song

        come over me like a chill 

        ‘a boy’s will is the wind’s will 

    and the thoughts of youth are long  long thoughts ’



    strange to me now are the forms i meet

      when i visit the dear old town 

    but the native air is pure and sweet 

    and the trees that o’ershadow each well known street 

      as they balance up and down 

        are singing the beautiful song 

        are sighing and whispering still 

        ‘a boy’s will is the wind’s will 

    and the thoughts of youth are long  long thoughts ’



    and deering’s woods are fresh and fair 

      and with joy that is almost pain

    my heart goes back to wander there 

    and among the dreams of the days that were

      i find my lost youth again 

        and the strange and beautiful song 

        the groves are repeating it still 

        ‘a boy’s will is the wind’s will 

    and the thoughts of youth are long  long thoughts ’

    o christ of god  whose life and death

      our own have reconciled 

    most quietly  most tenderly

      take home thy star named child 



    thy grace is in her patient eyes 

      thy words are on her tongue 

    the very silence round her seems

      as if the angels sung 



    her smile is as a listening child’s

      who hears its mother’s call 

    the lilies of thy perfect peace

      about her pillow fall 



    she leans from out our clinging arms

      to rest herself in thine 

    alone to thee  dear lord  can we

      our well beloved resign 



    o  less for her than for ourselves

      we bow our heads and pray 

    her setting star  like bethlehem’s 

      to thee shall point the way

 691    lament of the irish emigrant 



    i’m sittin’ on the stile  mary 

      where we sat side by side

    on a bright may mornin’ long ago 

      when first you were my bride 

    the corn was springin’ fresh and green 

      and the lark sang loud and high  

    and the red was on your lip  mary 

      and the love light in your eye 



    the place is little changed  mary 

      the day is bright as then 

    the lark’s loud song is in my ear 

      and the corn is green again 

    but i miss the soft clasp of your hand 

      and your breath warm on my cheek 

    and i still keep list’ning for the words

      you never more will speak 



    ’tis but a step down yonder lane 

      and the little church stands near 

    the church where we were wed  mary 

      i see the spire from here 

    but the graveyard lies between  mary 

      and my step might break your rest  

    for i’ve laid you  darling  down to sleep 

      with your baby on your breast 





    i’m very lonely now  mary 

      for the poor make no new friends 

    but  o  they love the better still 

      the few our father sends 

    and you were all  i  had  mary 

      my blessin’ and my pride 

    there’s nothin’ left to care for now 

      since my poor mary died 



    yours was the good  brave heart  mary 

      that still kept hoping on 

    when the trust in god had left my soul 

      and my arm’s young strength was gone 

    there was comfort ever on your lip 

      and the kind look on your brow  

    i bless you  mary  for that same 

      though you cannot hear me now 



    i thank you for the patient smile

      when your heart was fit to break 

    when the hunger pain was gnawin’ there 

      and you hid it  for my sake 

    i bless you for the pleasant word 

      when your heart was sad and sore  

    o  i’m thankful you are gone  mary 

      where grief can’t reach you more 



    i’m biddin’ you a long farewell 

      my mary  kind and true 

    but i’ll not forget you  darling 

      in the land i’m goin’ to 

    they say there’s bread and work for all 

      and the sun shines always there  

    but i’ll not forget old ireland 

      were it fifty times as fair 



    and often in those grand old woods

      i’ll sit  and shut my eyes 

    and my heart will travel back again

      to the place where mary lies 

    and i’ll think i see the little stile

      where we sat side by side 

    and the springin’ corn  and the bright may morn 

      when first you were my bride

 692    i do not love thee 



      i do not love thee   no  i do not love thee 

    and yet when thou art absent i am sad 

      and envy even the bright blue sky above thee 

    whose quiet stars may see thee and be glad 



      i do not love thee   yet  i know not why 

    whate’er thou dost seems still well done  to me 

      and often in my solitude i sigh

    that those i do love are not more like thee 



      i do not love thee   yet  when thou art gone 

    i hate the sound  though those who speak be dear 

      which breaks the lingering echo of the tone

    thy voice of music leaves upon my ear 





      i do not love thee   yet thy speaking eyes 

    with their deep  bright  and most expressive blue 

      between me and the midnight heaven arise 

    oftener than any eyes i ever knew 



      i know i do not love thee  yet  alas 

    others will scarcely trust my candid heart 

      and oft i catch them smiling as they pass 

    because they see me gazing where thou art

 693    letty’s globe 



    when letty had scarce pass’d her third glad year 

      and her young artless words began to flow 

    one day we gave the child a colour’d sphere

      of the wide earth  that she might mark and know 

    by tint and outline  all its sea and land 

      she patted all the world  old empires peep’d

    between her baby fingers  her soft hand

      was welcome at all frontiers  how she leap’d 

      and laugh’d and prattled in her world wide bliss 

    but when we turn’d her sweet unlearnèd eye

    on our own isle  she raised a joyous cry  

    ‘oh  yes  i see it  letty’s home is there ’

      and while she hid all england with a kiss 

    bright over europe fell her golden hair

    helen  thy beauty is to me

      like those nicèan barks of yore

    that gently  o’er a perfumed sea 

      the weary way worn wanderer bore

      to his own native shore 



    on desperate seas long wont to roam 

      thy hyacinth hair  thy classic face 

    thy naiad airs have brought me home

      to the glory that was greece 

      and the grandeur that was rome 



    lo  in yon brilliant window niche

      how statue like i see thee stand 

      the agate lamp within thy hand 

    ah  psyche  from the regions which

      are holy land 





 695    annabel lee 



    it was many and many a year ago 

        in a kingdom by the sea 

    that a maiden there lived whom you may know

        by the name of annabel lee 

    and this maiden she lived with no other thought

        than to love and be loved by me 



    i was a child and she was a child

        in this kingdom by the sea 

    but we loved with a love that was more than love  

        i and my annabel lee 

    with a love that the wingèd seraphs of heaven

        coveted her and me 



    and this was the reason that  long ago 

        in this kingdom by the sea 

    a wind blew out of a cloud  chilling

        my beautiful annabel lee 

    so that her high born kinsmen came

        and bore her away from me 

    to shut her up in a sepulchre

        in this kingdom by the sea 



    the angels  not half so happy in heaven 

        went envying her and me  

    yes  that was the reason  as all men know 

        in this kingdom by the sea 

    that the wind came out of the cloud one night 

        chilling and killing my annabel lee 



    but our love it was stronger by far than the love

        of those who were older than we  

        of many far wiser than we  

    and neither the angels in heaven above 

        nor the demons down under the sea 

    can ever dissever my soul from the soul

        of the beautiful annabel lee 



    for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams

        of the beautiful annabel lee 

    and the stars never rise  but i feel the bright eyes

        of the beautiful annabel lee 

    and so  all the night tide  i lie down by the side

    of my darling  my darling  my life and my bride 

        in the sepulchre there by the sea 

        in her tomb by the sounding sea 





 696    for annie 



    thank heaven  the crisis  

      the danger is past 

    and the lingering illness

      is over at last  

    and the fever called ‘living’

      is conquer’d at last 



    sadly  i know

      i am shorn of my strength 

    and no muscle i move

      as i lie at full length 

    but no matter  i feel

      i am better at length 



    and i rest so composedly

      now  in my bed 

    that any beholder

      might fancy me dead  

    might start at beholding me 

      thinking me dead 



    the moaning and groaning 

      the sighing and sobbing 

    are quieted now 

      with that horrible throbbing

    at heart  ah  that horrible 

      horrible throbbing 



    the sickness  the nausea  

      the pitiless pain  

    have ceased  with the fever

      that madden’d my brain  

    with the fever called ‘living’

      that burn’d in my brain 



    and o  of all tortures

      that torture the worst

    has abated  the terrible

      torture of thirst

    for the naphthaline river

      of passion accurst  

    i have drunk of a water

      that quenches all thirst 



      of a water that flows 

      with a lullaby sound 

    from a spring but a very few

      feet under ground  

    from a cavern not very far

      down under ground 



    and ah  let it never

      be foolishly said

    that my room it is gloomy 

      and narrow my bed 

    for man never slept

      in a different bed  

    and  to  sleep   you must slumber

      in just such a bed 



    my tantalized spirit

      here blandly reposes 

    forgetting  or never

      regretting its roses  

    its old agitations

      of myrtles and roses 



    for now  while so quietly

      lying  it fancies

    a holier odour

      about it  of pansies  

    a rosemary odour 

      commingled with pansies  

    with rue and the beautiful

      puritan pansies 



    and so it lies happily 

      bathing in many

    a dream of the truth

      and the beauty of annie  

    drown’d in a bath

      of the tresses of annie 



    she tenderly kiss’d me 

      she fondly caress’d 

    and then i fell gently

      to sleep on her breast  

    deeply to sleep

      from the heaven of her breast 



    when the light was extinguish’d 

      she cover’d me warm 

    and she pray’d to the angels

      to keep me from harm  

    to the queen of the angels

      to shield me from harm 



    and i lie so composedly 

      now  in my bed

     knowing her love  

      that you fancy me dead  

    and i rest so contentedly 

      now  in my bed

     with her love at my breast  

      that you fancy me dead  

    that you shudder to look at me 

      thinking me dead 



    but my heart it is brighter

      than all of the many

    stars in the sky 

      for it sparkles with annie  

    it glows with the light

      of the love of my annie  

    with the thought of the light

      of the eyes of my annie

 697    old song 



    ’tis a dull sight

      to see the year dying 

    when winter winds

      set the yellow wood sighing 

        sighing  o sighing 



    when such a time cometh

      i do retire

    into an old room

      beside a bright fire 

        o  pile a bright fire 



    and there i sit

      reading old things 

    of knights and lorn damsels 

      while the wind sings  

        o  drearily sings 



    i never look out

      nor attend to the blast 

    for all to be seen

      is the leaves falling fast 

        falling  falling 



    but close at the hearth 

      like a cricket  sit i 

    reading of summer

      and chivalry  

        gallant chivalry 



    then with an old friend

      i talk of our youth  

    how ’twas gladsome  but often

      foolish  forsooth 

        but gladsome  gladsome 



    or  to get merry 

      we sing some old rhyme

    that made the wood ring again

      in summer time  

        sweet summer time 



    then go we smoking 

      silent and snug 

    naught passes between us 

      save a brown jug  

        sometimes 



    and sometimes a tear

      will rise in each eye 

    seeing the two old friends

      so merrily  

        so merrily 



    and ere to bed

      go we  go we 

    down on the ashes

      we kneel on the knee 

        praying together 



    thus  then  live i

      till  ’mid all the gloom 

    by heaven  the bold sun

      is with me in the room

        shining  shining 



    then the clouds part 

      swallows soaring between 

    the spring is alive 

      and the meadows are green 



    i jump up like mad 

      break the old pipe in twain 

    and away to the meadows 

      the meadows again 





 698    from omar khayyám 





i



    a book of verses underneath the bough 

    a jug of wine  a loaf of bread  and thou

      beside me singing in the wilderness  

    o  wilderness were paradise enow 



    some for the glories of this world  and some

    sigh for the prophet’s paradise to come 

      ah  take the cash  and let the credit go 

    nor heed the rumble of a distant drum 



    look to the blowing rose about us  ‘lo 

    laughing ’ she says  ‘into the world i blow 

      at once the silken tassel of my purse

    tear  and its treasure on the garden throw ’



    and those who husbanded the golden grain

    and those who flung it to the winds like rain

      alike to no such aureate earth are turn’d

    as  buried once  men want dug up again 





ii



    think  in this batter’d caravanserai

    whose portals are alternate night and day 

      how sultán after sultán with his pomp

    abode his destined hour  and went his way 



    they say the lion and the lizard keep

    the courts where jamshyd gloried and drank deep 

      and bahrám  that great hunter  the wild ass

    stamps o’er his head  but cannot break his sleep 



    i sometimes think that never blows so red

    the rose as where some buried cæsar bled 

      that every hyacinth the garden wears

    dropt in her lap from some once lovely head 



    and this reviving herb whose tender green

    fledges the river lip on which we lean  

      ah  lean upon it lightly  for who knows

    from what once lovely lip it springs unseen 



    ah  my belovèd  fill the cup that clears

    to day of past regrets and future fears 

       to morrow    why  to morrow i may be

    myself with yesterday’s sev’n thousand years 



    for some we loved  the loveliest and the best

    that from his vintage rolling time hath prest 

      have drunk their cup a round or two before 

    and one by one crept silently to rest 



    and we  that now make merry in the room

    they left  and summer dresses in new bloom 

      ourselves must we beneath the couch of earth

    descend  ourselves to make a couch  for whom 



    ah  make the most of what we yet may spend 

    before we too into the dust descend 

      dust unto dust  and under dust to lie 

    sans wine  sans song  sans singer  and  sans end 





iii



    ah  with the grape my fading life provide 

    and wash my body whence the life has died 

      and lay me  shrouded in the living leaf 

    by some not unfrequented garden side    



    yon rising moon that looks for us again  

    how oft hereafter will she wax and wane 

      how oft hereafter rising look for us

    through this same garden  and for  one  in vain 



    and when like her  o sákí  you shall pass

    among the guests star scatter’d on the grass 

      and in your joyous errand reach the spot

    where i made one  turn down an empty glass

 699    mariana 



    with blackest moss the flower plots

      were thickly crusted  one and all 

    the rusted nails fell from the knots

      that held the pear to the gable wall 

    the broken sheds look’d sad and strange 

      unlifted was the clinking latch 

      weeded and worn the ancient thatch

    upon the lonely moated grange 

        she only said  ‘my life is dreary 

          he cometh not ’ she said 

        she said  ‘i am aweary  aweary 

          i would that i were dead ’



    her tears fell with the dews at even 

      her tears fell ere the dews were dried 

    she could not look on the sweet heaven 

      either at morn or eventide 

    after the flitting of the bats 

      when thickest dark did trance the sky 

      she drew her casement curtain by 

    and glanced athwart the glooming flats 

        she only said  ‘the night is dreary 

          he cometh not ’ she said 

        she said  ‘i am aweary  aweary 

          i would that i were dead ’



    upon the middle of the night 

      waking she heard the night fowl crow 

    the cock sung out an hour ere light 

      from the dark fen the oxen’s low

    came to her  without hope of change 

      in sleep she seem’d to walk forlorn 

      till cold winds woke the gray eyed morn

    about the lonely moated grange 

        she only said  ‘the day is dreary 

          he cometh not ’ she said 

        she said  ‘i am aweary  aweary 

          i would that i were dead ’



    about a stone cast from the wall

      a sluice with blacken’d waters slept 

    and o’er it many  round and small 

      the cluster’d marish mosses crept 

    hard by a poplar shook alway 

      all silver green with gnarlèd bark 

      for leagues no other tree did mark

    the level waste  the rounding gray 

        she only said  ‘my life is dreary 

          he cometh not ’ she said 

        she said  ‘i am aweary  aweary 

          i would that i were dead ’



    and ever when the moon was low 

      and the shrill winds were up and away 

    in the white curtain  to and fro 

      she saw the gusty shadow sway 

    but when the moon was very low 

      and wild winds bound within their cell 

      the shadow of the poplar fell

    upon her bed  across her brow 

        she only said  ‘the night is dreary 

          he cometh not ’ she said 

        she said  ‘i am aweary  aweary 

          i would that i were dead ’



    all day within the dreamy house 

      the doors upon their hinges creak’d 

    the blue fly sung in the pane  the mouse

      behind the mouldering wainscot shriek’d 

    or from the crevice peer’d about 

      old faces glimmer’d thro’ the doors 

      old footsteps trod the upper floors 

    old voices call’d her from without 

        she only said  ‘my life is dreary 

          he cometh not ’ she said 

        she said  ‘i am aweary  aweary ’

          i would that i were dead ’



    the sparrow’s chirrup on the roof 

      the slow clock ticking  and the sound

    which to the wooing wind aloof

      the poplar made  did all confound

    her sense  but most she loathed the hour

      when the thick moted sunbeam lay

      athwart the chambers  and the day

    was sloping toward his western bower 

        then  said she  ‘i am very dreary 

          he will not come ’ she said 

        she wept  ‘i am aweary  aweary 

          o god  that i were dead ’

part i



    on either side the river lie

    long fields of barley and of rye 

    that clothe the wold and meet the sky 

    and thro’ the field the road runs by

                to many tower’d camelot 

    and up and down the people go 

    gazing where the lilies blow

    round an island there below 

                the island of shalott 



    willows whiten  aspens quiver 

    little breezes dusk and shiver

    thro’ the wave that runs for ever

    by the island in the river

                flowing down to camelot 

    four gray walls  and four gray towers 

    overlook a space of flowers 

    and the silent isle imbowers

                the lady of shalott 



    by the margin  willow veil’d 

    slide the heavy barges trail’d

    by slow horses  and unhail’d

    the shallop flitteth silken sail’d

                skimming down to camelot 

    but who hath seen her wave her hand 

    or at the casement seen her stand 

    or is she known in all the land 

                the lady of shalott 



    only reapers  reaping early

    in among the bearded barley 

    hear a song that echoes cheerly

    from the river winding clearly 

                down to tower’d camelot 

    and by the moon the reaper weary 

    piling sheaves in uplands airy 

    listening  whispers ‘’tis the fairy

                lady of shalott ’





part ii



    there she weaves by night and day

    a magic web with colours gay 

    she has heard a whisper say 

    a curse is on her if she stay

                to look down to camelot 

    she knows not what the curse may be 

    and so she weaveth steadily 

    and little other care hath she 

                the lady of shalott 



    and moving thro’ a mirror clear

    that hangs before her all the year 

    shadows of the world appear 

    there she sees the highway near

                winding down to camelot 

    there the river eddy whirls 

    and there the surly village churls 

    and the red cloaks of market girls 

                pass onward from shalott 



    sometimes a troop of damsels glad 

    an abbot on an ambling pad 

    sometimes a curly shepherd lad 

    or long hair’d page in crimson clad 

                goes by to tower’d camelot 

    and sometimes thro’ the mirror blue

    the knights come riding two and two 

    she hath no loyal knight and true 

                the lady of shalott 



    but in her web she still delights

    to weave the mirror’s magic sights 

    for often thro’ the silent nights

    a funeral  with plumes and lights 

                and music  went to camelot 

    or when the moon was overhead 

    came two young lovers lately wed 

    ‘i am half sick of shadows ’ said

    a bow shot from her bower eaves

    the sun came dazzling thro’ the leaves 

    and flamed upon the brazen greaves

                of bold sir lancelot 

    a red cross knight for ever kneel’d

    to a lady in his shield 

    that sparkled on the yellow field 

                beside remote shalott 



    the gemmy bridle glitter’d free 

    like to some branch of stars we see

    hung in the golden galaxy 

    the bridle bells rang merrily

                as he rode down to camelot 

    and from his blazon’d baldric slung

    a mighty silver bugle hung 

    and as he rode his armour rung 

                beside remote shalott 



    all in the blue unclouded weather

    thick jewell’d shone the saddle leather 

    the helmet and the helmet feather

    burn’d like one burning flame together 

                as he rode down to camelot 

    as often thro’ the purple night 

    below the starry clusters bright 

    some bearded meteor  trailing light 

                moves over still shalott 



    his broad clear brow in sunlight glow’d 

    on burnish’d hooves his war horse trode 

    from underneath his helmet flow’d

    his coal black curls as on he rode 

                as he rode down to camelot 

    from the bank and from the river

    he flash’d into the crystal mirror 

    ‘tirra lirra ’ by the river

                sang sir lancelot 



    she left the web  she left the loom 

    she made three paces thro’ the room 

    she saw the water lily bloom 

    she saw the helmet and the plume 

                she look’d down to camelot 

    out flew the web and floated wide 

    the mirror crack’d from side to side 

    ‘the curse is come upon me ’ cried

                the lady of shalott 





part iv



    in the stormy east wind straining 

    the pale yellow woods were waning 

    the broad stream in his banks complaining 

    heavily the low sky raining

                over tower’d camelot 

    down she came and found a boat

    beneath a willow left afloat 

    and round about the prow she wrote

                 the lady of shalott  



    and down the river’s dim expanse  

    like some bold seer in a trance 

    seeing all his own mischance  

    with a glassy countenance

                did she look to camelot 

    and at the closing of the day

    she loosed the chain  and down she lay 

    the broad stream bore her far away 

                the lady of shalott 



    lying  robed in snowy white

    that loosely flew to left and right  

    the leaves upon her falling light  

    thro’ the noises of the night

                she floated down to camelot 

    and as the boat head wound along

    the willowy hills and fields among 

    they heard her singing her last song 

                the lady of shalott 



    heard a carol  mournful  holy 

    chanted loudly  chanted lowly 

    till her blood was frozen slowly 

    and her eyes were darkened wholly 

                turn’d to tower’d camelot 

    for ere she reach’d upon the tide

    the first house by the water side 

    singing in her song she died 

                the lady of shalott 



    under tower and balcony 

    by garden wall and gallery 

    a gleaming shape she floated by 

    dead pale between the houses high 

                silent into camelot 

    out upon the wharfs they came 

    knight and burgher  lord and dame 

    and round the prow they read her name 

                 the lady of shalott  



    who is this  and what is here 

    and in the lighted palace near

    died the sound of royal cheer 

    and they cross’d themselves for fear 

                all the knights at camelot 

    but lancelot mused a little space 

    he said  ‘she has a lovely face 

    god in his mercy lend her grace 

                the lady of shalott ’





 701    the miller’s daughter 



    it is the miller’s daughter 

      and she is grown so dear  so dear 

    that i would be the jewel

      that trembles in her ear 

    for hid in ringlets day and night 

    i’d touch her neck so warm and white 



    and i would be the girdle

      about her dainty dainty waist 

    and her heart would beat against me 

      in sorrow and in rest 

    and i should know if it beat right 

    i’d clasp it round so close and tight 



    and i would be the necklace 

      and all day long to fall and rise

    upon her balmy bosom 

      with her laughter or her sighs 

    and i would lie so light  so light 

    i scarce should be unclasp’d at night 





 702    song of the lotos eaters 



    there is sweet music here that softer falls

    than petals from blown roses on the grass 

    or night dews on still waters between walls

    of shadowy granite  in a gleaming pass 

    music that gentlier on the spirit lies 

    than tired eyelids upon tired eyes 

    music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies 

    here are cool mosses deep 

    and thro’ the moss the ivies creep 

    and in the stream the long leaved flowers weep 

    and from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep 



    why are we weigh’d upon with heaviness 

    and utterly consumed with sharp distress 

    while all things else have rest from weariness 

    all things have rest  why should we toil alone 

    we only toil  who are the first of things 

    and make perpetual moan 

    still from one sorrow to another thrown 

    nor ever fold our wings 

    and cease from wanderings 

    nor steep our brows in slumber’s holy balm 

    nor harken what the inner spirit sings 

    ‘there is no joy but calm ’  

    why should we only toil  the roof and crown of things 





    lo  in the middle of the wood 

    the folded leaf is woo’d from out the bud

    with winds upon the branch  and there

    grows green and broad  and takes no care 

    sun steep’d at noon  and in the moon

    nightly dew fed  and turning yellow

    falls  and floats adown the air 

    lo  sweeten’d with the summer light 

    the full juiced apple  waxing over mellow 

    drops in a silent autumn night 

    all its allotted length of days 

    the flower ripens in its place 

    ripens and fades  and falls  and hath no toil 

    fast rooted in the fruitful soil 



    hateful is the dark blue sky 

    vaulted o’er the dark blue sea 

    death is the end of life  ah  why

    should life all labour be 

    let us alone  time driveth onward fast 

    and in a little while our lips are dumb 

    let us alone  what is it that will last 

    all things are taken from us  and become

    portions and parcels of the dreadful past 

    let us alone  what pleasure can we have

    to war with evil  is there any peace

    in ever climbing up the climbing wave 

    all things have rest  and ripen toward the grave

    in silence  ripen  fall and cease 

    give us long rest or death  dark death  or dreamful ease 



    how sweet it were  hearing the downward stream 

    with half shut eyes ever to seem

    falling asleep in a half dream 

    to dream and dream  like yonder amber light 

    which will not leave the myrrh bush on the height 

    to hear each other’s whisper’d speech 

    eating the lotos day by day 

    to watch the crisping ripples on the beach 

    and tender curving lines of creamy spray 

    to lend our hearts and spirits wholly

    to the influence of mild minded melancholy 

    to muse and brood and live again in memory 

    with those old faces of our infancy

    heap’d over with a mound of grass 

    two handfuls of white dust  shut in an urn of brass 



    dear is the memory of our wedded lives 

    and dear the last embraces of our wives

    and their warm tears  but all hath suffer’d change 

    for surely now our household hearths are cold 

    our sons inherit us  our looks are strange 

    and we should come like ghosts to trouble joy 

    or else the island princes over bold

    have eat our substance  and the minstrel sings

    before them of the ten years’ war in troy 

    and our great deeds  as half forgotten things 

    is there confusion in the little isle 

    let what is broken so remain 

    the gods are hard to reconcile 

    ’tis hard to settle order once again 

    there  is  confusion worse than death 

    trouble on trouble  pain on pain 

    long labour unto agèd breath 

    sore task to hearts worn out with many wars

    and eyes grown dim with gazing on the pilot stars 

    but  propt on beds of amaranth and moly 

    how sweet  while warm airs lull us  blowing lowly 

    with half dropt eyelids still 

    beneath a heaven dark and holy 

    to watch the long bright river drawing slowly

    his waters from the purple hill  

    to hear the dewy echoes calling

    from cave to cave thro’ the thick twinèd vine  

    to watch the emerald colour’d water falling

    thro’ many a wov’n acanthus wreath divine 

    only to hear and see the far off sparkling brine 

    only to hear were sweet  stretch’d out beneath the pine 



    the lotos blooms below the barren peak 

    the lotos blows by every winding creek 

    all day the wind breathes low with mellower tone 

    thro’ every hollow cave and alley lone

    round and round the spicy downs the yellow lotos dust is blown 

    we have had enough of action  and of motion we 

    roll’d to starboard  roll’d to larboard  when the surge was seething free 

    where the wallowing monster spouted his foam fountains in the sea 

    let us swear an oath  and keep it with an equal mind 

    in the hollow lotos land to live and lie reclined

    on the hills like gods together  careless of mankind 

    for they lie beside their nectar  and the bolts are hurl’d

    far below them in the valleys  and the clouds are lightly curl’d

    round their golden houses  girdled with the gleaming world 

    where they smile in secret  looking over wasted lands 

    blight and famine  plague and earthquake  roaring deeps and fiery sands 

    clanging fights  and flaming towns  and sinking ships  and praying hands 

    but they smile  they find a music centred in a doleful song

    steaming up  a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong 

    like a tale of little meaning tho’ the words are strong 

    chanted from an ill used race of men that cleave the soil 

    sow the seed  and reap the harvest with enduring toil 

    storing yearly little dues of wheat  and wine and oil 

    till they perish and they suffer  some  ’tis whisper’d  down in hell

    suffer endless anguish  others in elysian valleys dwell 

    resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel 

    surely  surely  slumber is more sweet than toil  the shore

    than labour in the deep mid ocean  wind and wave and oar 

    o rest ye  brother mariners  we will not wander more 





 703    st  agnes’ eve 



    deep on the convent roof the snows

      are sparkling to the moon 

    my breath to heaven like vapour goes 

      may my soul follow soon 

    the shadows of the convent towers

      slant down the snowy sward 

    still creeping with the creeping hours

      that lead me to my lord 

    make thou my spirit pure and clear

      as are the frosty skies 

    or this first snowdrop of the year

      that in my bosom lies 



    as these white robes are soil’d and dark 

      to yonder shining ground 

    as this pale taper’s earthly spark 

      to yonder argent round 

    so shows my soul before the lamb 

      my spirit before thee 

    so in mine earthly house i am 

      to that i hope to be 

    break up the heavens  o lord  and far 

      thro’ all yon starlight keen 

    draw me  thy bride  a glittering star 

      in raiment white and clean 



    he lifts me to the golden doors 

      the flashes come and go 

    all heaven bursts her starry floors 

      and strows her lights below 

    and deepens on and up  the gates

      roll back  and far within

    for me the heavenly bridegroom waits 

      to make me pure of sin 

    the sabbaths of eternity 

      one sabbath deep and wide  

    a light upon the shining sea  

      the bridegroom with his bride 





 704    blow  bugle  blow 



        the splendour falls on castle walls

          and snowy summits old in story 

        the long light shakes across the lakes 

          and the wild cataract leaps in glory 

    blow  bugle  blow  set the wild echoes flying 

    blow  bugle  answer  echoes  dying  dying  dying 





        o hark  o hear  how thin and clear 

          and thinner  clearer  farther going 

        o sweet and far from cliff and scar

          the horns of elfland faintly blowing 

    blow  let us hear the purple glens replying 

    blow  bugle  answer  echoes  dying  dying  dying 



        o love  they die in yon rich sky 

          they faint on hill or field or river 

        our echoes roll from soul to soul 

          and grow for ever and for ever 

    blow  bugle  blow  set the wild echoes flying 

    and answer  echoes  answer  dying  dying  dying 





 705    summer night 



    now sleeps the crimson petal  now the white 

    nor waves the cypress in the palace walk 

    nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font 

    the firefly wakens  waken thou with me 



      now droops the milk white peacock like a ghost 

    and like a ghost she glimmers on to me 



      now lies the earth all danaë to the stars 

    and all thy heart lies open unto me 



      now slides the silent meteor on  and leaves

    a shining furrow  as thy thoughts in me 



      now folds the lily all her sweetness up 

    and slips into the bosom of the lake 

    so fold thyself  my dearest  thou  and slip

    into my bosom and be lost in me 





 706    come down  o maid 



    come down  o maid  from yonder mountain height 

    what pleasure lives in height  the shepherd sang  

    in height and cold  the splendour of the hills 

    but cease to move so near the heavens  and cease

    to glide a sunbeam by the blasted pine 

    to sit a star upon the sparkling spire 

    and come  for love is of the valley  come 

    for love is of the valley  come thou down

    and find him  by the happy threshold  he 

    or hand in hand with plenty in the maize 

    or red with spirted purple of the vats 

    or foxlike in the vine  nor cares to walk

    with death and morning on the silver horns 

    nor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine 

    nor find him dropt upon the firths of ice 

    that huddling slant in furrow cloven falls

    to roll the torrent out of dusky doors 

    but follow  let the torrent dance thee down

    to find him in the valley  let the wild

    lean headed eagles yelp alone  and leave

    the monstrous ledges there to slope  and spill

    their thousand wreaths of dangling water smoke 

    that like a broken purpose waste in air 

    so waste not thou  but come  for all the vales

    await thee  azure pillars of the hearth

    arise to thee  the children call  and i

    thy shepherd pipe  and sweet is every sound 

    sweeter thy voice  but every sound is sweet 

    myriads of rivulets hurrying thro’ the lawn 

    the moan of doves in immemorial elms 

    and murmuring of innumerable bees 





 707    from ‘in memoriam’ 



 arthur henry hallam  mdcccxxxiii 





i



    fair ship  that from the italian shore

        sailest the placid ocean plains

        with my lost arthur’s loved remains 

    spread thy full wings  and waft him o’er 



    so draw him home to those that mourn

        in vain  a favourable speed

        ruffle thy mirror’d mast  and lead

    thro’ prosperous floods his holy urn 



    all night no ruder air perplex

        thy sliding keel  till phosphor  bright

        as our pure love  thro’ early light

    shall glimmer on the dewy decks 



    sphere all your lights around  above 

        sleep  gentle heavens  before the prow 

        sleep  gentle winds  as he sleeps now 

    my friend  the brother of my love 



    my arthur  whom i shall not see

        till all my widow’d race be run 

        dear as the mother to the son 

    more than my brothers are to me 





ii



    i hear the noise about thy keel 

        i hear the bell struck in the night 

        i see the cabin window bright 

    i see the sailor at the wheel 





    thou bring’st the sailor to his wife 

        and travell’d men from foreign lands 

        and letters unto trembling hands 

    and  thy dark freight  a vanish’d life 



    so bring him  we have idle dreams 

        this look of quiet flatters thus

        our home bred fancies  o to us 

    the fools of habit  sweeter seems



    to rest beneath the clover sod 

        that takes the sunshine and the rains 

        or where the kneeling hamlet drains

    the chalice of the grapes of god 



    than if with thee the roaring wells

        should gulf him fathom deep in brine 

        and hands so often clasp’d in mine 

    should toss with tangle and with shells 





iii



    calm is the morn without a sound 

        calm as to suit a calmer grief 

        and only thro’ the faded leaf

    the chestnut pattering to the ground 



    calm and deep peace on this high wold 

        and on these dews that drench the furze 

        and all the silvery gossamers

    that twinkle into green and gold 



    calm and still light on yon great plain

        that sweeps with all its autumn bowers 

        and crowded farms and lessening towers 

    to mingle with the bounding main 





    calm and deep peace in this wide air 

        these leaves that redden to the fall 

        and in my heart  if calm at all 

    if any calm  a calm despair 



    calm on the seas  and silver sleep 

        and waves that sway themselves in rest 

        and dead calm in that noble breast

    which heaves but with the heaving deep 





iv



    to night the winds begin to rise

        and roar from yonder dropping day 

        the last red leaf is whirl’d away 

    the rooks are blown about the skies 



    the forest crack’d  the waters curl’d 

        the cattle huddled on the lea 

        and wildly dash’d on tower and tree

    the sunbeam strikes along the world 



    and but for fancies  which aver

        that all thy motions gently pass

        athwart a plane of molten glass 

    i scarce could brook the strain and stir



    that makes the barren branches loud 

        and but for fear it is not so 

        the wild unrest that lives in woe

    would dote and pore on yonder cloud



    that rises upward always higher 

        and onward drags a labouring breast 

        and topples round the dreary west 

    a looming bastion fringed with fire 





v



    thou comest  much wept for  such a breeze

        compell’d thy canvas  and my prayer

        was as the whisper of an air

    to breathe thee over lonely seas 



    for i in spirit saw thee move

        thro’ circles of the bounding sky 

        week after week  the days go by 

    come quick  thou bringest all i love 



    henceforth  wherever thou mayst roam

        my blessing  like a line of light 

        is on the waters day and night 

    and like a beacon guards thee home 



    so may whatever tempest mars

        mid ocean  spare thee  sacred bark 

        and balmy drops in summer dark

    slide from the bosom of the stars 



    so kind an office hath been done 

        such precious relics brought by thee 

        the dust of him i shall not see

    till all my widow’d race be run 





vi



    now  sometimes in my sorrow shut 

        or breaking into song by fits 

        alone  alone  to where he sits 

    the shadow cloak’d from head to foot 



    who keeps the keys of all the creeds 

        i wander  often falling lame 

        and looking back to whence i came 

    or on to where the pathway leads 

    and crying  how changed from where it ran

        thro’ lands where not a leaf was dumb 

        but all the lavish hills would hum

    the murmur of a happy pan 



    when each by turns was guide to each 

        and fancy light from fancy caught 

        and thought leapt out to wed with thought

    ere thought could wed itself with speech 



    and all we met was fair and good 

        and all was good that time could bring 

        and all the secret of the spring

    moved in the chambers of the blood 



    and many an old philosophy

        on argive heights divinely sang 

        and round us all the thicket rang

    to many a flute of arcady 





vii



    how fares it with the happy dead 

        for here the man is more and more 

        but he forgets the days before

    god shut the doorways of his head 



    the days have vanish’d  tone and tint 

        and yet perhaps the hoarding sense

        gives out at times  he knows not whence 

    a little flash  a mystic hint 



    and in the long harmonious years

         if death so taste lethean springs 

        may some dim touch of earthly things

    surprise thee ranging with thy peers 





    if such a dreamy touch should fall 

        o turn thee round  resolve the doubt 

        my guardian angel will speak out

    in that high place  and tell thee all 





viii



    the wish  that of the living whole

        no life may fail beyond the grave 

        derives it not from what we have

    the likest god within the soul 



    are god and nature then at strife 

        that nature lends such evil dreams 

        so careful of the type she seems 

    so careless of the single life 



    that i  considering everywhere

        her secret meaning in her deeds 

        and finding that of fifty seeds

    she often brings but one to bear 



    i falter where i firmly trod 

        and falling with my weight of cares

        upon the great world’s altar stairs

    that slope thro’ darkness up to god 



    i stretch lame hands of faith  and grope 

        and gather dust and chaff  and call

        to what i feel is lord of all 

    and faintly trust the larger hope 





ix



    ‘so careful of the type ’ but no 

        from scarpèd cliff and quarried stone

        she cries  ‘a thousand types are gone

    i care for nothing  all shall go 





    thou makest thine appeal to me 

        i bring to life  i bring to death 

        the spirit does but mean the breath 

    i know no more ’ and he  shall he 



    man  her last work  who seem’d so fair 

        such splendid purpose in his eyes 

        who roll’d the psalm to wintry skies 

    who built him fanes of fruitless prayer 



    who trusted god was love indeed

        and love creation’s final law  

        tho’ nature  red in tooth and claw

    with ravine  shriek’d against his creed  



    who loved  who suffer’d countless ills 

        who battled for the true  the just 

        be blown about the desert dust 

    or seal’d within the iron hills 



    no more  a monster then  a dream 

        a discord  dragons of the prime 

        that tare each other in their slime 

    were mellow music matched with him 



    o life as futile  then as frail 

        o for thy voice to soothe and bless 

        what hope of answer  or redress 

    behind the veil  behind the veil

    unwatch’d  the garden bough shall sway 

        the tender blossom flutter down 

        unloved  that beech will gather brown 

    this maple burn itself away 

    unloved  the sunflower  shining fair 

        ray round with flames her disk of seed 

        and many a rose carnation feed

    with summer spice the humming air 



    unloved  by many a sandy bar 

        the brook shall babble down the plain 

        at noon or when the lesser wain

    is twisting round the polar star 



    uncared for  gird the windy grove 

        and flood the haunts of hern and crake 

        or into silver arrows break

    the sailing moon in creek and cove 



    till from the garden and the wild

        a fresh association blow 

        and year by year the landscape grow

    familiar to the stranger’s child 



    as year by year the labourer tills

        his wonted glebe  or lops the glades 

        and year by year our memory fades

    from all the circle of the hills

    now fades the last long streak of snow 

        now burgeons every maze of quick

        about the flowering squares  and thick

    by ashen roots the violets blow 



    now rings the woodland loud and long 

        the distance takes a lovelier hue 

        and drown’d in yonder living blue

    the lark becomes a sightless song 





    now dance the lights on lawn and lea 

        the flocks are whiter down the vale 

        and milkier every milky sail

    on winding stream or distant sea 



    where now the seamew pipes  or dives

        in yonder greening gleam  and fly

        the happy birds  that change their sky

    to build and brood  that live their lives



    from land to land  and in my breast

        spring wakens too  and my regret

        becomes an april violet 

    and buds and blossoms like the rest

    love is and was my lord and king 

        and in his presence i attend

        to hear the tidings of my friend 

    which every hour his couriers bring 



    love is and was my king and lord 

        and will be  tho’ as yet i keep

        within his court on earth  and sleep

    encompass’d by his faithful guard 



    and hear at times a sentinel

        who moves about from place to place 

        and whispers to the worlds of space 

    in the deep night  that all is well 





 708    maud 



    come into the garden  maud 

      for the black bat  night  has flown 

    come into the garden  maud 

      i am here at the gate alone 

    and the woodbine spices are wafted abroad 

      and the musk of the roses blown 



    for a breeze of morning moves 

      and the planet of love is on high 

    beginning to faint in the light that she loves

      on a bed of daffodil sky 

    to faint in the light of the sun she loves 

      to faint in his light  and to die 



    all night have the roses heard

      the flute  violin  bassoon 

    all night has the casement jessamine stirr’d

      to the dancers dancing in tune 

    till a silence fell with the waking bird 

      and a hush with the setting moon 



    i said to the lily  ‘there is but one

      with whom she has heart to be gay 

    when will the dancers leave her alone 

      she is weary of dance and play ’

    now half to the setting moon are gone 

      and half to the rising day 

    low on the sand and loud on the stone

      the last wheel echoes away 



    i said to the rose  ‘the brief night goes

      in babble and revel and wine 





    o young lord lover  what sighs are those

      for one that will never be thine 

    but mine  but mine ’ so i sware to the rose 

      ‘for ever and ever  mine ’



    and the soul of the rose went into my blood 

      as the music clash’d in the hall 

    and long by the garden lake i stood 

      for i heard your rivulet fall

    from the lake to the meadow and on to the wood 

      our wood  that is dearer than all 



    from the meadow your walks have left so sweet

      that whenever a march wind sighs

    he sets the jewel print of your feet

      in violets blue as your eyes 

    to the woody hollows in which we meet

      and the valleys of paradise 



    the slender acacia would not shake

      one long milk bloom on the tree 

    the white lake blossom fell into the lake 

      as the pimpernel dozed on the lea 

    but the rose was awake all night for your sake 

      knowing your promise to me 

    the lilies and roses were all awake 

      they sigh’d for the dawn and thee 



    queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls 

      come hither  the dances are done 

    in gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls 

      queen lily and rose in one 

    shine out  little head  sunning over with curls 

      to the flowers  and be their sun 





    there has fallen a splendid tear

      from the passion flower at the gate 

    she is coming  my dove  my dear 

      she is coming  my life  my fate 

    the red rose cries  ‘she is near  she is near ’

      and the white rose weeps  ‘she is late ’

    the larkspur listens  ‘i hear  i hear ’

      and the lily whispers  ‘i wait ’



    she is coming  my own  my sweet 

      were it ever so airy a tread 

    my heart would hear her and beat 

      were it earth in an earthy bed 

    my dust would hear her and beat 

      had i lain for a century dead 

    would start and tremble under her feet 

      and blossom in purple and red 





 709    o that ’twere possible 



    o that ’twere possible

    after long grief and pain

    to find the arms of my true love

    round me once again    



    a shadow flits before me 

    not thou  but like to thee 

    ah  christ  that it were possible

    for one short hour to see

    the souls we loved  that they might tell us

    what and where they be

    they seem’d  to those who saw them meet 

      the casual friends of every day 

    her smile was undisturb’d and sweet 

      his courtesy was free and gay 



    but yet if one the other’s name

      in some unguarded moment heard 

    the heart you thought so calm and tame

      would struggle like a captured bird 



    and letters of mere formal phrase

      were blister’d with repeated tears   

    and this was not the work of days 

      but had gone on for years and years 



    alas  that love was not too strong

      for maiden shame and manly pride 

    alas  that they delay’d so long

     the goal of mutual bliss beside 



    yet what no chance could then reveal 

      and neither would be first to own 

    let fate and courage now conceal 

      when truth could bring remorse alone

    ‘rise ’ said the master  ‘come unto the feast ’

      she heard the call and rose with willing feet 

      but thinking it not otherwise than meet

    for such a bidding to put on her best 

    she is gone from us for a few short hours

      into her bridal closet  there to wait

      for the unfolding of the palace gate

    that gives her entrance to the blissful bowers 

    we have not seen her yet  though we have been

      full often to her chamber door  and oft

    have listen’d underneath the postern green 

      and laid fresh flowers  and whisper’d short and soft 

    but she hath made no answer  and the day

    from the clear west is fading fast away

 715    song from ‘paracelsus’ 



    heap cassia  sandal buds and stripes

      of labdanum  and aloe balls 

    smear’d with dull nard an indian wipes

      from out her hair  such balsam falls

      down sea side mountain pedestals 

    from tree tops where tired winds are fain 

    spent with the vast and howling main 

    to treasure half their island gain 



    and strew faint sweetness from some old

      egyptian’s fine worm eaten shroud

    which breaks to dust when once unroll’d 

      or shredded perfume  like a cloud

      from closet long to quiet vow’d 

    with moth’d and dropping arras hung 

    mouldering her lute and books among 

    as when a queen  long dead  was young 





 716    the wanderers 



    over the sea our galleys went 

      with cleaving prows in order brave

    to a speeding wind and a bounding wave  

      a gallant armament 

    each bark built out of a forest tree

      left leafy and rough as first it grew 

    and nail’d all over the gaping sides 

    within and without  with black bull hides 

    seethed in fat and suppled in flame 

    to bear the playful billows’ game 

    so  each good ship was rude to see 

    rude and bare to the outward view 

      but each upbore a stately tent

    where cedar pales in scented row

    kept out the flakes of the dancing brine 

    and an awning droop’d the mast below 

    in fold on fold of the purple fine 

    that neither noontide nor star shine

    nor moonlight cold which maketh mad 

      might pierce the regal tenement 

    when the sun dawn’d  o  gay and glad

    we set the sail and plied the oar 

    but when the night wind blew like breath 

    for joy of one day’s voyage more 

    we sang together on the wide sea 

    like men at peace on a peaceful shore 

    each sail was loosed to the wind so free 

    each helm made sure by the twilight star 

    and in a sleep as calm as death 

    we  the voyagers from afar 

      lay stretch’d along  each weary crew

    in a circle round its wondrous tent

    whence gleam’d soft light and curl’d rich scent 

      and with light and perfume  music too 

    so the stars wheel’d round  and the darkness past 

    and at morn we started beside the mast 

    and still each ship was sailing fast 



    now  one morn  land appear’d  a speck

    dim trembling betwixt sea and sky  

    ‘avoid it ’ cried our pilot  ‘check

      the shout  restrain the eager eye ’

    but the heaving sea was black behind

    for many a night and many a day 

    and land  though but a rock  drew nigh

    so we broke the cedar pales away 

    let the purple awning flap in the wind 

      and a statue bright was on every deck 

    we shouted  every man of us 

    and steer’d right into the harbour thus 

    with pomp and pæan glorious 



    a hundred shapes of lucid stone 

      all day we built its shrine for each 

    a shrine of rock for every one 

    nor paused till in the westering sun

      we sat together on the beach

    to sing because our task was done 

    when lo  what shouts and merry songs 

    what laughter all the distance stirs 

    a loaded raft with happy throngs

    of gentle islanders 

    ‘our isles are just at hand ’ they cried 

      ‘like cloudlets faint in even sleeping 

    our temple gates are open’d wide 

      our olive groves thick shade are keeping

    for these majestic forms’  they cried 

    o  then we awoke with sudden start

    from our deep dream  and knew  too late 

    how bare the rock  how desolate 

    which had received our precious freight 

      yet we call’d out  ‘depart 

    our gifts  once given  must here abide 

      our work is done  we have no heart

    to mar our work ’  we cried 





 717    thus the mayne glideth 



    thus the mayne glideth

    where my love abideth 

    sleep’s no softer  it proceeds

    on through lawns  on through meads 

    on and on  whate’er befall 

    meandering and musical 

    though the niggard pasturage

    bears not on its shaven ledge

    aught but weeds and waving grasses

    to view the river as it passes 

    save here and there a scanty patch

    of primroses too faint to catch

    a weary bee     and scarce it pushes

    its gentle way through strangling rushes

    where the glossy kingfisher

    flutters when noon heats are near 

    glad the shelving banks to shun 

    red and steaming in the sun 

    where the shrew mouse with pale throat

    burrows  and the speckled stoat 

    where the quick sandpipers flit

    in and out the marl and grit

    that seems to breed them  brown as they 

    naught disturbs its quiet way 

    save some lazy stork that springs 

    trailing it with legs and wings 

    whom the shy fox from the hill

    rouses  creep he ne’er so still 





 718    pippa’s song 



    the year’s at the spring 

    and day’s at the morn 

    morning’s at seven 

    the hill side’s dew pearl’d 

    the lark’s on the wing 

    the snail’s on the thorn 

    god’s in his heaven  

    all’s right with the world 





 719    you’ll love me yet 



    you’ll love me yet   and i can tarry

      your love’s protracted growing 

    june rear’d that bunch of flowers you carry 

      from seeds of april’s sowing 



    i plant a heartful now  some seed

      at least is sure to strike 

    and yield  what you’ll not pluck indeed 

      not love  but  may be  like 



    you’ll look at least on love’s remains 

      a grave’s one violet 

    your look   that pays a thousand pains 

      what’s death  you’ll love me yet 





 720    porphyria’s lover 



    the rain set early in to night 

      the sullen wind was soon awake 

    it tore the elm tops down for spite 

      and did its worst to vex the lake 

      i listen’d with heart fit to break 

    when glided in porphyria  straight

      she shut the cold out and the storm 

    and kneel’d and made the cheerless grate

      blaze up  and all the cottage warm 

      which done  she rose  and from her form

    withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl 

      and laid her soil’d gloves by  untied

    her hat and let the damp hair fall 

      and  last  she sat down by my side

      and call’d me  when no voice replied 

    she put my arm about her waist 

      and made her smooth white shoulder bare 

    and all her yellow hair displaced 

      and  stooping  made my cheek lie there 

      and spread  o’er all  her yellow hair 

    murmuring how she loved me  she

      too weak  for all her heart’s endeavour 

    to set its struggling passion free

      from pride  and vainer ties dissever 

      and give herself to me for ever 

    but passion sometimes would prevail 

      nor could to night’s gay feast restrain

    a sudden thought of one so pale

      for love of her  and all in vain 

      so  she was come through wind and rain 

    be sure i look’d up at her eyes

      happy and proud  at last i knew

    porphyria worshipp’d me  surprise

      made my heart swell  and still it grew

      while i debated what to do 

    that moment she was mine  mine  fair 

      perfectly pure and good  i found

    a thing to do  and all her hair

      in one long yellow string i wound

      three times her little throat around 

    and strangled her  no pain felt she 

      i am quite sure she felt no pain 

    as a shut bud that holds a bee 

      i warily oped her lids  again

      laugh’d the blue eyes without a stain 

    and i untighten’d next the tress

      about her neck  her cheek once more

    blush’d bright beneath my burning kiss 

      i propp’d her head up as before 

      only  this time my shoulder bore

    her head  which droops upon it still 

      the smiling rosy little head 

    so glad it has its utmost will 

      that all it scorn’d at once is fled 

      and i  its love  am gain’d instead 

    porphyria’s love  she guess’d not how

      her darling one wish would be heard 

    and thus we sit together now 

      and all night long we have not stirr’d 

      and yet god has not said a word 





 721    song 



    nay but you  who do not love her 

    is she not pure gold  my mistress 

    holds earth aught  speak truth  above her 

      aught like this tress  see  and this tress 

    and this last fairest tress of all 

    so fair  see  ere i let it fall 





    because  you spend your lives in praising 

      to praise  you search the wide world over 

    then why not witness  calmly gazing 

      if earth holds aught  speak truth  above her 

    above this tress  and this  i touch

    but cannot praise  i love so much 





 722    earl mertoun’s song 



    there’s a woman like a dewdrop  she’s so purer than the purest 

    and her noble heart’s the noblest  yes  and her sure faith’s the surest 

    and her eyes are dark and humid  like the depth on depth of lustre

    hid i’ the harebell  while her tresses  sunnier than the wild grape cluster 

    gush in golden tinted plenty down her neck’s rose misted marble 

    then her voice’s music     call it the well’s bubbling  the bird’s warble 



    and this woman says  ‘my days were sunless and my nights were moonless 

    parch’d the pleasant april herbage  and the lark’s heart’s outbreak tuneless 

    if you loved me not ’ and i who  ah  for words of flame   adore her 

    who am mad to lay my spirit prostrate palpably before her  

    i may enter at her portal soon  as now her lattice takes me 

    and by noontide as by midnight make her mine  as hers she makes me 





 723    in a gondola 



    the moth’s kiss  first 

    kiss me as if you made me believe

    you were not sure  this eve 

    how my face  your flower  had pursed

    its petals up  so  here and there

    you brush it  till i grow aware

    who wants me  and wide ope i burst 



    the bee’s kiss  now 

    kiss me as if you enter’d gay

    my heart at some noonday 

    a bud that dares not disallow

    the claim  so all is render’d up 

    and passively its shatter’d cup

    over your head to sleep i bow 





 724    meeting at night 



    the gray sea and the long black land 

    and the yellow half moon large and low 

    and the startled little waves that leap

    in fiery ringlets from their sleep 

    as i gain the cove with pushing prow 

    and quench its speed i’ the slushy sand 



    then a mile of warm sea scented beach 

    three fields to cross till a farm appears 

    a tap at the pane  the quick sharp scratch

    and blue spurt of a lighted match 

    and a voice less loud  thro’ its joys and fears 

    than the two hearts beating each to each 





 725    parting at morning 



    round the cape of a sudden came the sea 

    and the sun look’d over the mountain’s rim

    and straight was a path of gold for him 

    and the need of a world of men for me 





 726    the lost mistress 



    all’s over  then  does truth sound bitter

      as one at first believes 

    hark  ’tis the sparrows’ good night twitter

      about your cottage eaves 



    and the leaf buds on the vine are woolly 

      i noticed that  to day 

    one day more bursts them open fully

      you know the red turns gray 



    to morrow we meet the same then  dearest 

      may i take your hand in mine 

    mere friends are we   well  friends the merest

      keep much that i resign 



    for each glance of the eye so bright and black 

      though i keep with heart’s endeavour   

    your voice  when you wish the snowdrops back 

      though it stay in my soul for ever   



    yet i will but say what mere friends say 

      or only a thought stronger 

    i will hold your hand but as long as all may 

      or so very little longer 





 727    the last ride together 



    i said  then  dearest  since ’tis so 

    since now at length my fate i know 

    since nothing all my love avails 

    since all  my life seem’d meant for  fails 

      since this was written and needs must be  

    my whole heart rises up to bless

    your name in pride and thankfulness 

    take back the hope you gave   i claim

    only a memory of the same 

      and this beside  if you will not blame 

      your leave for one more last ride with me 



    my mistress bent that brow of hers 

    those deep dark eyes where pride demurs

    when pity would be softening through 

    fix’d me a breathing while or two

      with life or death in the balance  right 

    the blood replenish’d me again 

    my last thought was at least not vain 

    i and my mistress  side by side

    shall be together  breathe and ride 

    so  one day more am i deified 

      who knows but the world may end to night 



    hush  if you saw some western cloud

    all billowy bosom’d  over bow’d

    by many benedictions  sun’s

    and moon’s and evening star’s at once  

      and so  you  looking and loving best 

    conscious grew  your passion drew

    cloud  sunset  moonrise  star shine too 

    down on you  near and yet more near 

    till flesh must fade for heaven was here   

    thus leant she and linger’d  joy and fear 

      thus lay she a moment on my breast 



    then we began to ride  my soul

    smooth’d itself out  a long cramp’d scroll

    freshening and fluttering in the wind 

    past hopes already lay behind 

      what need to strive with a life awry 

    had i said that  had i done this 

    so might i gain  so might i miss 

    might she have loved me  just as well

    she might have hated  who can tell 

    where had i been now if the worst befell 

      and here we are riding  she and i 



    fail i alone  in words and deeds 

    why  all men strive and who succeeds 

    we rode  it seem’d my spirit flew 

    saw other regions  cities new 

      as the world rush’d by on either side 

    i thought   all labour  yet no less

    bear up beneath their unsuccess 

    look at the end of work  contrast

    the petty done  the undone vast 

    this present of theirs with the hopeful past 

      i hoped she would love me  here we ride 



    what hand and brain went ever pair’d 

    what heart alike conceived and dared 

    what act proved all its thought had been 

    what will but felt the fleshly screen 

      we ride and i see her bosom heave 

    there’s many a crown for who can reach 

    ten lines  a statesman’s life in each 

    the flag stuck on a heap of bones 

    a soldier’s doing  what atones 

    they scratch his name on the abbey stones 

      my riding is better  by their leave 



    what does it all mean  poet  well 

    your brains beat into rhythm  you tell

    what we felt only  you express’d

    you hold things beautiful the best 

      and pace them in rhyme so  side by side 

    ’tis something  nay ’tis much  but then 

    have you yourself what’s best for men 

    are you  poor  sick  old ere your time  

    nearer one whit your own sublime

    than we who never have turn’d a rhyme 

      sing  riding’s a joy  for me  i ride 



    and you  great sculptor  so  you gave

    a score of years to art  her slave 

    and that’s your venus  whence we turn

    to yonder girl that fords the burn 

      you acquiesce  and shall i repine 

    what  man of music  you grown gray

    with notes and nothing else to say 

    is this your sole praise from a friend 

    ‘greatly his opera’s strains intend 

    but in music we know how fashions end ’

      i gave my youth  but we ride  in fine 



    who knows what’s fit for us  had fate

    proposed bliss here should sublimate

    my being  had i sign’d the bond  

    still one must lead some life beyond 

      have a bliss to die with  dim descried 

    this foot once planted on the goal 

    this glory garland round my soul 

    could i descry such  try and test 

    i sink back shuddering from the quest 

    earth being so good  would heaven seem best 

      now  heaven and she are beyond this ride 



    and yet  she has not spoke so long 

    what if heaven be that  fair and strong

    at life’s best  with our eyes upturn’d

    whither life’s flower is first discern’d 

      we  fix’d so  ever should so abide 

    what if we still ride on  we two

    with life for ever old yet new 

    changed not in kind but in degree 

    the instant made eternity   

    and heaven just prove that i and she

      ride  ride together  for ever ride

        this is a spray the bird clung to 

          making it blossom with pleasure 

        ere the high tree top she sprung to 

          fit for her nest and her treasure 

          o  what a hope beyond measure

    was the poor spray’s  which the flying feet hung to   

    so to be singled out  built in  and sung to 





        this is a heart the queen leant on 

          thrill’d in a minute erratic 

        ere the true bosom she bent on 

          meet for love’s regal dalmatic 

          o  what a fancy ecstatic

    was the poor heart’s  ere the wanderer went on  

    love to be saved for it  proffer’d to  spent on 





 729    home thoughts  from abroad 



    o to be in england

    now that april’s there 

    and whoever wakes in england

    sees  some morning  unaware 

    that the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheaf

    round the elm tree bole are in tiny leaf 

    while the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough

    in england  now 



    and after april  when may follows 

    and the whitethroat builds  and all the swallows 

    hark  where my blossom’d pear tree in the hedge

    leans to the field and scatters on the clover

    blossoms and dewdrops  at the bent spray’s edge  

    that’s the wise thrush  he sings each song twice over 

    lest you should think he never could recapture

    the first fine careless rapture 

    and though the fields look rough with hoary dew 

    all will be gay when noontide wakes anew

    the buttercups  the little children’s dower

      far brighter than this gaudy melon flower

 731    the witch’s ballad 



    o i hae come from far away 

      from a warm land far away 

    a southern land across the sea 

    with sailor lads about the mast 

    merry and canny  and kind to me 



    and i hae been to yon town

      to try my luck in yon town 

    nort  and mysie  elspie too 

    right braw we were to pass the gate 

    wi’ gowden clasps on girdles blue 



    mysie smiled wi’ miminy mouth 

      innocent mouth  miminy mouth 



      731   miminy  prim  demure 



    elspie wore a scarlet gown 

    nort’s grey eyes were unco’ gleg 

    my castile comb was like a crown 



    we walk’d abreast all up the street 

      into the market up the street 

    our hair with marigolds was wound 

    our bodices with love knots laced 

    our merchandise with tansy bound 



    nort had chickens  i had cocks 

      gamesome cocks  loud crowing cocks 

    mysie ducks  and elspie drakes   

    for a wee groat or a pound 

    we lost nae time wi’ gives and takes 



      lost nae time  for well we knew 

      in our sleeves full well we knew 

    when the gloaming came that night 

    duck nor drake  nor hen nor cock

    would be found by candle light 



    and when our chaffering all was done 

      all was paid for  sold and done 

    we drew a glove on ilka hand 

    we sweetly curtsied  each to each 

    and deftly danced a saraband 



    the market lassies look’d and laugh’d 

      left their gear  and look’d and laugh’d 

    they made as they would join the game 

    but soon their mithers  wild and wud 

    with whack and screech they stopp’d the same 



     gleg  bright  sharp  wud  mad 





    sae loud the tongues o’ randies grew 

      the flytin’ and the skirlin’ grew 

    at all the windows in the place 

    wi’ spoons or knives  wi’ needle or awl 

    was thrust out every hand and face 



    and down each stair they throng’d anon 

      gentle  semple  throng’d anon 

    souter and tailor  frowsy nan 

    the ancient widow young again 

    simpering behind her fan 



    without a choice  against their will 

      doited  dazed  against their will 

    the market lassie and her mither 

    the farmer and his husbandman 

    hand in hand dance a’ thegither 



    slow at first  but faster soon 

      still increasing  wild and fast 

    hoods and mantles  hats and hose 

    blindly doff’d and cast away 

    left them naked  heads and toes 



    they would have torn us limb from limb 

      dainty limb from dainty limb 

    but never one of them could win

    across the line that i had drawn

    with bleeding thumb a widdershin 



    but there was jeff the provost’s son 

      jeff the provost’s only son 



     randies  viragoes  flytin’  scolding  skirlin’  shrieking  souter 

     cobbler  doited  mazed  a widdershin  the wrong way of the sun  or

     e  to w  through n 



    there was father auld himsel’ 

    the lombard frae the hostelry 

    and the lawyer peter fell 



    all goodly men we singled out 

      waled them well  and singled out 

    and drew them by the left hand in 

    mysie the priest  and elspie won

    the lombard  nort the lawyer carle 

    i mysel’ the provost’s son 



    then  with cantrip kisses seven 

      three times round with kisses seven 

    warp’d and woven there spun we

    arms and legs and flaming hair 

    like a whirlwind on the sea 



    like a wind that sucks the sea 

      over and in and on the sea 

    good sooth it was a mad delight 

    and every man of all the four

    shut his eyes and laugh’d outright 



    laugh’d as long as they had breath 

      laugh’d while they had sense or breath 

    and close about us coil’d a mist

    of gnats and midges  wasps and flies 

    like the whirlwind shaft it rist 



    drawn up i was right off my feet 

      into the mist and off my feet 

    and  dancing on each chimney top 

    i saw a thousand darling imps

    keeping time with skip and hop 



     waled  chose  cantrip  magic 



    and on the provost’s brave ridge tile 

      on the provost’s grand ridge tile 

    the blackamoor first to master me

    i saw  i saw that winsome smile 

    the mouth that did my heart beguile 

    and spoke the great word over me 

    in the land beyond the sea 



    i call’d his name  i call’d aloud 

      alas  i call’d on him aloud 

    and then he fill’d his hand with stour 

    and threw it towards me in the air 

    my mouse flew out  i lost my pow’r 



    my lusty strength  my power were gone 

      power was gone  and all was gone 

    he will not let me love him more 

    of bell and whip and horse’s tail

    he cares not if i find a store 



    but i am proud if he is fierce 

      i am as proud as he is fierce 

    i’ll turn about and backward go 

    if i meet again that blackamoor 

    and he’ll help us then  for he shall know

    i seek another paramour 



    and we’ll gang once more to yon town 

      wi’ better luck to yon town 

    we’ll walk in silk and cramoisie 

    and i shall wed the provost’s son

    my lady of the town i’ll be 



     stour  dust  cramoisie  crimson 



    for i was born a crown’d king’s child 

      born and nursed a king’s child 

    king o’ a land ayont the sea 

    where the blackamoor kiss’d me first 

    and taught me art and glamourie 



    each one in her wame shall hide

      her hairy mouse  her wary mouse 

    fed on madwort and agramie   

    wear amber beads between her breasts 

    and blind worm’s skin about her knee 



    the lombard shall be elspie’s man 

      elspie’s gowden husband man 

    nort shall take the lawyer’s hand 

    the priest shall swear another vow 

    we’ll dance again the saraband 



     ayont  beyond  glamourie  wizardry

 732    serenade 



    softly  o midnight hours 

        move softly o’er the bowers

    where lies in happy sleep a girl so fair 

        for ye have power  men say 

        our hearts in sleep to sway 

    and cage cold fancies in a moonlight snare 

        round ivory neck and arm

        enclasp a separate charm 

    hang o’er her poised  but breathe nor sigh nor prayer

        silently ye may smile 

        but hold your breath the while 

    and let the wind sweep back your cloudy hair 

        bend down your glittering urns 

        ere yet the dawn returns 

    and star with dew the lawn her feet shall tread 

        upon the air rain balm 

        bid all the woods be calm 

    ambrosial dreams with healthful slumbers wed 

        that so the maiden may

        with smiles your care repay 

    when from her couch she lifts her golden head 

        waking with earliest birds 

        ere yet the misty herds

    leave warm ’mid the gray grass their dusky bed 





 733    sorrow 



    count each affliction  whether light or grave 

    god’s messenger sent down to thee  do thou

      with courtesy receive him  rise and bow 

    and  ere his shadow pass thy threshold  crave

    permission first his heavenly feet to lave 

      then lay before him all thou hast  allow

      no cloud of passion to usurp thy brow 

    or mar thy hospitality  no wave

    of mortal tumult to obliterate

      the soul’s marmoreal calmness  grief should be 

    like joy  majestic  equable  sedate 

      confirming  cleansing  raising  making free 

    strong to consume small troubles  to commend

    great thoughts  grave thoughts  thoughts lasting to the end

 734    the county of mayo 



from the irish of thomas lavelle



    on the deck of patrick lynch’s boat i sat in woful plight 

    through my sighing all the weary day and weeping all the night 

    were it not that full of sorrow from my people forth i go 

    by the blessèd sun  ’tis royally i’d sing thy praise  mayo 



    when i dwelt at home in plenty  and my gold did much abound 

    in the company of fair young maids the spanish ale went round  

    ’tis a bitter change from those gay days that now i’m forced to go

    and must leave my bones in santa cruz  far from my own mayo 



    they are alter’d girls in irrul now  ’tis proud they’re grown and high 

    with their hair bags and their top knots  for i pass their buckles by  

    but it’s little now i heed their airs  for god will have it so 

    that i must depart for foreign lands and leave my sweet mayo 



    ’tis my grief that patrick loughlin is not earl of irrul still 

    and that brian duff no longer rules as lord upon the hill 

    and that colonel hugh mcgrady should be lying dead and low 

    and i sailing  sailing swiftly from the county of mayo

 735    my lady’s grave 



    the linnet in the rocky dells 

      the moor lark in the air 

    the bee among the heather bells

      that hide my lady fair 



    the wild deer browse above her breast 

      the wild birds raise their brood 

    and they  her smiles of love caress’d 

      have left her solitude 



    i ween that when the grave’s dark wall

      did first her form retain 

    they thought their hearts could ne’er recall

      the light of joy again 



    they thought the tide of grief would flow

      uncheck’d through future years 

    but where is all their anguish now 

      and where are all their tears 



    well  let them fight for honour’s breath 

      or pleasure’s shade pursue  

    the dweller in the land of death

      is changed and careless too 



    and if their eyes should watch and weep

      till sorrow’s source were dry 

    she would not  in her tranquil sleep 

      return a single sigh 



    blow  west wind  by the lonely mound 

      and murmur  summer streams 

    there is no need of other sound

      to soothe my lady’s dreams 





 736    remembrance 



    cold in the earth  and the deep snow piled above thee 

      far  far removed  cold in the dreary grave 

    have i forgot  my only love  to love thee 

      sever’d at last by time’s all severing wave 



    now  when alone  do my thoughts no longer hover

      over the mountains  on that northern shore 

    resting their wings where heath and fern leaves cover

     thy noble heart for ever  ever more 



    cold in the earth  and fifteen wild decembers

      from those brown hills have melted into spring 

    faithful  indeed  is the spirit that remembers

      after such years of change and suffering 



    sweet love of youth  forgive  if i forget thee 

      while the world’s tide is bearing me along 

    other desires and other hopes beset me 

      hopes which obscure  but cannot do thee wrong 



    no later light has lighten’d up my heaven 

      no second morn has ever shone for me 

    all my life’s bliss from thy dear life was given 

      all my life’s bliss is in the grave with thee 



    but when the days of golden dreams had perish’d 

      and even despair was powerless to destroy 

    then did i learn how existence could be cherish’d 

      strengthen’d and fed without the aid of joy 



    then did i check the tears of useless passion  

      wean’d my young soul from yearning after thine 

    sternly denied its burning wish to hasten

      down to that tomb already more than mine 





    and  even yet  i dare not let it languish 

      dare not indulge in memory’s rapturous pain 

    once drinking deep of that divinest anguish 

      how could i seek the empty world again 





 737    the prisoner 



    still let my tyrants know  i am not doom’d to wear

    year after year in gloom and desolate despair 

    a messenger of hope comes every night to me 

    and offers for short life  eternal liberty 



    he comes with western winds  with evening’s wandering airs 

    with that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars 

    winds take a pensive tone  and stars a tender fire 

    and visions rise  and change  that kill me with desire 



    desire for nothing known in my maturer years 

    when joy grew mad with awe  at counting future tears 

    when  if my spirit’s sky was full of flashes warm 

    i knew not whence they came  from sun or thunder storm 



    but first  a hush of peace  a soundless calm descends 

    the struggle of distress and fierce impatience ends 

    mute music soothes my breast  unutter’d harmony

    that i could never dream  till earth was lost to me 



    then dawns the invisible  the unseen its truth reveals 

    my outward sense is gone  my inward essence feels 

    its wings are almost free  its home  its harbour found 

    measuring the gulf  it stoops  and dares the final bound 



    o dreadful is the check  intense the agony  

    when the ear begins to hear  and the eye begins to see 

    when the pulse begins to throb  the brain to think again  

    the soul to feel the flesh  and the flesh to feel the chain 





    yet i would lose no sting  would wish no torture less 

    the more that anguish racks  the earlier it will bless 

    and robed in fires of hell  or bright with heavenly shine 

    if it but herald death  the vision is divine 





 738    last lines 



      no coward soul is mine 

    no trembler in the world’s storm troubled sphere 

      i see heaven’s glories shine 

    and faith shines equal  arming me from fear 



      o god within my breast 

    almighty  ever present deity 

      life  that in me has rest 

    as i  undying life  have power in thee 



      vain are the thousand creeds

    that move men’s hearts  unutterably vain 

      worthless as wither’d weeds 

    or idlest froth amid the boundless main 



      to waken doubt in one

    holding so fast by thine infinity 

      so surely anchor’d on

    the steadfast rock of immortality 



      with wide embracing love

    thy spirit animates eternal years 

      pervades and broods above 

    changes  sustains  dissolves  creates  and rears 



      though earth and man were gone 

    and suns and universes cease to be 

      and thou were left alone 

    every existence would exist in thee 





      there is not room for death 

    nor atom that his might could render void 

      thou  thou art being and breath 

    and what thou art may never be destroyed

 739    airly beacon 



    airly beacon  airly beacon 

      o the pleasant sight to see

    shires and towns from airly beacon 

      while my love climb’d up to me 



    airly beacon  airly beacon 

      o the happy hours we lay

    deep in fern on airly beacon 

      courting through the summer’s day 



    airly beacon  airly beacon 

      o the weary haunt for me 

    all alone on airly beacon 

      with his baby on my knee 





 740    the sands of dee 



    ‘o mary  go and call the cattle home 

        and call the cattle home 

        and call the cattle home 

        across the sands of dee ’

    the western wind was wild and dark with foam 

        and all alone went she 





    the western tide crept up along the sand 

        and o’er and o’er the sand 

        and round and round the sand 

        as far as eye could see 

    the rolling mist came down and hid the land 

        and never home came she 



    ‘o is it weed  or fish  or floating hair  

        a tress of golden hair 

        a drownèd maiden’s hair 

        above the nets at sea ’

    was never salmon yet that shone so fair

        among the stakes of dee 



    they row’d her in across the rolling foam 

        the cruel crawling foam 

        the cruel hungry foam 

        to her grave beside the sea 

    but still the boatmen hear her call the cattle home 

        across the sands of dee

 741    say not the struggle naught availeth 



    say not the struggle naught availeth 

      the labour and the wounds are vain 

    the enemy faints not  nor faileth 

      and as things have been they remain 



    if hopes were dupes  fears may be liars 

      it may be  in yon smoke conceal’d 

    your comrades chase e’en now the fliers 

      and  but for you  possess the field 





    for while the tired waves  vainly breaking 

      seem here no painful inch to gain 

    far back  through creeks and inlets making 

      comes silent  flooding in  the main 



    and not by eastern windows only 

      when daylight comes  comes in the light 

    in front the sun climbs slow  how slowly 

      but westward  look  the land is bright

 742    the imprisoned soul 



    at the last  tenderly 

    from the walls of the powerful  fortress’d house 

    from the clasp of the knitted locks  from the keep of the well closed doors 

    let me be wafted 



    let me glide noiselessly forth 

    with the key of softness unlock the locks  with a whisper

    set ope the doors  o soul 



    tenderly  be not impatient 

     strong is your hold  o mortal flesh 

    strong is your hold  o love  





 743    o captain  my captain  



    o captain  my captain  our fearful trip is done 

    the ship has weather’d every rack  the prize we sought is won 

    the port is near  the bells i hear  the people all exulting 

    while follow eyes the steady keel  the vessel grim and daring 

            but o heart  heart  heart 

              o the bleeding drops of red 

                where on the deck my captain lies 

                  fallen cold and dead 



    o captain  my captain  rise up and hear the bells 

    rise up  for you the flag is flung  for you the bugle trills 

    for you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths  for you the shores crowding 

    for you they call  the swaying mass  their eager faces turning 

            here  captain  dear father 

              this arm beneath your head 

                it is some dream that on the deck

                  you’ve fallen cold and dead 



    my captain does not answer  his lips are pale and still 

    my father does not feel my arm  he has no pulse nor will 

    the ship is anchor’d safe and sound  its voyage closed and done 

    from fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won 

            exult  o shores  and ring  o bells 

              but i  with mournful tread 

                walk the deck my captain lies 

                  fallen cold and dead

    lay thou thy soul full in her hands  low at her feet 

    fail  sun and breath   yet  for thy peace  she shall endure

 745    when the world is burning 



    when the world is burning 

    fired within  yet turning

      round with face unscathed 

    ere fierce flames  uprushing 

    o’er all lands leap  crushing 

      till earth fall  fire swathed 

    up amidst the meadows 

    gently through the shadows 

      gentle flames will glide 

    small  and blue  and golden 

    though by bard beholden 

    when in calm dreams folden   

      calm his dreams will bide 



    where the dance is sweeping 

    through the greensward peeping 

      shall the soft lights start 

    laughing maids  unstaying 

    deeming it trick playing 

    high their robes upswaying 

      o’er the lights shall dart 

    and the woodland haunter

    shall not cease to saunter

      when  far down some glade 

    of the great world’s burning 

    one soft flame upturning

    seems  to his discerning 

      crocus in the shade

    beating heart  we come again

      where my love reposes 

    this is mabel’s window pane 

      these are mabel’s roses 



    is she nested  does she kneel

      in the twilight stilly 

    lily clad from throat to heel 

      she  my virgin lily 



    soon the wan  the wistful stars 

      fading  will forsake her 

    elves of light  on beamy bars 

      whisper then  and wake her 



    let this friendly pebble plead

      at her flowery grating 

    if she hear me will she heed 

       mabel  i am waiting  



    mabel will be deck’d anon 

      zoned in bride’s apparel 

    happy zone  o hark to yon

      passion shaken carol 



    sing thy song  thou trancèd thrush

 747    the forsaken merman 



      come  dear children  let us away 

      down and away below 

      now my brothers call from the bay 

      now the great winds shoreward blow 

      now the salt tides seaward flow 

      now the wild white horses play 

      champ and chafe and toss in the spray 

        children dear  let us away 

          this way  this way 



      call her once before you go 

            call once yet 

      in a voice that she will know 

        ‘margaret  margaret ’

      children’s voices should be dear

       call once more  to a mother’s ear 

      children’s voices  wild with pain 

      surely she will come again 

      call her once and come away 

            this way  this way 

      ‘mother dear  we cannot stay ’

      the wild white horses foam and fret 

        margaret  margaret 



      come  dear children  come away down 

          call no more 

      one last look at the white wall’d town 

    and the little grey church on the windy shore 

          then come down 

      she will not come though you call all day 

        come away  come away 

      children dear  was it yesterday

      we heard the sweet bells over the bay 

      in the caverns where we lay 

      through the surf and through the swell 

      the far off sound of a silver bell 

      sand strewn caverns  cool and deep 

      where the winds are all asleep 

      where the spent lights quiver and gleam 

      where the salt weed sways in the stream 

      where the sea beasts  ranged all round 

      feed in the ooze of their pasture ground 

      where the sea snakes coil and twine 

      dry their mail  and bask in the brine 

      where great whales come sailing by 

      sail and sail  with unshut eye 

      round the world for ever and aye 

      when did music come this way 

      children dear  was it yesterday 



      children dear  was it yesterday

       call yet once  that she went away 

      once she sate with you and me 

    on a red gold throne in the heart of the sea 

      and the youngest sate on her knee 

    she comb’d its bright hair  and she tended it well 

    when down swung the sound of the far off bell 

    she sigh’d  she look’d up through the clear green sea 

    she said  ‘i must go  for my kinsfolk pray

    in the little grey church on the shore to day 

    ’twill be easter time in the world  ah me 

    and i lose my poor soul  merman  here with thee ’

    i said  ‘go up  dear heart  through the waves 

    say thy prayer  and come back to the kind sea caves ’

    she smiled  she went up through the surf in the bay 

      children dear  was it yesterday 



      children dear  were we long alone 

    ‘the sea grows stormy  the little ones moan 

    long prayers ’ i said  ‘in the world they say 

    come ’ i said  and we rose through the surf in the bay 

    we went up the beach  by the sandy down

    where the sea stocks bloom  to the white wall’d town 

    through the narrow paved streets  where all was still 

    to the little grey church on the windy hill 

    from the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers 

    but we stood without in the cold blowing airs 

    we climb’d on the graves  on the stones worn with rains 

    and we gazed up the aisle through the small leaded panes 

      she sate by the pillar  we saw her clear 

      ‘margaret  hist  come quick  we are here 

      dear heart ’ i said  ‘we are long alone 

      the sea grows stormy  the little ones moan ’

    but  ah  she gave me never a look 

    for her eyes were seal’d to the holy book 

    loud prays the priest  shut stands the door 

      come away  children  call no more 

      come away  come down  call no more 



        down  down  down 

      down to the depths of the sea 

    she sits at her wheel in the humming town 

      singing most joyfully 

    hark what she sings  ‘o joy  o joy 

    for the humming street  and the child with its toy 

    for the priest  and the bell  and the holy well 

      for the wheel where i spun 

      and the blessed light of the sun ’

      and so she sings her fill 

      singing most joyfully 

      till the shuttle falls from her hand 

      and the whizzing wheel stands still 

    she steals to the window  and looks at the sand 

      and over the sand at the sea 

      and her eyes are set in a stare 

      and anon there breaks a sigh 

      and anon there drops a tear 

      from a sorrow clouded eye 

      and a heart sorrow laden 

        a long  long sigh

    for the cold strange eyes of a little mermaiden 

      and the gleam of her golden hair 



      come away  away  children 

      come children  come down 

      the hoarse wind blows colder 

      lights shine in the town 

      she will start from her slumber

      when gusts shake the door 

      she will hear the winds howling 

      will hear the waves roar 

      we shall see  while above us

      the waves roar and whirl 

      a ceiling of amber 

      a pavement of pearl 

      singing  ‘here came a mortal 

      but faithless was she 

      and alone dwell for ever

      the kings of the sea ’



      but  children  at midnight 

      when soft the winds blow 

      when clear falls the moonlight 

      when spring tides are low 

      when sweet airs come seaward

      from heaths starr’d with broom 

      and high rocks throw mildly

      on the blanch’d sands a gloom 

      up the still  glistening beaches 

      up the creeks we will hie 

      over banks of bright seaweed

      the ebb tide leaves dry 

      we will gaze  from the sand hills 

      at the white  sleeping town 

      at the church on the hill side  

        and then come back down 

      singing  ‘there dwells a loved one 

        but cruel is she 

      she left lonely for ever

        the kings of the sea ’





 748    the song of callicles 



    through the black  rushing smoke bursts 

    thick breaks the red flame 

    all etna heaves fiercely

    her forest clothed frame 



    not here  o apollo 

    are haunts meet for thee 

    but  where helicon breaks down

    in cliff to the sea 



    where the moon silver’d inlets

    send far their light voice

    up the still vale of thisbe 

    o speed  and rejoice 



    on the sward at the cliff top 

    lie strewn the white flocks 

    on the cliff side  the pigeons

    roost deep in the rocks 



    in the moonlight the shepherds 

    soft lull’d by the rills 

    lie wrapt in their blankets 

    asleep on the hills 



      what forms are these coming

    so white through the gloom 

    what garments out glistening

    the gold flower’d broom 



    what sweet breathing presence

    out perfumes the thyme 

    what voices enrapture

    the night’s balmy prime   



    ’tis apollo comes leading

    his choir  the nine 

      the leader is fairest 

    but all are divine 



    they are lost in the hollows 

    they stream up again 

    what seeks on this mountain

    the glorified train   



    they bathe on this mountain 

    in the spring by their road 

    then on to olympus 

    their endless abode 



      whose praise do they mention

    of what is it told   

    what will be for ever 

    what was from of old 



    first hymn they the father

    of all things  and then 

    the rest of immortals 

    the action of men 



    the day in his hotness 

    the strife with the palm 

    the night in her silence 

    the stars in their calm 





 749    to marguerite 



    yes  in the sea of life enisled 

      with echoing straits between us thrown 

    dotting the shoreless watery wild 

      we mortal millions live  alone  

    the islands feel the enclasping flow 

    and then their endless bounds they know 



    but when the moon their hollows lights 

      and they are swept by balms of spring 

    and in their glens  on starry nights 

      the nightingales divinely sing 

    and lovely notes  from shore to shore 

    across the sounds and channels pour 



    o then a longing like despair

      is to their farthest caverns sent 

    for surely once  they feel  we were

      parts of a single continent 

    now round us spreads the watery plain  

    o might our marges meet again 



    who order’d that their longing’s fire

      should be  as soon as kindled  cool’d 

    who renders vain their deep desire   

      a god  a god their severance ruled 

    and bade betwixt their shores to be

    the unplumb’d  salt  estranging sea 





 750    requiescat 



    strew on her roses  roses 

      and never a spray of yew 

    in quiet she reposes 

      ah  would that i did too 



    her mirth the world required 

      she bathed it in smiles of glee 

    but her heart was tired  tired 

      and now they let her be 



    her life was turning  turning 

      in mazes of heat and sound 

    but for peace her soul was yearning 

      and now peace laps her round 



    her cabin’d  ample spirit 

      it flutter’d and fail’d for breath 

    to night it doth inherit

      the vasty hall of death 





 751    the scholar gipsy 



    go  for they call you  shepherd  from the hill 

      go  shepherd  and untie the wattled cotes 

        no longer leave thy wistful flock unfed 

      nor let thy bawling fellows rack their throats 

        nor the cropp’d grasses shoot another head 

          but when the fields are still 

      and the tired men and dogs all gone to rest 

        and only the white sheep are sometimes seen

        cross and recross the strips of moon blanch’d green 

      come  shepherd  and again begin the quest 



    here  where the reaper was at work of late 

      in this high field’s dark corner  where he leaves

        his coat  his basket  and his earthen cruise 

      and in the sun all morning binds the sheaves 

        then here  at noon  comes back his stores to use 

          here will i sit and wait 

      while to my ear from uplands far away

        the bleating of the folded flocks is borne 

        with distant cries of reapers in the corn  

      all the live murmur of a summer’s day 



    screen’d is this nook o’er the high  half reap’d field 

      and here till sundown  shepherd  will i be 

        through the thick corn the scarlet poppies peep 

      and round green roots and yellowing stalks i see

        pale blue convolvulus in tendrils creep 

          and air swept lindens yield

      their scent  and rustle down their perfumed showers

        of bloom on the bent grass where i am laid 

        and bower me from the august sun with shade 

      and the eye travels down to oxford’s towers 





    and near me on the grass lies glanvil’s book  

      come  let me read the oft read tale again 

        the story of that oxford scholar poor 

      of pregnant parts and quick inventive brain 

        who  tired of knocking at preferment’s door 

          one summer morn forsook

      his friends  and went to learn the gipsy lore 

        and roam’d the world with that wild brotherhood 

        and came  as most men deem’d  to little good 

      but came to oxford and his friends no more 



    but once  years after  in the country lanes 

      two scholars  whom at college erst he knew 

        met him  and of his way of life inquired 

      whereat he answer’d that the gipsy crew 

        his mates  had arts to rule as they desired

          the workings of men’s brains 

      and they can bind them to what thoughts they will 

        ‘and i ’ he said  ‘the secret of their art 

        when fully learn’d  will to the world impart 

      but it needs heaven sent moments for this skill ’



    this said  he left them  and return’d no more 

      but rumours hung about the country side 

        that the lost scholar long was seen to stray 

      seen by rare glimpses  pensive and tongue tied 

        in hat of antique shape  and cloak of grey 

          the same the gipsies wore 

      shepherds had met him on the hurst in spring 

        at some lone alehouse in the berkshire moors 

        on the warm ingle bench  the smock frock’d boors

      had found him seated at their entering 

    but  ’mid their drink and clatter  he would fly 

      and i myself seem half to know thy looks 

        and put the shepherds  wanderer  on thy trace 

      and boys who in lone wheatfields scare the rooks

        i ask if thou hast pass’d their quiet place 

          or in my boat i lie

      moor’d to the cool bank in the summer heats 

        ‘mid wide grass meadows which the sunshine fills 

        and watch the warm green muffled cumnor hills 

      and wonder if thou haunt’st their shy retreats 



    for most  i know  thou lov’st retirèd ground 

      thee  at the ferry  oxford riders blithe 

        returning home on summer nights  have met

      crossing the stripling thames at bablock hithe 

        trailing in the cool stream thy fingers wet 

          as the slow punt swings round 

      and leaning backwards in a pensive dream 

        and fostering in thy lap a heap of flowers

        pluck’d in shy fields and distant wychwood bowers 

      and thine eyes resting on the moonlit stream 



    and then they land  and thou art seen no more 

      maidens who from the distant hamlets come

        to dance around the fyfield elm in may 

      oft through the darkening fields have seen thee roam 

        or cross a stile into the public way 

          oft thou hast given them store

      of flowers  the frail leaf’d  white anemone  

        dark bluebells drench’d with dews of summer eves 

        and purple orchises with spotted leaves  

      but none has words she can report of thee 



    and  above godstow bridge  when hay time’s here

      in june  and many a scythe in sunshine flames 

        men who through those wide fields of breezy grass

      where black wing’d swallows haunt the glittering thames 

        to bathe in the abandon’d lasher pass 

          have often pass’d thee near

      sitting upon the river bank o’ergrown 

        mark’d thine outlandish garb  thy figure spare 

        thy dark vague eyes  and soft abstracted air 

      but  when they came from bathing  thou wert gone 



    at some lone homestead in the cumnor hills 

      where at her open door the housewife darns 

        thou hast been seen  or hanging on a gate

      to watch the threshers in the mossy barns 

        children  who early range these slopes and late

          for cresses from the rills 

      have known thee watching  all an april day 

        the springing pastures and the feeding kine 

        and mark’d thee  when the stars come out and shine 

      through the long dewy grass move slow away 



    in autumn  on the skirts of bagley wood 

      where most the gipsies by the turf edged way

        pitch their smoked tents  and every bush you see

      with scarlet patches tagg’d and shreds of gray 

        above the forest ground call’d thessaly  

          the blackbird picking food

      sees thee  nor stops his meal  nor fears at all 

        so often has he known thee past him stray

        rapt  twirling in thy hand a wither’d spray 

      and waiting for the spark from heaven to fall 



    and once  in winter  on the causeway chill

      where home through flooded fields foot travellers go 

        have i not pass’d thee on the wooden bridge

      wrapt in thy cloak and battling with the snow 

        thy face towards hinksey and its wintry ridge 

          and thou hast climb’d the hill

      and gain’d the white brow of the cumnor range 

        turn’d once to watch  while thick the snowflakes fall 

        the line of festal light in christ church hall  

      then sought thy straw in some sequester’d grange 



    but what  i dream  two hundred years are flown

      since first thy story ran through oxford halls 

        and the grave glanvil did the tale inscribe

      that thou wert wander’d from the studious walls

        to learn strange arts  and join a gipsy tribe 

          and thou from earth art gone

      long since  and in some quiet churchyard laid 

        some country nook  where o’er thy unknown grave

        tall grasses and white flowering nettles wave  

      under a dark red fruited yew tree’s shade 



      no  no  thou hast not felt the lapse of hours 

      for what wears out the life of mortal men 

        ’tis that from change to change their being rolls 

      ’tis that repeated shocks  again  again 

        exhaust the energy of strongest souls 

          and numb the elastic powers 

      till having used our nerves with bliss and teen 

        and tired upon a thousand schemes our wit 

        to the just pausing genius we remit

      our worn out life  and are  what we have been 



    thou hast not lived  why shouldst thou perish  so 

      thou hadst  one  aim   one  business   one  desire 

        else wert thou long since number’d with the dead  

      else hadst thou spent  like other men  thy fire 

        the generations of thy peers are fled 

          and we ourselves shall go 

      but thou possessest an immortal lot 

        and we imagine thee exempt from age

        and living as thou liv’st on glanvil’s page 

      because thou hadst  what we  alas  have not 



    for early didst thou leave the world  with powers

      fresh  undiverted to the world without 

        firm to their mark  not spent on other things 

      free from the sick fatigue  the languid doubt 

        which much to have tried  in much been baffled  brings 

          o life unlike to ours 

      who fluctuate idly without term or scope 

        of whom each strives  nor knows for what he strives 

        and each half lives a hundred different lives 

      who wait like thee  but not  like thee  in hope 



    thou waitest for the spark from heaven  and we 

      vague half believers of our casual creeds 

        who never deeply felt  nor clearly will’d 

      whose insight never has borne fruit in deeds 

        whose weak resolves never have been fulfill’d 

          for whom each year we see

      breeds new beginnings  disappointments new 

        who hesitate and falter life away 

        and lose to morrow the ground won to day  

      ah  do not we  wanderer  await it too 



    yes  we await it  but it still delays 

      and then we suffer  and amongst us one 

        who most has suffer’d  takes dejectedly

      his seat upon the intellectual throne 

        and all his store of sad experience he

          lays bare of wretched days 

      tells us his misery’s birth and growth and signs 

        and how the dying spark of hope was fed 

        and how the breast was soothed  and how the head 

      and all his hourly varied anodynes 



    this for our wisest  and we others pine 

      and wish the long unhappy dream would end 

        and waive all claim to bliss  and try to bear 

      with close lipp’d patience for our only friend 

        sad patience  too near neighbour to despair 

          but none has hope like thine 

      thou through the fields and through the woods dost stray 

        roaming the country side  a truant boy 

        nursing thy project in unclouded joy 

      and every doubt long blown by time away 



    o born in days when wits were fresh and clear 

      and life ran gaily as the sparkling thames 

        before this strange disease of modern life 

      with its sick hurry  its divided aims 

        its heads o’ertax’d  its palsied hearts  was rife  

          fly hence  our contact fear 

      still fly  plunge deeper in the bowering wood 

        averse  as dido did with gesture stern

        from her false friend’s approach in hades turn 

      wave us away  and keep thy solitude 



    still nursing the unconquerable hope 

      still clutching the inviolable shade 

        with a free onward impulse brushing through 

      by night  the silver’d branches of the glade  

        far on the forest skirts  where none pursue 

          on some mild pastoral slope

      emerge  and resting on the moonlit pales 

        freshen thy flowers  as in former years 

        with dew  or listen with enchanted ears 

      from the dark dingles  to the nightingales 



    but fly our paths  our feverish contact fly 

      for strong the infection of our mental strife 

        which  though it gives no bliss  yet spoils for rest 

      and we should win thee from thy own fair life 

        like us distracted  and like us unblest 

          soon  soon thy cheer would die 

      thy hopes grow timorous  and unfix’d thy powers 

        and thy clear aims be cross and shifting made 

        and then thy glad perennial youth would fade 

      fade  and grow old at last  and die like ours 



    then fly our greetings  fly our speech and smiles 

      as some grave tyrian trader  from the sea 

        descried at sunrise an emerging prow

      lifting the cool hair’d creepers stealthily 

        the fringes of a southward facing brow

          among the ægean isles 

      and saw the merry grecian coaster come 

        freighted with amber grapes  and chian wine 

        green bursting figs  and tunnies steep’d in brine 

      and knew the intruders on his ancient home 

    the young light hearted masters of the waves 

      and snatch’d his rudder  and shook out more sail 

        and day and night held on indignantly

      o’er the blue midland waters with the gale 

        betwixt the syrtes and soft sicily 

          to where the atlantic raves

      outside the western straits  and unbent sails

        there  where down cloudy cliffs  through sheets of foam 

        shy traffickers  the dark iberians come 

      and on the beach undid his corded bales 





 752    philomela 



    hark  ah  the nightingale 

    the tawny throated 

    hark  from that moonlit cedar what a burst 

    what triumph  hark  what pain 



    o wanderer from a grecian shore 

    still  after many years  in distant lands 

    still nourishing in thy bewilder’d brain

    that wild  unquench’d  deep sunken  old world pain  

      say  will it never heal 

    and can this fragrant lawn

    with its cool trees  and night 

    and the sweet  tranquil thames 

    and moonshine  and the dew 

    to thy rack’d heart and brain

      afford no balm 



      dost thou to night behold

    here  through the moonlight on this english grass 

    the unfriendly palace in the thracian wild 

      dost thou again peruse

    with hot cheeks and sear’d eyes

    the too clear web  and thy dumb sister’s shame 

      dost thou once more assay

    thy flight  and feel come over thee 

    poor fugitive  the feathery change

    once more  and once more seem to make resound

    with love and hate  triumph and agony 

    lone daulis  and the high cephissian vale 

        listen  eugenia  

    how thick the bursts come crowding through the leaves

      again  thou hearest 

    eternal passion 

    eternal pain 





 753    shakespeare 



    others abide our question  thou art free 

    we ask and ask  thou smilest and art still 

    out topping knowledge  for the loftiest hill

    that to the stars uncrowns his majesty 

    planting his steadfast footsteps in the sea 

    making the heaven of heavens his dwelling place 

    spares but the cloudy border of his base

    to the foil’d searching of mortality 

    and thou  who didst the stars and sunbeams know 

    self school’d  self scann’d  self honour’d  self secure 

    didst walk on earth unguess’d at  better so 

    all pains the immortal spirit must endure 

      all weakness that impairs  all griefs that bow 

      find their sole voice in that victorious brow 





 754    from the hymn of empedocles 



          is it so small a thing

          to have enjoy’d the sun 

          to have lived light in the spring 

          to have loved  to have thought  to have done 

    to have advanced true friends  and beat down baffling foes 



          that we must feign a bliss

          of doubtful future date 

          and while we dream on this

          lose all our present state 

    and relegate to worlds yet distant our repose 



          not much  i know  you prize

          what pleasures may be had 

          who look on life with eyes

          estranged  like mine  and sad 

    and yet the village churl feels the truth more than you 



          who’s loth to leave this life

          which to him little yields 

          his hard task’d sunburnt wife 

          his often labour’d fields 

    the boors with whom he talk’d  the country spots he knew 



          but thou  because thou hear’st

          men scoff at heaven and fate 

          because the gods thou fear’st

          fail to make blest thy state 

    tremblest  and wilt not dare to trust the joys there are 



          i say  fear not  life still

          leaves human effort scope 

          but  since life teems with ill 

          nurse no extravagant hope 

    because thou must not dream  thou need’st not then despair

 755    the flowers 



    when love arose in heart and deed

      to wake the world to greater joy 

    ‘what can she give me now ’ said greed 

      who thought to win some costly toy 



    he rose  he ran  he stoop’d  he clutch’d 

      and soon the flowers  that love let fall 

    in greed’s hot grasp were fray’d and smutch’d 

      and greed said  ‘flowers  can this be all ’



    he flung them down and went his way 

      he cared no jot for thyme or rose 

    but boys and girls came out to play 

      and some took these and some took those  



    red  blue  and white  and green and gold 

      and at their touch the dew return’d 

    and all the bloom a thousandfold  

      so red  so ripe  the roses burn’d 





 756    the thought 



    into the skies  one summer’s day 

    i sent a little thought away 

    up to where  in the blue round 

    the sun sat shining without sound 



    then my thought came back to me   

    little thought  what did you see

    in the regions whence you come 

    and when i spoke  my thought was dumb 



    but she breathed of what was there 

    in the pure bright upper air 

    and  because my thought so shone 

    i knew she had been shone upon 



    next  by night a thought i sent

    up into the firmament 

    when the eager stars were out 

    and the still moon shone about 



    and my thought went past the moon

    in between the stars  but soon

    held her breath and durst not stir 

    for the fear that covered her 

    then she thought  in this demur 



    ‘dare i look beneath the shade 

    into where the worlds are made 

    where the suns and stars are wrought 

    shall i meet another thought 



    ‘will that other thought have wings 

    shall i meet strange  heavenly things 

    thought of thoughts  and light of lights 

    breath of breaths  and night of nights ’



    then my thought began to hark

    in the illuminated dark 

    till the silence  over  under 

    made her heart beat more than thunder 



    and my thought  came trembling back 

    but with something on her track 

    and with something at her side 

    nor till she has lived and died 

    lived and died  and lived again 

    will that awful thing seem plain

i



    of all the flowers rising now 

      thou only saw’st the head

    of that unopen’d drop of snow

      i placed beside thy bed 



    in all the blooms that blow so fast 

      thou hast no further part 

    save those the hour i saw thee last 

      i laid above thy heart 



    two snowdrops for our boy and girl 

      a primrose blown for me 

    wreathed with one often play’d with curl

      from each bright head for thee 



    and so i graced thee for thy grave 

      and made these tokens fast

    with that old silver heart i gave 

      my first gift  and my last 





ii



    i dream’d  her babe upon her breast 

    here she might lie and calmly rest

    her happy eyes on that far hill

    that backs the landscape fresh and still 



    i hoped her thoughts would thrid the boughs

    where careless birds on love carouse 

    and gaze those apple blossoms through

    to revel in the boundless blue 



    but now her faculty of sight

    is elder sister to the light 

    and travels free and unconfined

    through dense and rare  through form and mind 



    or else her life to be complete

    hath found new channels full and meet  

    then  o  what eyes are leaning o’er 

    if fairer than they were before

    you promise heavens free from strife 

      pure truth  and perfect change of will 

    but sweet  sweet is this human life 

      so sweet  i fain would breathe it still 

    your chilly stars i can forgo 

    this warm kind world is all i know 



    you say there is no substance here 

      one great reality above 

    back from that void i shrink in fear 

      and child like hide myself in love 

    show me what angels feel  till then

    i cling  a mere weak man  to men 



    you bid me lift my mean desires

      from faltering lips and fitful veins

    to sexless souls  ideal quires 

      unwearied voices  wordless strains 

    my mind with fonder welcome owns

    one dear dead friend’s remember’d tones 



    forsooth the present we must give

      to that which cannot pass away 

    all beauteous things for which we live

      by laws of time and space decay 

    but o  the very reason why

    i clasp them  is because they die 





 759    heraclitus 



    they told me  heraclitus  they told me you were dead 

    they brought me bitter news to hear and bitter tears to shed 

    i wept as i remember’d how often you and i

    had tired the sun with talking and sent him down the sky 



    and now that thou art lying  my dear old carian guest 

    a handful of grey ashes  long  long ago at rest 

    still are thy pleasant voices  thy nightingales  awake 

    for death  he taketh all away  but them he cannot take

 760    the married lover 



    why  having won her  do i woo 

      because her spirit’s vestal grace

    provokes me always to pursue 

      but  spirit like  eludes embrace 

    because her womanhood is such

      that  as on court days subjects kiss

    the queen’s hand  yet so near a touch

      affirms no mean familiarness 

    nay  rather marks more fair the height

      which can with safety so neglect

    to dread  as lower ladies might 

      that grace could meet with disrespect 

    thus she with happy favour feeds

      allegiance from a love so high

    that thence no false conceit proceeds

      of difference bridged  or state put by 

    because although in act and word

      as lowly as a wife can be 

    her manners  when they call me lord 

      remind me ’tis by courtesy 

    not with her least consent of will 

      which would my proud affection hurt 

    but by the noble style that still

      imputes an unattain’d desert 

    because her gay and lofty brows 

      when all is won which hope can ask 

    reflect a light of hopeless snows

      that bright in virgin ether bask 

    because  though free of the outer court

      i am  this temple keeps its shrine

    sacred to heaven  because  in short 

      she’s not and never can be mine 





 761   ‘ if i were dead ’



    ‘if i were dead  you’d sometimes say  poor child ’

    the dear lips quiver’d as they spake 

    and the tears brake

    from eyes which  not to grieve me  brightly smiled 

    poor child  poor child 

    i seem to hear your laugh  your talk  your song 

    it is not true that love will do no wrong 

    poor child 

    and did you think  when you so cried and smiled 

    how i  in lonely nights  should lie awake 

    and of those words your full avengers make 

    poor child  poor child 

    and now  unless it be

    that sweet amends thrice told are come to thee 

    o god  have thou  no  mercy upon me 

    poor child 





 762    departure 



    it was not like your great and gracious ways 

    do you  that have naught other to lament 

    never  my love  repent

    of how  that july afternoon 

    you went 

    with sudden  unintelligible phrase 

    and frighten’d eye 

    upon your journey of so many days

    without a single kiss  or a good bye 

    i knew  indeed  that you were parting soon 

    and so we sate  within the low sun’s rays 

    you whispering to me  for your voice was weak 

    your harrowing praise 

    well  it was well

    to hear you such things speak 

    and i could tell

    what made your eyes a growing gloom of love 

    as a warm south wind sombres a march grove 

    and it was like your great and gracious ways

    to turn your talk on daily things  my dear 

    lifting the luminous  pathetic lash

    to let the laughter flash 

    whilst i drew near 

    because you spoke so low that i could scarcely hear 

    but all at once to leave me at the last 

    more at the wonder than the loss aghast 

    with huddled  unintelligible phrase 

    and frighten’d eye 

    and go your journey of all days

    with not one kiss  or a good bye 

    and the only loveless look the look with which you pass’d 

    ’twas all unlike your great and gracious ways 





 763    the toys 



    my little son  who look’d from thoughtful eyes

    and moved and spoke in quiet grown up wise 

    having my law the seventh time disobey’d 

    i struck him  and dismissed

    with hard words and unkiss’d 

      his mother  who was patient  being dead 

    then  fearing lest his grief should hinder sleep 

    i visited his bed 

    but found him slumbering deep 

    with darkened eyelids  and their lashes yet

    from his late sobbing wet 

    and i  with moan 

    kissing away his tears  left others of my own 

    for  on a table drawn beside his head 

    he had put  within his reach 

    a box of counters and a red vein’d stone 

    a piece of glass abraded by the beach 

    and six or seven shells 

    a bottle with bluebells 

    and two french copper coins  ranged there with careful art 

    to comfort his sad heart 

    so when that night i pray’d

    to god  i wept  and said 

    ah  when at last we lie with trancèd breath 

    not vexing thee in death 

    and thou rememberest of what toys

    we made our joys 

    how weakly understood

    thy great commanded good 

    then  fatherly not less

    than i whom thou hast moulded from the clay 

    thou’lt leave thy wrath  and say 

    ‘i will be sorry for their childishness ’





 764    a farewell 



    with all my will  but much against my heart 

    we two now part 

    my very dear 

    our solace is  the sad road lies so clear 

    it needs no art 

    with faint  averted feet

    and many a tear 

    in our opposèd paths to persevere 

    go thou to east  i west 

    we will not say

    there’s any hope  it is so far away 

    but  o  my best 

    when the one darling of our widowhead 

    the nursling grief 

    is dead 

    and no dews blur our eyes

    to see the peach bloom come in evening skies 

    perchance we may 

    where now this night is day 

    and even through faith of still averted feet 

    making full circle of our banishment 

    amazèd meet 

    the bitter journey to the bourne so sweet

    seasoning the termless feast of our content

    with tears of recognition never dry

      and thro’ the silver meads 



    ravelston  ravelston 

      the stile beneath the tree 

    the maid that kept her mother’s kine 

      the song that sang she 



    she sang her song  she kept her kine 

      she sat beneath the thorn 

    when andrew keith of ravelston

      rode thro’ the monday morn 



    his henchmen sing  his hawk bells ring 

      his belted jewels shine 

    o keith of ravelston 

      the sorrows of thy line 



    year after year  where andrew came 

      comes evening down the glade 

    and still there sits a moonshine ghost

      where sat the sunshine maid 



    her misty hair is faint and fair 

      she keeps the shadowy kine 

    o keith of ravelston 

      the sorrows of thy line 



    i lay my hand upon the stile 

      the stile is lone and cold 

    the burnie that goes babbling by

      says naught that can be told 



    yet  stranger  here  from year to year 

      she keeps her shadowy kine 

    o keith of ravelston 

      the sorrows of thy line 



    step out three steps  where andrew stood  

      why blanch thy cheeks for fear 

    the ancient stile is not alone 

      ’tis not the burn i hear 



    she makes her immemorial moan 

      she keeps her shadowy kine 

    o keith of ravelston 

      the sorrows of thy line 





 766    return  



    return  return  all night my lamp is burning 

    all night  like it  my wide eyes watch and burn 

    like it  i fade and pale  when day returning

    bears witness that the absent can return 

                return  return 



    like it  i lessen with a lengthening sadness 

    like it  i burn to waste and waste to burn 

    like it  i spend the golden oil of gladness

    to feed the sorrowy signal for return 

                return  return 



    like it  like it  whene’er the east wind sings 

    i bend and shake  like it  i quake and yearn 

    when hope’s late butterflies  with whispering wings 

    fly in out of the dark  to fall and burn  

      burn in the watchfire of return 

                return  return 



    like it  the very flame whereby i pine

    consumes me to its nature  while i mourn

    my soul becomes a better soul than mine 

    and from its brightening beacon i discern

    my starry love go forth from me  and shine

    across the seas a path for thy return 

                return  return 



    return  return  all night i see it burn 

    all night it prays like me  and lifts a twin

    of palmèd praying hands that meet and yearn  

    yearn to the impleaded skies for thy return 

    day  like a golden fetter  locks them in 

    and wans the light that withers  tho’ it burn

      as warmly still for thy return 

    still thro’ the splendid load uplifts the thin

    pale  paler  palest patience that can learn

    naught but that votive sign for thy return  

    that single suppliant sign for thy return 

                return  return 



    return  return  lest haply  love  or e’er

    thou touch the lamp the light have ceased to burn 

    and thou  who thro’ the window didst discern

    the wonted flame  shalt reach the topmost stair

      to find no wide eyes watching there 

    no wither’d welcome waiting thy return 

    a passing ghost  a smoke wreath in the air 

    the flameless ashes  and the soulless urn 

    warm with the famish’d fire that lived to burn  

    burn out its lingering life for thy return 

    its last of lingering life for thy return 

    its last of lingering life to light thy late return 

                return  return 





 767    a chanted calendar 



    first came the primrose 

    on the bank high 

    like a maiden looking forth

    from the window of a tower

    when the battle rolls below 

    so look’d she 

    and saw the storms go by 

                then came the wind flower

                in the valley left behind 

                as a wounded maiden  pale

                with purple streaks of woe 

                when the battle has roll’d by

                wanders to and fro 

                so totter’d she 

                dishevelled in the wind 



                then came the daisies 

                on the first of may 

                like a banner’d show’s advance

                while the crowd runs by the way 

    with ten thousand flowers about them they came trooping through the fields 

                as a happy people come 

                so came they 

                as a happy people come

                when the war has roll’d away 

                with dance and tabor  pipe and drum 

                and all make holiday 



                then came the cowslip 

                like a dancer in the fair 

                she spread her little mat of green 

                and on it danced she 

                with a fillet bound about her brow 

                a fillet round her happy brow 

                a golden fillet round her brow 

                and rubies in her hair 





 768    laus deo 



    in the hall the coffin waits  and the idle armourer stands 

    at his belt the coffin nails  and the hammer in his hands 

    the bed of state is hung with crape  the grand old bed where she was wed  

    and like an upright corpse she sitteth gazing dumbly at the bed 

    hour by hour her serving men enter by the curtain’d door 

    and with steps of muffled woe pass breathless o’er the silent floor 

    and marshal mutely round  and look from each to each with eyelids red 

    ‘touch him not ’ she shriek’d and cried  ‘he is but newly dead ’

    ‘o my own dear mistress ’ the ancient nurse did say 

    ‘seven long days and seven long nights you have watch’d him where he lay ’

    ‘seven long days and seven long nights ‘the hoary steward said 

    ‘seven long days and seven long nights ’ groan’d the warrener gray 

    ‘seven ’ said the old henchman  and bow’d his aged head 

    ‘on your lives ’ she shriek’d and cried ‘he is but newly dead ’

            then a father priest they sought 

            the priest that taught her all she knew 

            and they told him of her loss 

            ‘for she is mild and sweet of will 

            she loved him  and his words are peace 

            and he shall heal her ill ’

            but her watch she did not cease 

            he bless’d her where she sat distraught 

            and show’d her holy cross   

            the cross she kiss’d from year to year  

            but she neither saw nor heard 

            and said he in her deaf ear

            all he had been wont to teach 

            all she had been fond to hear 

            missall’d prayer  and solemn speech 

            but she answer’d not a word 

    only when he turn’d to speak with those who wept about the bed 

    ‘on your lives ’ she shriek’d and cried  ‘he is but newly dead ’

    then how sadly he turn’d from her  it were wonderful to tell 

    and he stood beside the death bed as by one who slumbers well 

    and he lean’d o’er him who lay there  and in cautious whisper low 

    ‘he is not dead  but sleepeth ’ said the priest  and smooth’d his brow 

    ‘sleepeth ’ said she  looking up  and the sun rose in her face 

    ‘he must be better than i thought  for the sleep is very sound ’

    ‘he is better ’ said the priest  and call’d her maidens round 

    with them came that ancient dame who nursed her when a child 

    o nurse ’ she sigh’d  ‘o nurse ’ she cried  ‘o nurse ’ and then she smiled 

            and then she wept  with that they drew

            about her  as of old 

            her dying eyes were sweet and blue 

            her trembling touch was cold 

            but she said  ‘my maidens true 

            no more weeping and well away 

            let them kill the feast 

            i would be happy in my soul 

            “he is better ” saith the priest 

            he did but sleep the weary day 

            and will waken whole 

            carry me to his dear side 

            and let the halls be trim 

            whistly  whistly ’ said she 

            ‘i am wan with watching and wail 

            he must not wake to see me pale 

            let me sleep with him 

            see you keep the tryst for me 

            i would rest till he awake

            and rise up like a bride 

            but whistly  whistly ’ said she 

            ‘yet rejoice your lord doth live 

            and for his dear sake

            say  laus  domine  ’

            silent they cast down their eyes 

            and every breast a sob did rive 

            she lifted her in wild surprise

            and they dared not disobey 

    ‘ laus deo  ’ said the steward  hoary when her days were new 

    ‘ laus deo  ’ said the warrener  whiter than the warren snows 

    ‘ laus deo  ’ the bald henchman  who had nursed her on his knee 

            the old nurse moved her lips in vain 

            and she stood among the train

            like a dead tree shaking dew 

            then the priest he softly slept

            midway in the little band 

            and he took the lady’s hand 

            ‘ laus deo  ’ he said aloud 

            ‘ laus deo  ’ they said again 

            yet again  and yet again 

            humbly cross’d and lowly bow’d 

            till in wont and fear it rose

            to the sabbath strain 





    but she neither turn’d her head

    nor ‘whistly  whistly ’ said she 

    her hands were folded as in grace 

    we laid her with her ancient race

    and all the village wept

    up the airy mountain 

      down the rushy glen 

    we daren’t go a hunting

      for fear of little men 

    wee folk  good folk 

      trooping all together 

    green jacket  red cap 

      and white owl’s feather 



    down along the rocky shore

      some make their home 

    they live on crispy pancakes

      of yellow tide foam 

    some in the reeds

      of the black mountain lake 

    with frogs for their watch dogs 

      all night awake 



    high on the hill top

      the old king sits 

    he is now so old and gray

      he’s nigh lost his wits 





    with a bridge of white mist

      columbkill he crosses 

    on his stately journeys

      from slieveleague to rosses 

    or going up with music

      on cold starry nights

    to sup with the queen

      of the gay northern lights 



    they stole little bridget

      for seven years long 

    when she came down again

      her friends were all gone 

    they took her lightly back 

      between the night and morrow 

    they thought that she was fast asleep 

      but she was dead with sorrow 

    they have kept her ever since

      deep within the lake 

    on a bed of flag leaves 

      watching till she wake 



    by the craggy hill side 

      through the mosses bare 

    they have planted thorn trees

      for pleasure here and there 

    if any man so daring

      as dig them up in spite 

    he shall find their sharpest thorns

      in his bed at night 



    up the airy mountain 

      down the rushy glen 

    we daren’t go a hunting

      for fear of little men 

    wee folk  good folk 

      trooping all together 

    green jacket  red cap 

      and white owl’s feather

 770    that holy thing 



    they all were looking for a king

      to slay their foes and lift them high 

    thou cam’st  a little baby thing

        that made a woman cry 



    o son of man  to right my lot

      naught but thy presence can avail 

    yet on the road thy wheels are not 

        nor on the sea thy sail 



    my how or when thou wilt not heed 

      but come down thine own secret stair 

    that thou mayst answer all my need  

        yea  every bygone prayer

 771    the blessèd damozel 



    the blessèd damozel lean’d out

      from the gold bar of heaven 

    her blue grave eyes were deeper much

      than a deep water  even 

    she had three lilies in her hand 

      and the stars in her hair were seven 





    her robe  ungirt from clasp to hem 

      no wrought flowers did adorn 

    but a white rose of mary’s gift

      on the neck meetly worn 

    and her hair  lying down her back 

      was yellow like ripe corn 



    herseem’d she scarce had been a day

      one of god’s choristers 

    the wonder was not yet quite gone

      from that still look of hers 

    albeit  to them she left  her day

      had counted as ten years 



     to  one  it is ten years of years 

    yet now  here in this place 

    surely she lean’d o’er me   her hair

      fell all about my face    

    nothing  the autumn fall of leaves 

      the whole year sets apace  



    it was the terrace of god’s house

      that she was standing on   

    by god built over the sheer depth

      in which space is begun 

    so high  that looking downward thence 

      she scarce could see the sun 



    it lies from heaven across the flood

      of ether  as a bridge 

    beneath  the tides of day and night

      with flame and darkness ridge

    the void  as low as where this earth

      spins like a fretful midge 





    but in those tracts  with her  it was

      the peace of utter light

    and silence  for no breeze may stir

      along the steady flight

    of seraphim  no echo there 

      beyond all depth or height 



    heard hardly  some of her new friends 

      playing at holy games 

    spake  gentle mouth’d  among themselves 

      their virginal chaste names 

    and the souls  mounting up to god 

      went by her like thin flames 



    and still she bow’d herself  and stoop’d

      into the vast waste calm 

    till her bosom’s pressure must have made

      the bar she lean’d on warm 

    and the lilies lay as if asleep

      along her bended arm 



    from the fixt lull of heaven  she saw

      time  like a pulse  shake fierce

    through all the worlds  her gaze still strove 

      in that steep gulf  to pierce

    the swarm  and then she spoke  as when

      the stars sang in their spheres 



    ‘i wish that he were come to me 

      for he will come ’ she said 

    ‘have i not pray’d in solemn heaven 

      on earth  has he not pray’d 

    are not two prayers a perfect strength 

      and shall i feel afraid 





    ‘when round his head the aureole clings 

      and he is clothed in white 

    i’ll take his hand  and go with him

      to the deep wells of light 

    and we will step down as to a stream

      and bathe there in god’s sight 



    ‘we two will stand beside that shrine 

      occult  withheld  untrod 

    whose lamps tremble continually

      with prayer sent up to god 

    and where each need  reveal’d  expects

      its patient period 



    ‘we two will lie i’ the shadow of

      that living mystic tree

    within whose secret growth the dove

      sometimes is felt to be 

    while every leaf that his plumes touch

      saith his name audibly 



    ‘and i myself will teach to him   

      i myself  lying so   

    the songs i sing here  which his mouth

      shall pause in  hush’d and slow 

    finding some knowledge at each pause 

      and some new thing to know ’



     alas  to  her  wise simple mind

      these things were all but known

    before  they trembled on her sense   

      her voice had caught their tone 

    alas for lonely heaven  alas

      for life wrung out alone 





    alas  and though the end were reach’d    

      was  thy  part understood

    or borne in trust  and for her sake

      shall this too be found good   

    may the close lips that knew not prayer

      praise ever  though they would  



    ‘we two ’ she said  ‘will seek the groves

      where the lady mary is 

    with her five handmaidens  whose names

      are five sweet symphonies   

    cecily  gertrude  magdalen 

      margaret and rosalys 



    ‘circle wise sit they  with bound locks

      and bosoms coverèd 

    into the fine cloth  white like flame 

      weaving the golden thread 

    to fashion the birth robes for them

      who are just born  being dead 



    ‘he shall fear  haply  and be dumb 

      then i will lay my cheek

    to his  and tell about our love 

      not once abash’d or weak 

    and the dear mother will approve

      my pride  and let me speak 



    ‘herself shall bring us  hand in hand 

      to him round whom all souls

    kneel  the unnumber’d solemn heads

      bow’d with their aureoles 

    and angels  meeting us  shall sing

      to their citherns and citoles 





    ‘there will i ask of christ the lord

      thus much for him and me   

    to have more blessing than on earth

      in nowise  but to be

    as then we were   being as then

      at peace  yea  verily 



    ‘yea  verily  when he is come

      we will do thus and thus 

    till this my vigil seem quite strange

      and almost fabulous 

    we two will live at once  one life 

      and peace shall be with us ’



    she gazed  and listen’d  and then said 

      less sad of speech than mild   

    ‘all this is when he comes ’ she ceased 

      the light thrill’d past her  fill’d

    with angels  in strong level lapse 

      her eyes pray’d  and she smiled 



     i saw her smile   but soon their flight

      was vague ’mid the poised spheres 

    and then she cast her arms along

      the golden barriers 

    and laid her face between her hands 

      and wept   i heard her tears

 772    love in the valley 



    under yonder beech tree single on the green sward 

      couch’d with her arms behind her golden head 

    knees and tresses folded to slip and ripple idly 

      lies my young love sleeping in the shade 

    had i the heart to slide an arm beneath her 

      press her parting lips as her waist i gather slow 

    waking in amazement she could not but embrace me 

      then would she hold me and never let me go 



                                            



    shy as the squirrel and wayward as the swallow 

      swift as the swallow along the river’s light

    circleting the surface to meet his mirror’d winglets 

      fleeter she seems in her stay than in her flight 

    shy as the squirrel that leaps among the pine tops 

      wayward as the swallow overhead at set of sun 

    she whom i love is hard to catch and conquer 

      hard  but o the glory of the winning were she won 



                                            



    when her mother tends her before the laughing mirror 

      tying up her laces  looping up her hair 

    often she thinks  were this wild thing wedded 

      more love should i have  and much less care 

    when her mother tends her before the lighted mirror 

      loosening her laces  combing down her curls 

    often she thinks  were this wild thing wedded 

      i should miss but one for many boys and girls 



                                            





    heartless she is as the shadow in the meadows

      flying to the hills on a blue and breezy noon 

    no  she is athirst and drinking up her wonder 

      earth to her is young as the slip of the new moon 

    deals she an unkindness  ’tis but her rapid measure 

      even as in a dance  and her smile can heal no less 

    like the swinging may cloud that pelts the flowers with hailstones

      off a sunny border  she was made to bruise and bless 



                                            



    lovely are the curves of the white owl sweeping

      wavy in the dusk lit by one large star 

    lone on the fir branch  his rattle note unvaried 

      brooding o’er the gloom  spins the brown evejar 

    darker grows the valley  more and more forgetting 

      so were it with me if forgetting could be will’d 

    tell the grassy hollow that holds the bubbling well spring 

      tell it to forget the source that keeps it fill’d 



                                            



    stepping down the hill with her fair companions 

      arm in arm  all against the raying west 

    boldly she sings  to the merry tune she marches 

      brave is her shape  and sweeter unpossess’d 

    sweeter  for she is what my heart first awaking

      whisper’d the world was  morning light is she 

    love that so desires would fain keep her changeless 

      fain would fling the net  and fain have her free 



                                            



    happy happy time  when the white star hovers

      low over dim fields fresh with bloomy dew 

    near the face of dawn  that draws athwart the darkness 

      threading it with colour  like yewberries the yew 

    thicker crowd the shades as the grave east deepens

      glowing  and with crimson a long cloud swells 

    maiden still the morn is  and strange she is  and secret 

      strange her eyes  her cheeks are cold as cold sea shells 



                                            



    sunrays  leaning on our southern hills and lighting

      wild cloud mountains that drag the hills along 

    oft ends the day of your shifting brilliant laughter

      chill as a dull face frowning on a song 

    ay  but shows the south west a ripple feather’d bosom

      blown to silver while the clouds are shaken and ascend

    scaling the mid heavens as they stream  there comes a sunset

      rich  deep like love in beauty without end 



                                            



    when at dawn she sighs  and like an infant to the window

      turns grave eyes craving light  released from dreams 

    beautiful she looks  like a white water lily

      bursting out of bud in havens of the streams 

    when from bed she rises clothed from neck to ankle

      in her long nightgown sweet as boughs of may 

    beautiful she looks  like a tall garden lily

      pure from the night  and splendid for the day 



                                            



    mother of the dews  dark eye lash’d twilight 

      low lidded twilight  o’er the valley’s brim 

    rounding on thy breast sings the dew delighted skylark 

      clear as though the dewdrops had their voice in him 

    hidden where the rose flush drinks the rayless planet 

      fountain full he pours the spraying fountain showers 

    let me hear her laughter  i would have her ever

      cool as dew in twilight  the lark above the flowers 



                                            





    all the girls are out with their baskets for the primrose 

      up lanes  woods through  they troop in joyful bands 

    my sweet leads  she knows not why  but now she loiters 

      eyes the bent anemones  and hangs her hands 

    such a look will tell that the violets are peeping 

      coming the rose  and unaware a cry

    springs in her bosom for odours and for colour 

      covert and the nightingale  she knows not why 



                                            



    kerchief’d head and chin she darts between her tulips 

      streaming like a willow gray in arrowy rain 

    some bend beaten cheek to gravel  and their angel

      she will be  she lifts them  and on she speeds again 

    black the driving raincloud breasts the iron gateway 

      she is forth to cheer a neighbour lacking mirth 

    so when sky and grass met rolling dumb for thunder

      saw i once a white dove  sole light of earth 



                                            



    prim little scholars are the flowers of her garden 

      train’d to stand in rows  and asking if they please 

    i might love them well but for loving more the wild ones 

      o my wild ones  they tell me more than these 

    you  my wild one  you tell of honied field rose 

      violet  blushing eglantine in life  and even as they 

    they by the wayside are earnest of your goodness 

      you are of life’s  on the banks that line the way 



                                            



    peering at her chamber the white crowns the red rose 

      jasmine winds the porch with stars two and three 

    parted is the window  she sleeps  the starry jasmine

      breathes a falling breath that carries thoughts of me 

    sweeter unpossessed  have i said of her my sweetest 

      not while she sleeps  while she sleeps the jasmine breathes 

    luring her to love  she sleeps  the starry jasmine

      bears me to her pillow under white rose wreaths 



                                            



    yellow with birdfoot trefoil are the grass glades 

      yellow with cinquefoil of the dew gray leaf 

    yellow with stonecrop  the moss mounds are yellow 

      blue neck’d the wheat sways  yellowing to the sheaf 

    green yellow  bursts from the copse the laughing yaffle 

      sharp as a sickle is the edge of shade and shine 

    earth in her heart laughs looking at the heavens 

      thinking of the harvest  i look and think of mine 



                                            



    this i may know  her dressing and undressing

      such a change of light shows as when the skies in sport

    shift from cloud to moonlight  or edging over thunder

      slips a ray of sun  or sweeping into port

    white sails furl  or on the ocean borders

      white sails lean along the waves leaping green 

    visions of her shower before me  but from eyesight

      guarded she would be like the sun were she seen 



                                            



    front door and back of the moss’d old farmhouse

      open with the morn  and in a breezy link

    freshly sparkles garden to stripe shadow’d orchard 

      green across a rill where on sand the minnows wink 

    busy in the grass the early sun of summer

      swarms  and the blackbird’s mellow fluting notes

    call my darling up with round and roguish challenge 

      quaintest  richest carol of all the singing throats 



                                            





    cool was the woodside  cool as her white dairy

      keeping sweet the cream pan  and there the boys from school 

    cricketing below  rush’d brown and red with sunshine 

      o the dark translucence of the deep eyed cool 

    spying from the farm  herself she fetch’d a pitcher

      full of milk  and tilted for each in turn the beak 

    then a little fellow  mouth up and on tiptoe 

      said  ‘i will kiss you’  she laugh’d and lean’d her cheek 



                                            



    doves of the fir wood walling high our red roof

      through the long noon coo  crooning through the coo 

    loose droop the leaves  and down the sleepy roadway

      sometimes pipes a chaffinch  loose droops the blue 

    cows flap a slow tail knee deep in the river 

      breathless  given up to sun and gnat and fly 

    nowhere is she seen  and if i see her nowhere 

      lightning may come  straight rains and tiger sky 



                                            



    o the golden sheaf  the rustling treasure armful 

      o the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced 

    o the treasure tresses one another over

      nodding  o the girdle slack about the waist 

    slain are the poppies that shot their random scarlet

      quick amid the wheat ears  wound about the waist 

    gathered  see these brides of earth one blush of ripeness 

      o the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced 



                                            



    large and smoky red the sun’s cold disk drops 

      clipped by naked hills  on violet shaded snow 

    eastward large and still lights up a bower of moonrise 

      whence at her leisure steps the moon aglow 

    nightlong on black print branches our beech tree

      gazes in this whiteness  nightlong could i 

    here may life on death or death on life be painted 

      let me clasp her soul to know she cannot die 



                                            



    gossips count her faults  they scour a narrow chamber

      where there is no window  read not heaven or her 

    ‘when she was a tiny ’ one agèd woman quavers 

      plucks at my heart and leads me by the ear 

    faults she had once as she learn’d to run and tumbled 

      faults of feature some see  beauty not complete 

    yet  good gossips  beauty that makes holy

      earth and air  may have faults from head to feet 



    hither she comes  she comes to me  she lingers 

      deepens her brown eyebrows  while in new surprise

    high rise the lashes in wonder of a stranger 

      yet am i the light and living of her eyes 

    something friends have told her fills her heart to brimming 

      nets her in her blushes  and wounds her  and tames   

    sure of her haven  o like a dove alighting 

      arms up  she dropp’d  our souls were in our names 



                                            



    soon will she lie like a white frost sunrise 

      yellow oats and brown wheat  barley pale as rye 

    long since your sheaves have yielded to the thresher 

      felt the girdle loosen’d  seen the tresses fly 

    soon will she lie like a blood red sunset 

      swift with the to morrow  green wing’d spring 

    sing from the south west  bring her back the truants 

      nightingale and swallow  song and dipping wing 



                                            





    soft new beech leaves  up to beamy april

      spreading bough on bough a primrose mountain  you

    lucid in the moon  raise lilies to the skyfields 

      youngest green transfused in silver shining through 

    fairer than the lily  than the wild white cherry 

      fair as in image my seraph love appears

    borne to me by dreams when dawn is at my eyelids 

      fair as in the flesh she swims to me on tears 



                                            



    could i find a place to be alone with heaven 

      i would speak my heart out  heaven is my need 

    every woodland tree is flushing like the dogwood 

      flashing like the whitebeam  swaying like the reed 

    flushing like the dogwood crimson in october 

      streaming like the flag reed south west blown 

    flashing as in gusts the sudden lighted whitebeam 

      all seem to know what is for heaven alone 





 773    phœbus with admetus 



    when by zeus relenting the mandate was revoked 

      sentencing to exile the bright sun god 

    mindful were the ploughmen of who the steer had yoked 

      who  and what a track show’d the upturn’d sod 

    mindful were the shepherds  as now the noon severe

      bent a burning eyebrow to brown evetide 

    how the rustic flute drew the silver to the sphere 

      sister of his own  till her rays fell wide 

                god  of whom music

                and song and blood are pure 

                the day is never darken’d

                that had thee here obscure 





    chirping none  the scarlet cicalas crouch’d in ranks 

      slack the thistle head piled its down silk gray 

    scarce the stony lizard suck’d hollows in his flanks 

      thick on spots of umbrage our drowsed flocks lay 

    sudden bow’d the chestnuts beneath a wind unheard 

      lengthen’d ran the grasses  the sky grew slate 

    then amid a swift flight of wing’d seed white as curd 

      clear of limb a youth smote the master’s gate 

                god  of whom music

                and song and blood are pure 

                the day is never darken’d

                that had thee here obscure 



    water  first of singers  o’er rocky mount and mead 

      first of earthly singers  the sun loved rill 

    sang of him  and flooded the ripples on the reed 

      seeking whom to waken and what ear fill 

    water  sweetest soother to kiss a wound and cool 

      sweetest and divinest  the sky born brook 

    chuckled  with a whimper  and made a mirror pool

      round the guest we welcomed  the strange hand shook 

                god  of whom music

                and song and blood are pure 

                the day is never darken’d

                that had thee here obscure 



    many swarms of wild bees descended on our fields 

      stately stood the wheatstalk with head bent high 

    big of heart we labour’d at storing mighty yields 

      wool and corn  and clusters to make men cry 

    hand like rush’d the vintage  we strung the bellied skins

      plump  and at the sealing the youth’s voice rose 

    maidens clung in circle  on little fists their chins 

      gentle beasties through push’d a cold long nose 

                god  of whom music

                and song and blood are pure 

                the day is never darken’d

                that had thee here obscure 



    foot to fire in snowtime we trimm’d the slender shaft 

      often down the pit spied the lean wolf’s teeth

    grin against his will  trapp’d by masterstrokes of craft 

      helpless in his froth wrath as green logs seethe 

    safe the tender lambs tugg’d the teats  and winter sped

      whirl’d before the crocus  the year’s new gold 

    hung the hooky beak up aloft  the arrowhead

      redden’d through his feathers for our dear fold 

                god  of whom music

                and song and blood are pure 

                the day is never darkened

                that had thee here obscure 



    tales we drank of giants at war with gods above 

      rocks were they to look on  and earth climb’d air 

    tales of search for simples  and those who sought of love

      ease because the creature was all too fair 

    pleasant ran our thinking that while our work was good 

      sure as fruits for sweat would the praise come fast 

    he that wrestled stoutest and tamed the billow brood

      danced in rings with girls  like a sail flapp’d mast 

                god  of whom music

                and song and blood are pure 

                the day is never darken’d

                that had thee here obscure 



    lo  the herb of healing  when once the herb is known 

      shines in shady woods bright as new sprung flame 

    ere the string was tighten’d we heard the mellow tone 

      after he had taught how the sweet sounds came 

    stretch’d about his feet  labour done  ’twas as you see

      red pomegranates tumble and burst hard rind 

    so began contention to give delight and be

      excellent in things aim’d to make life kind 

                god  of whom music

                and song and blood are pure 

                the day is never darken’d

                that had thee here obscure 



    you with shelly horns  rams  and  promontory goats 

      you whose browsing beards dip in coldest dew 

    bulls  that walk the pastures in kingly flashing coats 

      laurel  ivy  vine  wreathed for feasts not few 

    you that build the shade roof  and you that court the rays 

      you that leap besprinkling the rock stream rent 

    he has been our fellow  the morning of our days 

      us he chose for housemates  and this way went 

                god  of whom music

                and song and blood are pure 

                the day is never darken’d

 774    tardy spring 



        now the north wind ceases 

        the warm south west awakes 

        swift fly the fleeces 

        thick the blossom flakes 



    now hill to hill has made the stride 

    and distance waves the without end 

    now in the breast a door flings wide 

    our farthest smiles  our next is friend 

    and song of england’s rush of flowers

    is this full breeze with mellow stops 

    that spins the lark for shine  for showers 

    he drinks his hurried flight  and drops 

    the stir in memory seem these things 

    which out of moisten’d turf and clay 

    astrain for light push patient rings 

    or leap to find the waterway 

    ’tis equal to a wonder done 

    whatever simple lives renew

    their tricks beneath the father sun 

    as though they caught a broken clue 

    so hard was earth an eyewink back 

    but now the common life has come 

    the blotting cloud a dappled pack 

    the grasses one vast underhum 

    a city clothed in snow and soot 

    with lamps for day in ghostly rows 

    breaks to the scene of hosts afoot 

    the river that reflective flows 

    and there did fog down crypts of street

    play spectre upon eye and mouth   

    their faces are a glass to greet

    this magic of the whirl for south 

    a burly joy each creature swells

    with sound of its own hungry quest 

    earth has to fill her empty wells 

    and speed the service of the nest 

    the phantom of the snow wreath melt 

    that haunts the farmer’s look abroad 

    who sees what tomb a white night built 

    where flocks now bleat and sprouts the clod 

    for iron winter held her firm 

    across her sky he laid his hand 

    and bird he starved  he stiffen’d worm 

    a sightless heaven  a shaven land 

    her shivering spring feign’d fast asleep 

    the bitten buds dared not unfold 

    we raced on roads and ice to keep

    thought of the girl we love from cold 



        but now the north wind ceases 

        the warm south west awakes 

        the heavens are out in fleeces 

        and earth’s green banner shakes 





 775    love’s grave 



    mark where the pressing wind shoots javelin like 

    its skeleton shadow on the broad back’d wave 

    here is a fitting spot to dig love’s grave 

    here where the ponderous breakers plunge and strike 

    and dart their hissing tongues high up the sand 

    in hearing of the ocean  and in sight

    of those ribb’d wind streaks running into white 

    if i the death of love had deeply plann’d 

    i never could have made it half so sure 

    as by the unblest kisses which upbraid

    the full waked sense  or failing that  degrade 

    ’tis morning  but no morning can restore

    what we have forfeited  i see no sin 

    the wrong is mix’d  in tragic life  god wot 

    no villain need be  passions spin the plot 

    we are betray’d by what is false within 





 776    lucifer in starlight 



    on a starr’d night prince lucifer uprose 

      tired of his dark dominion swung the fiend

      above the rolling ball in cloud part screen’d 

    where sinners hugg’d their spectre of repose 

    poor prey to his hot fit of pride were those 

      and now upon his western wing he lean’d 

      now his huge bulk o’er afric’s sands careen’d 

    now the black planet shadow’d arctic snows 

    soaring through wider zones that prick’d his scars

      with memory of the old revolt from awe 

    he reach’d a middle height  and at the stars 

    which are the brain of heaven  he look’d  and sank 

    around the ancient track march’d  rank on rank 

      the army of unalterable law

 777    love 



    the fierce exulting worlds  the motes in rays 

      the churlish thistles  scented briers 

    the wind swept bluebells on the sunny braes 

      down to the central fires 



    exist alike in love  love is a sea

      filling all the abysses dim

    of lornest space  in whose deeps regally

      suns and their bright broods swim 



    this mighty sea of love  with wondrous tides 

      is sternly just to sun and grain 

    ’tis laving at this moment saturn’s sides 

      ’tis in my blood and brain 





    all things have something more than barren use 

      there is a scent upon the brier 

    a tremulous splendour in the autumn dews 

      cold morns are fringed with fire 



    the clodded earth goes up in sweet breath’d flowers 

      in music dies poor human speech 

    and into beauty blow those hearts of ours

      when love is born in each 



    daisies are white upon the churchyard sod 

      sweet tears the clouds lean down and give 

    the world is very lovely  o my god 

      i thank thee that i live 





 778    barbara 



          on the sabbath day 

          through the churchyard old and gray 

    over the crisp and yellow leaves i held my rustling way 

    and amid the words of mercy  falling on my soul like balms 

    ’mid the gorgeous storms of music  in the mellow organ calms 

    ’mid the upward streaming prayers  and the rich and solemn psalms 

          i stood careless  barbara 



          my heart was otherwhere 

          while the organ shook the air 

    and the priest  with outspread hands  bless’d the people with a prayer 

    but when rising to go homeward  with a mild and saint like shine

    gleam’d a face of airy beauty with its heavenly eyes on mine  

    gleam’d and vanish’d in a moment  o that face was surely thine

          out of heaven  barbara 



          o pallid  pallid face 

          o earnest eyes of grace 

    when last i saw thee  dearest  it was in another place 

    you came running forth to meet me with my love gift on your wrist 

    the flutter of a long white dress  then all was lost in mist  

    a purple stain of agony was on the mouth i kiss’d 

          that wild morning  barbara 



          i searched  in my despair 

          sunny noon and midnight air 

    i could not drive away the thought that you were lingering there 

    o many and many a winter night i sat when you were gone 

    my worn face buried in my hands  beside the fire alone  

    within the dripping churchyard  the rain plashing on your stone 

          you were sleeping  barbara 



          ’mong angels  do you think

          of the precious golden link

    i clasp’d around your happy arm while sitting by yon brink 

    or when that night of gliding dance  of laughter and guitars 

    was emptied of its music  and we watch’d  through lattice bars 

    the silent midnight heaven creeping o’er us with its stars 

          till the day broke  barbara 





          in the years i’ve changed 

          wild and far my heart has ranged 

    and many sins and errors now have been on me avenged 

    but to you i have been faithful whatsoever good i lack’d 

    i loved you  and above my life still hangs that love intact  

    your love the trembling rainbow  i the reckless cataract 

          still i love you  barbara 



          yet  love  i am unblest 

          with many doubts opprest 

    i wander like the desert wind without a place of rest 

    could i but win you for an hour from off that starry shore 

    the hunger of my soul were still’d  for death hath told you more

    than the melancholy world doth know  things deeper than all lore

          you could teach me  barbara 



          in vain  in vain  in vain 

          you will never come again 

    there droops upon the dreary hills a mournful fringe of rain 

    the gloaming closes slowly round  loud winds are in the tree 

    round selfish shores for ever moans the hurt and wounded sea 

    there is no rest upon the earth  peace is with death and thee  

          barbara

 779    bride song 



from ‘the prince’s progress’



    too late for love  too late for joy 

      too late  too late 

    you loiter’d on the road too long 

      you trifled at the gate 

    the enchanted dove upon her branch

      died without a mate 

    the enchanted princess in her tower

      slept  died  behind the grate 

    her heart was starving all this while

      you made it wait 



    ten years ago  five years ago 

      one year ago 

    even then you had arrived in time 

      though somewhat slow 

    then you had known her living face

      which now you cannot know 

    the frozen fountain would have leap’d 

      the buds gone on to blow 

    the warm south wind would have awaked

      to melt the snow 



    is she fair now as she lies 

      once she was fair 

    meet queen for any kingly king 

      with gold dust on her hair 

    now there are poppies in her locks 

      white poppies she must wear 

    must wear a veil to shroud her face

      and the want graven there 

    or is the hunger fed at length 

      cast off the care 



    we never saw her with a smile

      or with a frown 

    her bed seem’d never soft to her 

      though toss’d of down 

    she little heeded what she wore 

      kirtle  or wreath  or gown 

    we think her white brows often ached

      beneath her crown 

    till silvery hairs show’d in her locks

      that used to be so brown 



    we never heard her speak in haste 

      her tones were sweet 

    and modulated just so much

      as it was meet 

    her heart sat silent through the noise

      and concourse of the street 

    there was no hurry in her hands 

      no hurry in her feet 

    there was no bliss drew nigh to her 

      that she might run to greet 



    you should have wept her yesterday 

      wasting upon her bed 

    but wherefore should you weep to day

      that she is dead 

    lo  we who love weep not to day 

      but crown her royal head 

    let be these poppies that we strew 

      your roses are too red 

    let be these poppies  not for you

      cut down and spread 





 780    a birthday 



    my heart is like a singing bird

      whose nest is in a water’d shoot 

    my heart is like an apple tree

      whose boughs are bent with thick set fruit 

    my heart is like a rainbow shell

      that paddles in a halcyon sea 

    my heart is gladder than all these 

      because my love is come to me 



    raise me a daïs of silk and down 

      hang it with vair and purple dyes 

    carve it in doves and pomegranates 

      and peacocks with a hundred eyes 

    work it in gold and silver grapes 

      in leaves and silver fleurs de lys 

    because the birthday of my life

      is come  my love is come to me 





 781    song 



    when i am dead  my dearest 

      sing no sad songs for me 

    plant thou no roses at my head 

      nor shady cypress tree 

    be the green grass above me

      with showers and dewdrops wet 

    and if thou wilt  remember 

      and if thou wilt  forget 



    i shall not see the shadows 

      i shall not feel the rain 

    i shall not hear the nightingale

      sing on  as if in pain 

    and dreaming through the twilight

      that doth not rise nor set 

    haply i may remember 

      and haply may forget 





 782    twice 



    i took my heart in my hand

       o my love  o my love  

    i said  let me fall or stand 

      let me live or die 

    but this once hear me speak

       o my love  o my love   

    yet a woman’s words are weak 

      you should speak  not i 



    you took my heart in your hand

      with a friendly smile 

    with a critical eye you scann’d 

      then set it down 

    and said  ‘it is still unripe 

      better wait awhile 

    wait while the skylarks pipe 

      till the corn grows brown ’





    as you set it down it broke  

      broke  but i did not wince 

    i smiled at the speech you spoke 

      at your judgement i heard 

    but i have not often smiled

      since then  nor question’d since 

    nor cared for cornflowers wild 

      nor sung with the singing bird 



    i take my heart in my hand 

      o my god  o my god 

    my broken heart in my hand 

      thou hast seen  judge thou 

    my hope was written on sand 

      o my god  o my god 

    now let thy judgement stand  

      yea  judge me now 



    this contemn’d of a man 

      this marr’d one heedless day 

    this heart take thou to scan

      both within and without 

    refine with fire its gold 

      purge thou its dross away  

    yea  hold it in thy hold 

      whence none can pluck it out 



    i take my heart in my hand  

      i shall not die  but live  

    before thy face i stand 

      i  for thou callest such 

    all that i have i bring 

      all that i am i give 

    smile thou and i shall sing 

      but shall not question much 





 783    uphill 



    does the road wind uphill all the way 

      yes  to the very end 

    will the day’s journey take the whole long day 

      from morn to night  my friend 



    but is there for the night a resting place 

      a roof for when the slow  dark hours begin 

    may not the darkness hide it from my face 

      you cannot miss that inn 



    shall i meet other wayfarers at night 

      those who have gone before 

    then must i knock  or call when just in sight 

      they will not keep you waiting at that door 



    shall i find comfort  travel sore and weak 

      of labour you shall find the sum 

    will there be beds for me and all who seek 

      yea  beds for all who come 





 784    passing away 



    passing away  saith the world  passing away 

    chances  beauty and youth sapp’d day by day 

    thy life never continueth in one stay 

    is the eye waxen dim  is the dark hair changing to gray

    that hath won neither laurel nor bay 

    i shall clothe myself in spring and bud in may 

    thou  root stricken  shalt not rebuild thy decay

    on my bosom for aye 

    then i answer’d  yea 





    passing away  saith my soul  passing away 

    with its burden of fear and hope  of labour and play 

    hearken what the past doth witness and say 

    rust in thy gold  a moth is in thine array 

    a canker is in thy bud  thy leaf must decay 

    at midnight  at cockcrow  at morning  one certain day 

    lo  the bridegroom shall come and shall not delay 

    watch thou and pray 

    then i answer’d  yea 



    passing away  saith my god  passing away 

    winter passeth after the long delay 

    new grapes on the vine  new figs on the tender spray 

    turtle calleth turtle in heaven’s may 

    though i tarry  wait for me  trust me  watch and pray 

    arise  come away  night is past  and lo  it is day 

    my love  my sister  my spouse  thou shalt hear me say  

    then i answer’d  yea 





 785    marvel of marvels 



    marvel of marvels  if i myself shall behold

    with mine own eyes my king in his city of gold 

    where the least of lambs is spotless white in the fold 

    where the least and last of saints in spotless white is stoled 

    where the dimmest head beyond a moon is aureoled 

    o saints  my belovèd  now mouldering to mould in the mould 

    shall i see you lift your heads  see your cerements unroll’d 

    see with these very eyes  who now in darkness and cold

    tremble for the midnight cry  the rapture  the tale untold   

     the bridegroom cometh  cometh  his bride to enfold  



    cold it is  my belovèd  since your funeral bell was toll’d 

    cold it is  o my king  how cold alone on the wold 





 786    is it well with the child  



    safe where i cannot die yet 

      safe where i hope to lie too 

    safe from the fume and the fret 

          you  and you 

      whom i never forget 

    safe from the frost and the snow 

      safe from the storm and the sun 

    safe where the seeds wait to grow

          one by one 

      and to come back in blow 





 787    remember 



    remember me when i am gone away 

      gone far away into the silent land 

      when you can no more hold me by the hand 

    nor i half turn to go  yet turning stay 

    remember me when no more day by day

      you tell me of our future that you plann’d 

      only remember me  you understand

    it will be late to counsel then or pray 

    yet if you should forget me for a while

      and afterwards remember  do not grieve 

      for if the darkness and corruption leave

      a vestige of the thoughts that once i had 

    better by far you should forget and smile

      than that you should remember and be sad 





 788    aloof 



    the irresponsive silence of the land 

      the irresponsive sounding of the sea 

      speak both one message of one sense to me   

    aloof  aloof  we stand aloof  so stand

    thou too aloof  bound with the flawless band

      of inner solitude  we bind not thee 

      but who from thy self chain shall set thee free 

    what heart shall touch thy heart  what hand thy hand 

    and i am sometimes proud and sometimes meek 

      and sometimes i remember days of old

    when fellowship seem’d not so far to seek 

      and all the world and i seem’d much less cold 

      and at the rainbow’s foot lay surely gold 

    and hope felt strong  and life itself not weak 





 789    rest 



    o earth  lie heavily upon her eyes 

      seal her sweet eyes weary of watching  earth 

      lie close around her  leave no room for mirth

    with its harsh laughter  nor for sound of sighs 

    she hath no questions  she hath no replies 

      hush’d in and curtain’d with a blessèd dearth

      of all that irk’d her from the hour of birth 

    with stillness that is almost paradise 

    darkness more clear than noonday holdeth her 

      silence more musical than any song 

    even her very heart has ceased to stir 

    until the morning of eternity

    her rest shall not begin nor end  but be 

      and when she wakes she will not think it long

 790    dora 



    she knelt upon her brother’s grave 

      my little girl of six years old  

    he used to be so good and brave 

      the sweetest lamb of all our fold 

    he used to shout  he used to sing 

    of all our tribe the little king  

    and so unto the turf her ear she laid 

    to hark if still in that dark place he play’d 

        no sound  no sound 

        death’s silence was profound 

        and horror crept

        into her aching heart  and dora wept 

        if this is as it ought to be 

        my god  i leave it unto thee 





 791    jessie 



    when jessie comes with her soft breast 

      and yields the golden keys 

    then is it as if god caress’d

      twin babes upon his knees  

    twin babes that  each to other press’d 

    just feel the father’s arms  wherewith they both are bless’d 



    but when i think if we must part 

      and all this personal dream be fled  

    o then my heart  o then my useless heart 

      would god that thou wert dead  

    a clod insensible to joys and ills  

    a stone remote in some bleak gully of the hills 





 792    salve  



    to live within a cave  it is most good 

        but  if god make a day 

        and some one come  and say 

    ‘lo  i have gather’d faggots in the wood ’

        e’en let him stay 

    and light a fire  and fan a temporal mood 



    so sit till morning  when the light is grown

        that he the path can read 

        then bid the man god speed 

    his morning is not thine  yet must thou own

    they have a cheerful warmth  those ashes on the stone 





 793    my garden 



    a garden is a lovesome thing  god wot 

      rose plot 

      fringed pool 

    fern’d grot  

      the veriest school

      of peace  and yet the fool

    contends that god is not  

    not god  in gardens  when the eve is cool 

      nay  but i have a sign 

      ’tis very sure god walks in mine

 794    a night in italy 



    sweet are the rosy memories of the lips

      that first kiss’d ours  albeit they kiss no more 

    sweet is the sight of sunset sailing ships 

      altho’ they leave us on a lonely shore 

    sweet are familiar songs  tho’ music dips

      her hollow shell in thought’s forlornest wells 

      and sweet  tho’ sad  the sound of midnight bells

    when the oped casement with the night rain drips 



    there is a pleasure which is born of pain 

      the grave of all things hath its violet 

    else why  thro’ days which never come again 

      roams hope with that strange longing  like regret 

    why put the posy in the cold dead hand 

      why plant the rose above the lonely grave 

      why bring the corpse across the salt sea wave 

    why deem the dead more near in native land 



    thy name hath been a silence in my life

      so long  it falters upon language now 

    o more to me than sister or than wife 

      once     and now  nothing  it is hard to know

    that such things have been  and are not  and yet

      life loiters  keeps a pulse at even measure 

      and goes upon its business and its pleasure 

    and knows not all the depths of its regret    



    ah  could the memory cast her spots  as do

      the snake’s brood theirs in spring  and be once more

    wholly renew’d  to dwell i’ the time that’s new 

      with no reiterance of those pangs of yore 

    peace  peace  my wild song will go wandering

      too wantonly  down paths a private pain

      hath trodden bare  what was it jarr’d the strain 

    some crush’d illusion  left with crumpled wing



    tangled in music’s web of twinèd strings  

      that started that false note  and crack’d the tune

    in its beginning  ah  forgotten things

      stumble back strangely  and the ghost of june

    stands by december’s fire  cold  cold  and puts

      the last spark out   how could i sing aright

      with those old airs haunting me all the night

    and those old steps that sound when daylight shuts 



    for back she comes  and moves reproachfully 

      the mistress of my moods  and looks bereft

     cruel to the last   as tho’ ’twere i  not she 

      that did the wrong  and broke the spell  and left

    memory comfortless   away  away 

      phantoms  about whose brows the bindweed clings 

      hopeless regret  in thinking of these things

    some men have lost their minds  and others may 



    yet  o for one deep draught in this dull hour 

      one deep  deep draught of the departed time 

    o for one brief strong pulse of ancient power 

      to beat and breathe thro’ all the valves of rhyme 

    thou  memory  with thy downward eyes  that art

      the cup bearer of gods  pour deep and long 

      brim all the vacant chalices of song

    with health  droop down thine urn  i hold my heart

    one draught of what i shall not taste again

      save when my brain with thy dark wine is brimm’d   

    one draught  and then straight onward  spite of pain 

      and spite of all things changed  with gaze undimm’d 

    love’s footsteps thro’ the waning past to explore

      undaunted  and to carve in the wan light

      of hope’s last outposts  on song’s utmost height 

    the sad resemblance of an hour or more 



    midnight  and love  and youth  and italy 

      love in the land where love most lovely seems 

    land of my love  tho’ i be far from thee 

      lend  for love’s sake  the light of thy moonbeams 

    the spirit of thy cypress groves and all

      thy dark eyed beauty for a little while

      to my desire  yet once more let her smile

    fall o’er me  o’er me let her long hair fall    



    under the blessèd darkness unreproved

      we were alone  in that best hour of time

    which first reveal’d to us how much we loved 

      ’neath the thick starlight  the young night sublime

    hung trembling o’er us  at her feet i knelt 

      and gazed up from her feet into her eyes 

      her face was bow’d  we breathed each other’s sighs 

    we did not speak  not move  we look’d  we felt 



    the night said not a word  the breeze was dead 

      the leaf lay without whispering on the tree 

    as i lay at her feet  droop’d was her head 

      one hand in mine  and one still pensively

    went wandering through my hair  we were together 

      how  where  what matter  somewhere in a dream 

      drifting  slow drifting down a wizard stream 

    whither  together  then what matter whither 



    it was enough for me to clasp her hand 

      to blend with her love looks my own  no more 

    enough  with thoughts like ships that cannot land 

      blown by faint winds about a magic shore 

    to realize  in each mysterious feeling 

      the droop of the warm cheek so near my own 

      the cool white arm about my shoulder thrown 

    those exquisite fair feet where i was kneeling 



    how little know they life’s divinest bliss 

      that know not to possess and yet refrain 

    let the young psyche roam  a fleeting kiss 

      grasp it  a few poor grains of dust remain 

    see how those floating flowers  the butterflies 

      hover the garden thro’  and take no root 

      desire for ever hath a flying foot 

    free pleasure comes and goes beneath the skies 



    close not thy hand upon the innocent joy

      that trusts itself within thy reach  it may 

    or may not  linger  thou canst but destroy

      the wingèd wanderer  let it go or stay 

    love thou the rose  yet leave it on its stem 

      think  midas starved by turning all to gold 

      blessèd are those that spare  and that withhold 

    because the whole world shall be trusted them 



    the foolish faun pursues the unwilling nymph

      that culls her flowers beside the precipice

    or dips her shining ankles in the lymph 

      but  just when she must perish or be his 

    heaven puts an arm out  she is safe  the shore

      gains some new fountain  or the lilied lawn

      a rarer sort of rose  but ah  poor faun 

    to thee she shall be changed for evermore 



    chase not too close the fading rapture  leave

      to love his long auroras  slowly seen 

    be ready to release as to receive 

      deem those the nearest  soul to soul  between

    whose lips yet lingers reverence on a sigh 

      judge what thy sense can reach not  most thine own 

      if once thy soul hath seized it  the unknown

    is life to love  religion  poetry 



    the moon had set  there was not any light 

      save of the lonely legion’d watch stars pale

    in outer air  and what by fits made bright

      hot oleanders in a rosy vale

    searched by the lamping fly  whose little spark

      went in and out  like passion’s bashful hope 

      meanwhile the sleepy globe began to slope

    a ponderous shoulder sunward thro’ the dark 



    and the night pass’d in beauty like a dream 

      aloof in those dark heavens paused destiny 

    with her last star descending in the gleam

      of the cold morrow  from the emptied sky 

    the hour  the distance from her old self  all

      the novelty and loneness of the place

      had left a lovely awe on that fair face 

    and all the land grew strange and magical 



    as droops some billowy cloud to the crouch’d hill 

      heavy with all heaven’s tears  for all earth’s care 

    she droop’d unto me  without force or will 

      and sank upon my bosom  murmuring there

    a woman’s inarticulate passionate words 

      o moment of all moments upon earth 

      o life’s supreme  how worth  how wildly worth 

    whole worlds of flame  to know this world affords 



    what even eternity can not restore 

      when all the ends of life take hands and meet

    round centres of sweet fire  ah  never more 

      ah never  shall the bitter with the sweet

    be mingled so in the pale after years 

      one hour of life immortal spirits possess 

      this drains the world  and leaves but weariness 

    and parching passion  and perplexing tears 



    sad is it  that we cannot even keep

      that hour to sweeten life’s last toil  but youth

    grasps all  and leaves us  and when we would weep 

      we dare not let our tears fall  lest  in truth 

    they fall upon our work which must be done 

      and so we bind up our torn hearts from breaking 

      our eyes from weeping  and our brows from aching 

    and follow the long pathway all alone 





 795    the last wish 



    since all that i can ever do for thee

    is to do nothing  this my prayer must be 

    that thou mayst never guess nor ever see

    the all endured this nothing done costs me

 796    in the train 



    as we rush  as we rush in the train 

      the trees and the houses go wheeling back 

    but the starry heavens above the plain

      come flying on our track 



    all the beautiful stars of the sky 

      the silver doves of the forest of night 

    over the dull earth swarm and fly 

      companions of our flight 



    we will rush ever on without fear 

      let the goal be far  the flight be fleet 

    for we carry the heavens with us  dear 

      while the earth slips from our feet 





 797    sunday up the river 



    my love o’er the water bends dreaming 

      it glideth and glideth away 

    she sees there her own beauty  gleaming

      through shadow and ripple and spray 



    o tell her  thou murmuring river 

      as past her your light wavelets roll 

    how steadfast that image for ever

      shines pure in pure depths of my soul 





 798    gifts 



    give a man a horse he can ride 

      give a man a boat he can sail 

    and his rank and wealth  his strength and health 

      on sea nor shore shall fail 



    give a man a pipe he can smoke 

      give a man a book he can read 

    and his home is bright with a calm delight 

      though the room be poor indeed 



    give a man a girl he can love 

      as i  o my love  love thee 

    and his heart is great with the pulse of fate 

      at home  on land  on sea 





 799    the vine 



    the wine of love is music 

      and the feast of love is song 

    and when love sits down to the banquet 

        love sits long 



    sits long and arises drunken 

      but not with the feast and the wine 

    he reeleth with his own heart 

        that great  rich vine

 800    summer dawn 



    pray but one prayer for me ’twixt thy closed lips 

      think but one thought of me up in the stars 

    the summer night waneth  the morning light slips

      faint and gray ’twixt the leaves of the aspen  betwixt the cloud bars 

    that are patiently waiting there for the dawn 

      patient and colourless  though heaven’s gold

    waits to float through them along with the sun 

    far out in the meadows  above the young corn 

      the heavy elms wait  and restless and cold

    the uneasy wind rises  the roses are dun 

    through the long twilight they pray for the dawn

    round the lone house in the midst of the corn 

        speak but one word to me over the corn 

        over the tender  bow’d locks of the corn 





 801    love is enough 



    love is enough  though the world be a waning 

    and the woods have no voice but the voice of complaining 

      though the sky be too dark for dim eyes to discover

    the gold cups and daisies fair blooming thereunder 

    though the hills be held shadows  and the sea a dark wonder 

      and this day draw a veil over all deeds pass’d over 

    yet their hands shall not tremble  their feet shall not falter 

    the void shall not weary  the fear shall not alter

      these lips and these eyes of the loved and the lover 





 802    the nymph’s song to hylas 



    i know a little garden close

    set thick with lily and red rose 

    where i would wander if i might

    from dewy dawn to dewy night 

    and have one with me wandering 



    and though within it no birds sing 

    and though no pillar’d house is there 

    and though the apple boughs are bare

    of fruit and blossom  would to god 

    her feet upon the green grass trod 

    and i beheld them as before 



    there comes a murmur from the shore 

    and in the place two fair streams are 

    drawn from the purple hills afar 

    drawn down unto the restless sea 

    the hills whose flowers ne’er fed the bee 

    the shore no ship has ever seen 

    still beaten by the billows green 

    whose murmur comes unceasingly

    unto the place for which i cry 



    for which i cry both day and night 

    for which i let slip all delight 

    that maketh me both deaf and blind 

    careless to win  unskill’d to find 

    and quick to lose what all men seek 



    yet tottering as i am  and weak 

    still have i left a little breath

    to seek within the jaws of death

    an entrance to that happy place 

    to seek the unforgotten face

    once seen  once kiss’d  once reft from me

    anigh the murmuring of the sea

 803    the water nymph and the boy 



    i flung me round him 

    i drew him under 

    i clung  i drown’d him 

    my own white wonder    



      father and mother 

      weeping and wild 

      came to the forest 

      calling the child 

      came from the palace 

      down to the pool 

      calling my darling 

      my beautiful 

      under the water 

      cold and so pale 

      could it be love made

      beauty to fail 



      ah me for mortals 

      in a few moons 

      if i had left him 

      after some junes

      he would have faded 

      faded away 

      he  the young monarch  whom

      all would obey 

      fairer than day 

      alien to springtime 

      joyless and gray 

      he would have faded 

      faded away 

      moving a mockery 

      scorn’d of the day 

      now i have taken him

      all in his prime 

      saved from slow poisoning

      pitiless time 

      fill’d with his happiness 

      one with the prime 

      saved from the cruel

      dishonour of time 

      laid him  my beautiful 

      laid him to rest 

      loving  adorable 

      softly to rest 

      here in my crystalline 

      here in my breast 





 804    the old 



    they are waiting on the shore

      for the bark to take them home 

    they will toil and grieve no more 

      the hour for release hath come 



    all their long life lies behind

      like a dimly blending dream 

    there is nothing left to bind

      to the realms that only seem 



    they are waiting for the boat 

      there is nothing left to do 

    what was near them grows remote 

      happy silence falls like dew 

    now the shadowy bark is come 

      and the weary may go home 



    by still water they would rest

      in the shadow of the tree 

    after battle sleep is best 

      after noise  tranquillity

 805    meet we no angels  pansie  



    came  on a sabbath noon  my sweet 

      in white  to find her lover 

    the grass grew proud beneath her feet 

      the green elm leaves above her   

        meet we no angels  pansie 



    she said  ‘we meet no angels now’ 

      and soft lights stream’d upon her 

    and with white hand she touch’d a bough 

      she did it that great honour   

        what  meet no angels  pansie 



    o sweet brown hat  brown hair  brown eyes 

      down dropp’d brown eyes  so tender 

    then what said i  gallant replies

      seem flattery  and offend her   

        but  meet no angels  pansie 





 806    to two bereaved 



    you must be sad  for though it is to heaven 

    ’tis hard to yield a little girl of seven 

    alas  for me ’tis hard my grief to rule 

    who only met her as she went to school 

    who never heard the little lips so sweet

    say even ‘good morning ’ though our eyes would meet

    as whose would fain be friends  how must you sigh 

    sick for your loss  when even so sad am i 

    who never clasp’d the small hands any day 

    fair flowers thrive round the little grave  i pray

 808    chorus from ‘atalanta’ 



    when the hounds of spring are on winter’s traces 

      the mother of months in meadow or plain

    fills the shadows and windy places

      with lisp of leaves and ripple of rain 

    and the brown bright nightingale amorous

    is half assuaged for itylus 

    for the thracian ships and the foreign faces 

      the tongueless vigil  and all the pain 



    come with bows bent and with emptying of quivers 

      maiden most perfect  lady of light 

    with a noise of winds and many rivers 

      with a clamour of waters  and with might 

    bind on thy sandals  o thou most fleet 

    over the splendour and speed of thy feet 

    for the faint east quickens  the wan west shivers 

      round the feet of the day and the feet of the night 



    where shall we find her  how shall we sing to her 

      fold our hands round her knees  and cling 

    o that man’s heart were as fire and could spring to her 

      fire  or the strength of the streams that spring 

    for the stars and the winds are unto her

    as raiment  as songs of the harp player 

    for the risen stars and the fallen cling to her 

      and the southwest wind and the west wind sing 



    for winter’s rains and ruins are over 

      and all the season of snows and sins 

    the days dividing lover and lover 

      the light that loses  the night that wins 

    and time remember’d is grief forgotten 

    and frosts are slain and flowers begotten 

    and in green underwood and cover

      blossom by blossom the spring begins 



    the full streams feed on flower of rushes 

      ripe grasses trammel a travelling foot 

    the faint fresh flame of the young year flushes

      from leaf to flower and flower to fruit 

    and fruit and leaf are as gold and fire 

    and the oat is heard above the lyre 

    and the hoofèd heel of a satyr crushes

      the chestnut husk at the chestnut root 





    and pan by noon and bacchus by night 

      fleeter of foot than the fleet foot kid 

    follows with dancing and fills with delight

      the mænad and the bassarid 

    and soft as lips that laugh and hide

    the laughing leaves of the trees divide 

    and screen from seeing and leave in sight

      the god pursuing  the maiden hid 



    the ivy falls with the bacchanal’s hair

      over her eyebrows hiding her eyes 

    the wild vine slipping down leaves bare

      her bright breast shortening into sighs 

    the wild vine slips with the weight of its leaves 

    but the berried ivy catches and cleaves

    to the limbs that glitter  the feet that scare

      the wolf that follows  the fawn that flies

                and the arrows that miss 

              i the mouth that is kiss’d

    the search  and the sought  and the seeker  the soul and the body that is 



              i am that thing which blesses

                my spirit elate 

              that which caresses

                with hands uncreate

    my limbs unbegotten that measure the length of the measure of fate 



              but what thing dost thou now 

                looking godward  to cry 

              ‘i am i  thou art thou

                the plough cloven clod

              and the ploughshare drawn thorough 

                the germ and the sod 

    the deed and the doer  the seed and the sower  the dust which is god 



              hast thou known how i fashion’d thee

              fire that impassion’d thee 

                iron that bound 

    dim changes of water  what thing of all these hast thou known of or found 



              canst thou say in thine heart

                thou hast seen with thine eyes

              with what cunning of art

                thou wast wrought in what wise 

    by what force of what stuff thou wast shapen  and shown on my breast to the skies 



              who hath given  who hath sold it thee 

                knowledge of me 

              has the wilderness told it thee 

                hast thou learnt of the sea 

    hast thou communed in spirit with night  have the winds taken counsel with thee 



              have i set such a star

                to show light on thy brow

              that thou sawest from afar

                what i show to thee now 

    have ye spoken as brethren together  the sun and the mountains and thou 



              what is here  dost thou know it 

                what was  hast thou known

              though her children forsake her 

                allured or afraid 

    praying prayers to the god of their fashion  she stirs not for all that have pray’d 



              a creed is a rod 

                and a crown is of night 

              but this thing is god 

                to be man with thy might 

    to grow straight in the strength of thy spirit  and live out thy life as the light 



              i am in thee to save thee 

                as my soul in thee saith 

              give thou as i gave thee 

                thy life blood and breath 

    green leaves of thy labour  white flowers of thy thought  and red fruit of thy death 



              be the ways of thy giving

                as mine were to thee 

              the free life of thy living 

                be the gift of it free 

    not as servant to lord  nor as master to slave  shalt thou give thee to me 



              o children of banishment 

                souls overcast 

              were the lights ye see vanish meant

                alway to last 

    ye would know not the sun overshining the shadows and stars overpast 



              i that saw where ye trod

                the dim paths of the night

              set the shadow call’d god

                in your skies to give light 

    but the morning of manhood is risen  and the shadowless soul is in sight 



              the tree many rooted

                that swells to the sky

              with frondage red fruited 

                the life tree am i 

    in the buds of your lives is the sap of my leaves  ye shall live and not die 



              but the gods of your fashion

                that take and that give 

              in their pity and passion

                that scourge and forgive 

    they are worms that are bred in the bark that falls off  they shall die and not live 



              my own blood is what stanches

                the wounds in my bark 

              stars caught in my branches

                make day of the dark 

    and are worshipp’d as suns till the sunrise shall tread out their fires as a spark 



              where dead ages hide under

                the live roots of the tree 

              in my darkness the thunder

                makes utterance of me 

    in the clash of my boughs with each other ye hear the waves sound of the sea 



              that noise is of time 

                as his feathers are spread

              and his feet set to climb

                through the boughs overhead 

    and my foliage rings round him and rustles  and branches are bent with his tread 



              the storm winds of ages

                blow through me and cease 

              the war wind that rages 

                the spring wind of peace 

    ere the breath of them roughen my tresses  ere one of my blossoms increase 



              all sounds of all changes 

                all shadows and lights

              on the world’s mountain ranges

                and stream riven heights 

    whose tongue is the wind’s tongue and language of storm clouds on earth shaking nights 



              all forms of all faces 

                all works of all hands

              in unsearchable places

                of time stricken lands 

    all death and all life  and all reigns and all ruins  drop through me as sands 



              though sore be my burden

                and more than ye know 

              and my growth have no guerdon

                but only to grow 

    yet i fail not of growing for lightnings above me or deathworms below 



              these too have their part in me 

                as i too in these 

              such fire is at heart in me 

                such sap is this tree’s 

    which hath in it all sounds and all secrets of infinite lands and of seas 



              in the spring colour’d hours

                when my mind was as may’s

              there brake forth of me flowers

                by centuries of days 

    strong blossoms with perfume of manhood  shot out from my spirit as rays 



              and the sound of them springing

                and smell of their shoots

              were as warmth and sweet singing

                and strength to my roots 

    and the lives of my children made perfect with freedom of soul were my fruits 



              i bid you but be 

                i have need not of prayer 

              i have need of you free

                as your mouths of mine air 

    that my heart may be greater within me  beholding the fruits of me fair 



              more fair than strange fruit is

                of faiths ye espouse 

              in me only the root is

                that blooms in your boughs 

    behold now your god that ye made you  to feed him with faith of your vows 



              in the darkening and whitening

                abysses adored 

              with dayspring and lightning

                for lamp and for sword 

    god thunders in heaven  and his angels are red with the wrath of the lord 



              o my sons  o too dutiful

                toward gods not of me 

              was not i enough beautiful 

                was it hard to be free 

    for behold  i am with you  am in you and of you  look forth now and see 



              lo  wing’d with world’s wonders 

                with miracles shod 

              with the fires of his thunders

                for raiment and rod 

    god trembles in heaven  and his angels are white with the terror of god 



              for his twilight is come on him 

                his anguish is here 

              and his spirits gaze dumb on him 

                grown gray from his fear 

    and his hour taketh hold on him stricken  the last of his infinite year 

              thought made him and breaks him 

                truth slays and forgives 

              but to you  as time takes him 

                this new thing it gives 

    even love  the belovèd republic  that feeds upon freedom and lives 



              for truth only is living 

                truth only is whole 

              and the love of his giving

                man’s polestar and pole 

    man  pulse of my centre  and fruit of my body  and seed of my soul 



              one birth of my bosom 

                one beam of mine eye 

              one topmost blossom

                that scales the sky 

    man  equal and one with me  man that is made of me  man that is i 





 810    ave atque vale 



 in memory of charles baudelaire 



    shall i strew on thee rose or rue or laurel 

        brother  on this that was the veil of thee 

        or quiet sea flower moulded by the sea 

    or simplest growth of meadow sweet or sorrel 

        such as the summer sleepy dryads weave 

        waked up by snow soft sudden rains at eve 

    or wilt thou rather  as on earth before 

        half faded fiery blossoms  pale with heat

        and full of bitter summer  but more sweet

    to thee than gleanings of a northern shore

        trod by no tropic feet 



    for always thee the fervid languid glories

        allured of heavier suns in mightier skies 

        thine ears knew all the wandering watery sighs

    where the sea sobs round lesbian promontories 

        the barren kiss of piteous wave to wave

        that knows not where is that leucadian grave

    which hides too deep the supreme head of song 

        ah  salt and sterile as her kisses were 

        the wild sea winds her and the green gulfs bear

    hither and thither  and vex and work her wrong 

        blind gods that cannot spare 



    thou sawest  in thine old singing season  brother 

        secrets and sorrows unbeheld of us 

        fierce loves  and lovely leaf buds poisonous 

    bare to thy subtler eye  but for none other

        blowing by night in some unbreathed in clime 

        the hidden harvest of luxurious time 

    sin without shape  and pleasure without speech 

        and where strange dreams in a tumultuous sleep

        make the shut eyes of stricken spirits weep 

    and with each face thou sawest the shadow on each 

        seeing as men sow men reap 



    o sleepless heart and sombre soul unsleeping 

        that were athirst for sleep and no more life

        and no more love  for peace and no more strife 

    now the dim gods of death have in their keeping

        spirit and body and all the springs of song 

        is it well now where love can do no wrong 

    where stingless pleasure has no foam or fang

        behind the unopening closure of her lips 

        is it not well where soul from body slips

    and flesh from bone divides without a pang

        as dew from flower bell drips 



    it is enough  the end and the beginning

        are one thing to thee  who art past the end 

        o hand unclasp’d of unbeholden friend 

    for thee no fruits to pluck  no palms for winning 

        no triumph and no labour and no lust 

        only dead yew leaves and a little dust 

    o quiet eyes wherein the light saith naught 

        whereto the day is dumb  nor any night

        with obscure finger silences your sight 

    nor in your speech the sudden soul speaks thought 

        sleep  and have sleep for light 



    now all strange hours and all strange loves are over 

        dreams and desires and sombre songs and sweet 

        hast thou found place at the great knees and feet

    of some pale titan woman like a lover 

        such as thy vision here solicited 

        under the shadow of her fair vast head 

    the deep division of prodigious breasts 

        the solemn slope of mighty limbs asleep 

        the weight of awful tresses that still keep

    the savour and shade of old world pine forests

        where the wet hill winds weep 



    hast thou found any likeness for thy vision 

        o gardener of strange flowers  what bud  what bloom 

        hast thou found sown  what gather’d in the gloom 

    what of despair  of rapture  of derision 

        what of life is there  what of ill or good 

        are the fruits gray like dust or bright like blood 

    does the dim ground grow any seed of ours 

        the faint fields quicken any terrene root 

        in low lands where the sun and moon are mute

    and all the stars keep silence  are there flowers

        at all  or any fruit 



    alas  but though my flying song flies after 

        o sweet strange elder singer  thy more fleet

        singing  and footprints of thy fleeter feet 

    some dim derision of mysterious laughter

        from the blind tongueless warders of the dead 

        some gainless glimpse of proserpine’s veil’d head 

    some little sound of unregarded tears

        wept by effaced unprofitable eyes 

        and from pale mouths some cadence of dead sighs  

    these only  these the hearkening spirit hears 

        sees only such things rise 



    thou art far too far for wings of words to follow 

        far too far off for thought or any prayer 

        what ails us with thee  who art wind and air 

    what ails us gazing where all seen is hollow 

        yet with some fancy  yet with some desire 

        dreams pursue death as winds a flying fire 

    our dreams pursue our dead and do not find 

        still  and more swift than they  the thin flame flies 

        the low light fails us in elusive skies 

    still the foil’d earnest ear is deaf  and blind

        are still the eluded eyes 





    not thee  o never thee  in all time’s changes 

        not thee  but this the sound of thy sad soul 

        the shadow of thy swift spirit  this shut scroll

    i lay my hand on  and not death estranges

        my spirit from communion of thy song  

        these memories and these melodies that throng

    veil’d porches of a muse funereal  

        these i salute  these touch  these clasp and fold

        as though a hand were in my hand to hold 

    or through mine ears a mourning musical

        of many mourners roll’d 



    i among these  i also  in such station

        as when the pyre was charr’d  and piled the sods 

        and offering to the dead made  and their gods 

    the old mourners had  standing to make libation 

        i stand  and to the gods and to the dead

        do reverence without prayer or praise  and shed

    offering to these unknown  the gods of gloom 

        and what of honey and spice my seed lands bear 

        and what i may of fruits in this chill’d air 

    and lay  orestes like  across the tomb

        a curl of sever’d hair 



    but by no hand nor any treason stricken 

        not like the low lying head of him  the king 

        the flame that made of troy a ruinous thing 

    thou liest and on this dust no tears could quicken 

        there fall no tears like theirs that all men hear

        fall tear by sweet imperishable tear

    down the opening leaves of holy poets’ pages 

        thee not orestes  not electra mourns 

        but bending us ward with memorial urns

    the most high muses that fulfil all ages

        weep  and our god’s heart yearns 



    for  sparing of his sacred strength  not often

        among us darkling here the lord of light

        makes manifest his music and his might

    in hearts that open and in lips that soften

        with the soft flame and heat of songs that shine 

        thy lips indeed he touch’d with bitter wine 

    and nourish’d them indeed with bitter bread 

        yet surely from his hand thy soul’s food came 

        the fire that scarr’d thy spirit at his flame

    was lighted  and thine hungering heart he fed

        who feeds our hearts with fame 



    therefore he too now at thy soul’s sunsetting 

        god of all suns and songs  he too bends down

        to mix his laurel with thy cypress crown 

    and save thy dust from blame and from forgetting 

        therefore he too  seeing all thou wert and art 

        compassionate  with sad and sacred heart 

    mourns thee of many his children the last dead 

        and hallows with strange tears and alien sighs

        thine unmelodious mouth and sunless eyes 

    and over thine irrevocable head

        sheds light from the under skies 



    and one weeps with him in the ways lethean 

        and stains with tears her changing bosom chill 

        that obscure venus of the hollow hill 

    that thing transformed which was the cytherean 

        with lips that lost their grecian laugh divine

        long since  and face no more call’d erycine  

    a ghost  a bitter and luxurious god 

        thee also with fair flesh and singing spell

        did she  a sad and second prey  compel

    into the footless places once more trod 

        and shadows hot from hell 



    and now no sacred staff shall break in blossom 

        no choral salutation lure to light

        a spirit sick with perfume and sweet night

    and love’s tired eyes and hands and barren bosom 

        there is no help for these things  none to mend 

        and none to mar  not all our songs  o friend 

    will make death clear or make life durable 

        howbeit with rose and ivy and wild vine

        and with wild notes about this dust of thine

    at least i fill the place where white dreams dwell

        and wreathe an unseen shrine 



    sleep  and if life was bitter to thee  pardon 

        if sweet  give thanks  thou hast no more to live 

        and to give thanks is good  and to forgive 

    out of the mystic and the mournful garden

        where all day through thine hands in barren braid

        wove the sick flowers of secrecy and shade 

    green buds of sorrow and sin  and remnants gray 

        sweet smelling  pale with poison  sanguine hearted 

        passions that sprang from sleep and thoughts that started 

    shall death not bring us all as thee one day

        among the days departed 



    for thee  o now a silent soul  my brother 

        take at my hands this garland  and farewell 

        thin is the leaf  and chill the wintry smell 

    and chill the solemn earth  a fatal mother 

        with sadder than the niobean womb 

        and in the hollow of her breasts a tomb 

    content thee  howsoe’er  whose days are done 

        there lies not any troublous thing before 

        nor sight nor sound to war against thee more 

    for whom all winds are quiet as the sun 

        all waters as the shore

    swallow  my sister  o sister swallow 

      how can thine heart be full of the spring 

        a thousand summers are over and dead 

    what hast thou found in the spring to follow 

      what hast thou found in thine heart to sing 

        what wilt thou do when the summer is shed 



    o swallow  sister  o fair swift swallow 

      why wilt thou fly after spring to the south 

        the soft south whither thine heart is set 

    shall not the grief of the old time follow 

      shall not the song thereof cleave to thy mouth 

        hast thou forgotten ere i forget 



    sister  my sister  o fleet sweet swallow 

      thy way is long to the sun and the south 

        but i  fulfill’d of my heart’s desire 

    shedding my song upon height  upon hollow 

      from tawny body and sweet small mouth

        feed the heart of the night with fire 



    i the nightingale all spring through 

      o swallow  sister  o changing swallow 

        all spring through till the spring be done 

    clothed with the light of the night on the dew 

      sing  while the hours and the wild birds follow 

        take flight and follow and find the sun 



    sister  my sister  o soft light swallow 

      though all things feast in the spring’s guest chamber 

        how hast thou heart to be glad thereof yet 

    for where thou fliest i shall not follow 

      till life forget and death remember 

        till thou remember and i forget 



    swallow  my sister  o singing swallow 

      i know not how thou hast heart to sing 

        hast thou the heart  is it all past over 

    thy lord the summer is good to follow 

      and fair the feet of thy lover the spring 

        but what wilt thou say to the spring thy lover 



    o swallow  sister  o fleeting swallow 

      my heart in me is a molten ember

        and over my head the waves have met 

    but thou wouldst tarry or i would follow

      could i forget or thou remember 

        couldst thou remember and i forget 



    o sweet stray sister  o shifting swallow 

      the heart’s division divideth us 

        thy heart is light as a leaf of a tree 

    but mine goes forth among sea gulfs hollow

      to the place of the slaying of itylus 

        the feast of daulis  the thracian sea 



    o swallow  sister  o rapid swallow 

      i pray thee sing not a little space 





        are not the roofs and the lintels wet 

    the woven web that was plain to follow 

      the small slain body  the flower like face 

        can i remember if thou forget 



    o sister  sister  thy first begotten 

      the hands that cling and the feet that follow 

        the voice of the child’s blood crying yet 

     who hath remember’d me  who hath forgotten  

      thou hast forgotten  o summer swallow 

        but the world shall end when i forget

 812    earliest spring 



    tossing his mane of snows in wildest eddies and tangles 

      lion like march cometh in  hoarse  with tempestuous breath 

    through all the moaning chimneys  and ’thwart all the hollows and angles

      round the shuddering house  threating of winter and death 



    but in my heart i feel the life of the wood and the meadow

      thrilling the pulses that own kindred with fibres that lift

    bud and blade to the sunward  within the inscrutable shadow 

      deep in the oak’s chill core  under the gathering drift 



    nay  to earth’s life in mine some prescience  or dream  or desire

       how shall i name it aright   comes for a moment and goes  

    rapture of life ineffable  perfect  as if in the brier 

      leafless there by my door  trembled a sense of the rose

    though its smoke shall hide the sun

            born for me

            all alone 

    with the power in his hands

            not o’erthrown

    by his godlike front and grace 

    i shall hold him for a space

            all my own

            so bold

    i walk’d to mallow town from aghadoe  aghadoe 

      brought his head from the gaol’s gate to aghadoe

      like an irish king he sleeps in aghadoe 





    o  to creep into that cairn in aghadoe  aghadoe

    o fly not  pleasure  pleasant hearted pleasure 

      fold me thy wings  i prithee  yet and stay 

        for my heart no measure

      to buy a garland for my love to day

      thou gray eyed mourner  fly not yet away

        thy sad weeds to morrow 

      to make a mourning for love’s yesterday 



    the voice of pity  time’s divine dear pity 

      moved me to tears  i dared not say them nay 

        but passed forth from the city 

        making thus my ditty

      of fair love lost for ever and a day 



 817    the desolate city 



    dark to me is the earth  dark to me are the heavens 

      where is she that i loved  the woman with eyes like stars 

    desolate are the streets  desolate is the city 

      a city taken by storm  where none are left but the slain 





    sadly i rose at dawn  undid the latch of my shutters 

      thinking to let in light  but i only let in love 

    birds in the boughs were awake  i listen’d to their chaunting 

      each one sang to his love  only i was alone 



    this  i said in my heart  is the hour of life and of pleasure 

      now each creature on earth has his joy  and lives in the sun 

    each in another’s eyes finds light  the light of compassion 

      this is the moment of pity  this is the moment of love 



    speak  o desolate city  speak  o silence in sadness 

      where is she that i loved in my strength  that spoke to my soul 

    where are those passionate eyes that appeal’d to my eyes in passion 

      where is the mouth that kiss’d me  the breast i laid to my own 



    speak  thou soul of my soul  for rage in my heart is kindled 

      tell me  where didst thou flee in the day of destruction and fear 

    see  my arms still enfold thee  enfolding thus all heaven 

      see  my desire is fulfill’d in thee  for it fills the earth 



    thus in my grief i lamented  then turn’d i from the window 

      turn’d to the stair  and the open door  and the empty street 

    crying aloud in my grief  for there was none to chide me 

      none to mock my weakness  none to behold my tears 



    groping i went  as blind  i sought her house  my belovèd’s 

      there i stopp’d at the silent door  and listen’d and tried the latch 

    love  i cried  dost thou slumber  this is no hour for slumber 

      this is the hour of love  and love i bring in my hand 





    i knew the house  with its windows barr’d  and its leafless fig tree 

      climbing round by the doorstep  the only one in the street 

    i knew where my hope had climb’d to its goal and there encircled

      all that those desolate walls once held  my belovèd’s heart 



    there in my grief she consoled me  she loved me when i loved not 

      she put her hand in my hand  and set her lips to my lips 

    she told me all her pain and show’d me all her trouble 

      i  like a fool  scarce heard  hardly return’d her kiss 



    love  thy eyes were like torches  they changed as i beheld them 

      love  thy lips were like gems  the seal thou settest on my life 

    love  if i loved not then  behold this hour thy vengeance 

      this is the fruit of thy love and thee  the unwise grown wise 



    weeping strangled my voice  i call’d out  but none answer’d 

      blindly the windows gazed back at me  dumbly the door 

    she whom i love  who loved me  look’d not on my yearning 

      gave me no more her hands to kiss  show’d me no more her soul 



    therefore the earth is dark to me  the sunlight blackness 

      therefore i go in tears and alone  by night and day 

    therefore i find no love in heaven  no light  no beauty 

      a heaven taken by storm  where none are left but the slain 





 818    with esther 



    he who has once been happy is for aye

      out of destruction’s reach  his fortune then

    holds nothing secret  and eternity 

      which is a mystery to other men 

    has like a woman given him its joy 

      time is his conquest  life  if it should fret 

    has paid him tribute  he can bear to die 

      he who has once been happy  when i set

    the world before me and survey its range 

      its mean ambitions  its scant fantasies 

    the shreds of pleasure which for lack of change

      men wrap around them and call happiness 

    the poor delights which are the tale and sum

      of the world’s courage in its martyrdom 



    when i hear laughter from a tavern door 

      when i see crowds agape and in the rain

    watching on tiptoe and with stifled roar

      to see a rocket fired or a bull slain 

    when misers handle gold  when orators

      touch strong men’s hearts with glory till they weep 

    when cities deck their streets for barren wars

      which have laid waste their youth  and when i keep

    calmly the count of my own life and see

      on what poor stuff my manhood’s dreams were fed

    till i too learn’d what dole of vanity

      will serve a human soul for daily bread 

      then i remember that i once was young

      and lived with esther the world’s gods among 





 819    to manon  on his fortune in loving her 



    i did not choose thee  dearest  it was love

    that made the choice  not i  mine eyes were blind

    as a rude shepherd’s who to some lone grove

    his offering brings and cares not at what shrine

    he bends his knee  the gifts alone were mine 

    the rest was love’s  he took me by the hand 

    and fired the sacrifice  and poured the wine 

    and spoke the words i might not understand 

      i was unwise in all but the dear chance

    which was my fortune  and the blind desire

    which led my foolish steps to love’s abode 

    and youth’s sublime unreason’d prescience

    which raised an altar and inscribed in fire

    its dedication  to the unknown god  





 820    st  valentines day 



    to day  all day  i rode upon the down 

    with hounds and horsemen  a brave company

    on this side in its glory lay the sea 

    on that the sussex weald  a sea of brown 

    the wind was light  and brightly the sun shone 

    and still we gallop’d on from gorse to gorse 

    and once  when check’d  a thrush sang  and my horse

    prick’d his quick ears as to a sound unknown 

      i knew the spring was come  i knew it even

    better than all by this  that through my chase

    in bush and stone and hill and sea and heaven

    i seem’d to see and follow still your face 

    your face my quarry was  for it i rode 

    my horse a thing of wings  myself a god

    seven weeks of sea  and twice seven days of storm

    upon the huge atlantic  and once more

    we ride into still water and the calm

    of a sweet evening  screen’d by either shore

    of spain and barbary  our toils are o’er 

    our exile is accomplish’d  once again

    we look on europe  mistress as of yore

    of the fair earth and of the hearts of men 

         ay  this is the famed rock which hercules

    and goth and moor bequeath’d us  at this door

    england stands sentry  god  to hear the shrill

    sweet treble of her fifes upon the breeze 

    and at the summons of the rock gun s roar

    to see her red coats marching from the hill 





 822    written at florence 



    o world  in very truth thou art too young 

    when wilt thou learn to wear the garb of age 

    world  with thy covering of yellow flowers 

    hast thou forgot what generations sprung

    out of thy loins and loved thee and are gone 

    hast thou no place in all their heritage

    where thou dost only weep  that i may come

    nor fear the mockery of thy yellow flowers 

      o world  in very truth thou art too young 

    the heroic wealth of passionate emprize

    built thee fair cities for thy naked plains 

    how hast thou set thy summer growth among

    the broken stones which were their palaces 

    hast thou forgot the darkness where  he  lies

    who made thee beautiful  or have thy bees

    found out his grave to build their honeycombs 



    o world  in very truth thou art too young 

    they gave thee love who measured out thy skies 

    and  when they found for thee another star 

    who made a festival and straightway hung

    the jewel on thy neck  o merry world 

    hast thou forgot the glory of those eyes

    which first look d love in thine  thou hast not furl d

    one banner of thy bridal car for them 

      o world  in very truth thou art too young 

    there was a voice which sang about thy spring 

    till winter froze the sweetness of his lips 

    and lo  the worms had hardly left his tongue

    before thy nightingales were come again 

    o world  what courage hast thou thus to sing 

    say  has thy merriment no secret pain 

    no sudden weariness that thou art young 





 823    the two highwaymen 



    i long have had a quarrel set with time

    because he robb’d me  every day of life

    was wrested from me after bitter strife 

    i never yet could see the sun go down

    but i was angry in my heart  nor hear

    the leaves fall in the wind without a tear

    over the dying summer  i have known

    no truce with time nor time’s accomplice  death 

      the fair world is the witness of a crime

    repeated every hour  for life and breath

    are sweet to all who live  and bitterly

    the voices of these robbers of the heath

    sound in each ear and chill the passer by 

      what have we done to thee  thou monstrous time 

    what have we done to death that we must die

    flaunts the flaring hollyhock 

    here  without a pang  one sees

    ranks  conditions  and degrees 



    all the seasons run their race

    in this quiet resting place 

    peach and apricot and fig

    here  in alleys cool and green 

    far ahead the thrush is seen 

    here along the southern wall

    keeps the bee his festival 

    all is quiet else mdash afar

    sounds of toil and turmoil are 



    here be shadows large and long 

    here be spaces meet for song 

    grant  o garden god  that i

 827    mooni 



      he that is by mooni now

    sees the water sapphires gleaming

    where the river spirit  dreaming 

    sleeps by fall and fountain streaming

      under lute of leaf and bough   

    hears what stamp of storm with stress is 

    psalms from unseen wildernesses

    deep amongst far hill recesses  

      he that is by mooni now 



      yea  for him by mooni’s marge

    sings the yellow hair’d september 

    with the face the gods remember 

    when the ridge is burnt to ember 

      and the dumb sea chains the barge 

    where the mount like molten brass is 

    down beneath fern feather’d passes

    noonday dew in cool green grasses

      gleams on him by mooni’s marge 



      who that dwells by mooni yet 

    feels in flowerful forest arches

    smiting wings and breath that parches

    where strong summer’s path of march is 

      and the suns in thunder set 

    housed beneath the gracious kirtle

    of the shadowy water myrtle  

    winds may kiss with heat and hurtle 

      he is safe by mooni yet 



      days there were when he who sings

     dumb so long through passion’s losses 

    stood where mooni’s water crosses

    shining tracks of green hair’d mosses 

      like a soul with radiant wings 

    then the psalm the wind rehearses  

    then the song the stream disperses  

    lent a beauty to his verses 

      who to night of mooni sings 



      ah  the theme  the sad  gray theme 

    certain days are not above me 

    certain hearts have ceased to love me 

    certain fancies fail to move me 

      like the effluent morning dream 

    head whereon the white is stealing 

    heart whose hurts are past all healing 

    where is now the first  pure feeling 

      ah  the theme  the sad  gray theme 



                                            



      still to be by mooni cool  

    where the water blossoms glister 

    and by gleaming vale and vista

    sits the english april’s sister 

      soft and sweet and wonderful 

    just to rest beneath the burning

    outer world  its sneers and spurning  

    ah  my heart  my heart is yearning

      still to be by mooni cool

 828    ode 



    we are the music makers 

      and we are the dreamers of dreams 

    wandering by lone sea breakers 

      and sitting by desolate streams 

    world losers and world forsakers 

      on whom the pale moon gleams 

    yet we are the movers and shakers

      of the world for ever  it seems 



    with wonderful deathless ditties

    we build up the world’s great cities 

      and out of a fabulous story

      we fashion an empire’s glory 

    one man with a dream  at pleasure 

      shall go forth and conquer a crown 

    and three with a new song’s measure

      can trample an empire down 



    we  in the ages lying

      in the buried past of the earth 

    built nineveh with our sighing 

      and babel itself with our mirth 

    and o’erthrew them with prophesying

      to the old of the new world’s worth 

    for each age is a dream that is dying 

      or one that is coming to birth 





 829    song 



    i made another garden  yea 

      for my new love 

    i left the dead rose where it lay

      and set the new above 

    why did my summer not begin 

      why did my heart not haste 

    my old love came and walk’d therein 

      and laid the garden waste 



    she enter’d with her weary smile 

      just as of old 

    she look’d around a little while

      and shiver’d with the cold 

    her passing touch was death to all 

      her passing look a blight 

    she made the white rose petals fall 

      and turn’d the red rose white 



    her pale robe clinging to the grass

      seem’d like a snake

    that bit the grass and ground  alas 

      and a sad trail did make 

    she went up slowly to the gate 

      and then  just as of yore 

    she turn’d back at the last to wait

      and say farewell once more 





 830    the fountain of tears 



    if you go over desert and mountain 

      far into the country of sorrow 

      to day and to night and to morrow 

    and maybe for months and for years 

      you shall come with a heart that is bursting

      for trouble and toiling and thirsting 

    you shall certainly come to the fountain

    at length   to the fountain of tears 



    very peaceful the place is  and solely

      for piteous lamenting and sighing 

      and those who come living or dying

    alike from their hopes and their fears 

      full of cypress like shadows the place is 

      and statues that cover their faces 

    but out of the gloom springs the holy

    and beautiful fountain of tears 



    and it flows and it flows with a motion

      so gentle and lovely and listless 

      and murmurs a tune so resistless

    to him who hath suffer’d and hears  

      you shall surely  without a word spoken 

      kneel down there and know your heart broken 

    and yield to the long curb’d emotion

    that day by the fountain of tears 



    for it grows and it grows  as though leaping

      up higher the more one is thinking 

      and ever its tunes go on sinking

    more poignantly into the ears 

      yea  so blessèd and good seems that fountain 

      reach’d after dry desert and mountain 

    you shall fall down at length in your weeping

    and bathe your sad face in the tears 



    then alas  while you lie there a season

      and sob between living and dying 

      and give up the land you were trying

    to find ’mid your hopes and your fears 

      o the world shall come up and pass o’er you 

      strong men shall not stay to care for you 

    nor wonder indeed for what reason

    your way should seem harder than theirs 



    but perhaps  while you lie  never lifting

      your cheek from the wet leaves it presses 

      nor caring to raise your wet tresses

    and look how the cold world appears  

      o perhaps the mere silences round you  

      all things in that place grief hath found you  

    yea  e’en to the clouds o’er you drifting 

    may soothe you somewhat through your tears 



    you may feel  when a falling leaf brushes

      your face  as though some one had kiss’d you 

      or think at least some one who miss’d you

    had sent you a thought   if that cheers 

      or a bird’s little song  faint and broken 

      may pass for a tender word spoken 

      enough  while around you there rushes

    that life drowning torrent of tears 



    and the tears shall flow faster and faster 

      brim over and baffle resistance 

      and roll down blear’d roads to each distance

    of past desolation and years 

      till they cover the place of each sorrow 

      and leave you no past and no morrow 

    for what man is able to master

    and stem the great fountain of tears 



    but the floods and the tears meet and gather 

      the sound of them all grows like thunder 

      o into what bosom  i wonder 

    is pour’d the whole sorrow of years 

      for eternity only seems keeping

      account of the great human weeping 

    may god  then  the maker and father  

    may he find a place for the tears

    the red rose whispers of passion 

      and the white rose breathes of love 

    o  the red rose is a falcon 

      and the white rose is a dove 



    but i send you a cream white rosebud

      with a flush on its petal tips 

    for the love that is purest and sweetest

      has a kiss of desire on the lips

 832    my delight and thy delight 



    my delight and thy delight

    walking  like two angels white 

    in the gardens of the night 



    my desire and thy desire

    twining to a tongue of fire 

    leaping live  and laughing higher 



    thro’ the everlasting strife

    in the mystery of life 



    love  from whom the world begun 

    hath the secret of the sun 



    love can tell  and love alone 

    whence the million stars were strewn 

    why each atom knows its own 

    how  in spite of woe and death 

    gay is life  and sweet is breath 



    this he taught us  this we knew 

    happy in his science true 

    hand in hand as we stood

    ’neath the shadows of the wood 

    heart to heart as we lay

    in the dawning of the day 





 833    spirits 



    angel spirits of sleep 

    white robed  with silver hair 

    in your meadows fair

    on the gliding stream

    writes her scatter’d dream 



    angel spirits of sleep 

    dancing to the weir

    in the hollow roar

    of its waters deep 

    know ye how men say

    that ye haunt no more

    isle and grassy shore

    with your moonlit play 

    that ye dance not here 

    white robed spirits of sleep 

    all the summer night

    threading dances light 





 834    nightingales 



      beautiful must be the mountains whence ye come 

      and bright in the fruitful valleys the streams  wherefrom

                ye learn your song 

    where are those starry woods  o might i wander there 

      among the flowers  which in that heavenly air

                bloom the year long 



      nay  barren are those mountains and spent the streams 

      our song is the voice of desire  that haunts our dreams 

                a throe of the heart 

    whose pining visions dim  forbidden hopes profound 

      no dying cadence nor long sigh can sound 

                for all our art 



      alone  aloud in the raptured ear of men

      we pour our dark nocturnal secret  and then 

                as night is withdrawn

    from these sweet springing meads and bursting boughs of may 

      dream  while the innumerable choir of day

                welcome the dawn 





 835    a passer by 



    whither  o splendid ship  thy white sails crowding 

      leaning across the bosom of the urgent west 

    that fearest nor sea rising  nor sky clouding 

      whither away  fair rover  and what thy quest 

      ah  soon  when winter has all our vales opprest 

    when skies are cold and misty  and hail is hurling 

      wilt thoù glìde on the blue pacific  or rest

    in a summer haven asleep  thy white sails furling 



    i there before thee  in the country that well thou knowest 

      already arrived am inhaling the odorous air 

    i watch thee enter unerringly where thou goest 

      and anchor queen of the strange shipping there 

      thy sails for awnings spread  thy masts bare 

    nor is aught from the foaming reef to the snow capp’d grandest

      peak  that is over the feathery palms  more fair

    than thou  so upright  so stately and still thou standest 





    and yet  o splendid ship  unhail’d and nameless 

      i know not if  aiming a fancy  i rightly divine

    that thou hast a purpose joyful  a courage blameless 

      thy port assured in a happier land than mine 

    but for all i have given thee  beauty enough is thine 

      as thou  aslant with trim tackle and shrouding 

    from the proud nostril curve of a prow’s line

      in the offing scatterest foam  thy white sails crowding 





 836    absence 



    when my love was away 

    full three days were not sped 

    i caught my fancy astray

    thinking if she were dead 



    and i alone  alone 

    it seem’d in my misery

    in all the world was none

    ever so lone as i 



    i wept  but it did not shame

    nor comfort my heart  away

    i rode as i might  and came

    to my love at close of day 



    the sight of her still’d my fears 

    my fairest hearted love 

    and yet in her eyes were tears 

    which when i questioned of 



    ‘o now thou art come ’ she cried 

    ‘’tis fled  but i thought to day

    i never could here abide 

    if thou wert longer away ’





 837    on a dead child 



    perfect little body  without fault or stain on thee 

      with promise of strength and manhood full and fair 

             though cold and stark and bare 

    the bloom and the charm of life doth awhile remain on thee 



    thy mother’s treasure wert thou   alas  no longer

      to visit her heart with wondrous joy  to be

             thy father’s pride   ah  he

    must gather his faith together  and his strength make stronger 



    to me  as i move thee now in the last duty 

      dost thou with a turn or gesture anon respond 

             startling my fancy fond

    with a chance attitude of the head  a freak of beauty 



    thy hand clasps  as ’twas wont  my finger  and holds it 

      but the grasp is the clasp of death  heartbreaking and stiff 

             yet feels to my hand as if

    ’twas still thy will  thy pleasure and trust that enfolds it 



    so i lay thee there  thy sunken eyelids closing   

      go lie thou there in thy coffin  thy last little bed   

             propping thy wise  sad head 

    thy firm  pale hands across thy chest disposing 



    so quiet  doth the change content thee   death  whither hath he taken thee 

      to a world  do i think  that rights the disaster of this 

             the vision of which i miss 

    who weep for the body  and wish but to warm thee and awaken thee 





    ah  little at best can all our hopes avail us

      to lift this sorrow  or cheer us  when in the dark 

             unwilling  alone we embark 

    and the things we have seen and have known and have heard of  fail us

      yet unsteel’d by scathing fire 

    lovely feet as yet unbruisèd

      on the ways of dark desire 

    sweetest hope that lookest smiling

    o’er the wilderness defiling 



    why such beauty  to be blighted

      by the swarm of foul destruction 

    why such innocence delighted 

      when sin stalks to thy seduction 

    all the litanies e’er chaunted

    shall not keep thy faith undaunted 



    i have pray’d the sainted morning

      to unclasp her hands to hold thee 

    from resignful eve’s adorning

      stol’n a robe of peace to enfold thee 

    with all charms of man’s contriving

    arm’d thee for thy lonely striving

      whence love’s timeless mockery took me   

    fashion’d so divine a creature 

      yea  and like a beast forsook me

    of her crime in thee  my treasure 





 839    winter nightfall 



    the day begins to droop   

      its course is done 

    but nothing tells the place

      of the setting sun 



    the hazy darkness deepens 

      and up the lane

    you may hear  but cannot see 

      the homing wain 



    an engine pants and hums

      in the farm hard by 

    its lowering smoke is lost

      in the lowering sky 



    the soaking branches drip 

      and all night through

    the dropping will not cease

      in the avenue 



    a tall man there in the house

      must keep his chair 

    he knows he will never again

      breathe the spring air 



    his heart is worn with work 

      he is giddy and sick

    if he rise to go as far

      as the nearest rick 



    he thinks of his morn of life 

      his hale  strong years 

    and braves as he may the night

      of darkness and tears 





 840    when death to either shall come 



    when death to either shall come   

      i pray it be first to me   

    be happy as ever at home 

      if so  as i wish  it be 



    possess thy heart  my own 

      and sing to the child on thy knee 

    or read to thyself alone

      the songs that i made for thee

    as one that for a weary space has lain

      lull’d by the song of circe and her wine

      in gardens near the pale of proserpine 

    where that ææan isle forgets the main 

    and only the low lutes of love complain 

      and only shadows of wan lovers pine  

      as such an one were glad to know the brine

    salt on his lips  and the large air again  

    so gladly from the songs of modern speech

      men turn  and see the stars  and feel the free

        shrill wind beyond the close of heavy flowers 

        and through the music of the languid hours

    they hear like ocean on a western beach

      the surge and thunder of the odyssey

    out of the night that covers me 

      black as the pit from pole to pole 

    i thank whatever gods may be

      for my unconquerable soul 



    in the fell clutch of circumstance

      i have not winced nor cried aloud 

    under the bludgeonings of chance

      my head is bloody  but unbow’d 



    beyond this place of wrath and tears

      looms but the horror of the shade 

    and yet the menace of the years

      finds and shall find me unafraid 



    it matters not how strait the gate 

      how charged with punishments the scroll 

    i am the master of my fate 

      i am the captain of my soul

    a late lark twitters from the quiet skies 

    and from the west 

    where the sun  his day’s work ended 

    lingers as in content 

    there falls on the old  gray city

    an influence luminous and serene 

    a shining peace 





    the smoke ascends

    in a rosy and golden haze  the spires

    shine and are changed  in the valley

    shadows rise  the lark sings on  the sun 

    closing his benediction 

    sinks  and the darkening air

    thrills with a sense of the triumphing night  

    night with her train of stars

    and her great gift of sleep 



    so be my passing 

    my task accomplish’d and the long day done 

    my wages taken  and in my heart

    let me be gather’d to the quiet west

          into the silver night

            she brought with her pale hand

          the topaz lanthorn light 

        and darted splendour o’er the land 

            around her in a band 

    ringstraked and pied  the great soft moths came flying 

      and flapping with their mad wings  fann’d

    the flickering flame  ascending  falling  dying 



          behind the thorny pink

            close wall of blossom’d may 

          i gazed thro’ one green chink

        and saw no more than thousands may   

            saw sweetness  tender and gay   

    saw full rose lips as rounded as the cherry 

      saw braided locks more dark than bay 

    and flashing eyes decorous  pure  and merry 





         with food for furry friends

           she pass’d  her lamp and she 

        till eaves and gable ends

      hid all that saffron sheen from me 

            around my rosy tree

    once more the silver starry night was shining 

      with depths of heaven  dewy and free 

    and crystals of a carven moon declining 



         alas  for him who dwells

           in frigid air of thought 

         when warmer light dispels

      the frozen calm his spirit sought 

          by life too lately taught

    he sees the ecstatic human from him stealing 

      reels from the joy experience brought 

    and dares not clutch what love was half revealing

    the boat is chafing at our long delay 

      and we must leave too soon

    the spicy sea pinks and the inborne spray 

      the tawny sands  the moon

 851    the last rose 



    ‘o which is the last rose ’

    a blossom of no name 

    at midnight the snow came 

    at daybreak a vast rose 

    in darkness unfurl’d 

    o’er petall’d the world 



    its odourless pallor

    blossom’d forlorn 

    till radiant valour

    established the morn  

    till the night

    was undone

    in her fight

    with the sun 



    the brave orb in state rose 

    and crimson he shone first 

    while from the high vine

    of heaven the dawn burst 

    staining the great rose

    from sky line to sky line 



    the red rose of morn

    a white rose at noon turn’d 

    but at sunset reborn

    all red again soon burn’d 

    then the pale rose of noonday

    rebloom’d in the night 

    and spectrally white

      in the light

    of the moon lay 



    but the vast rose

      was scentless 

    and this is the reason 

    when the blast rose

      relentless 

    and brought in due season

    the snow rose  the last rose

    congeal’d in its breath 

    then came with it treason 

    the traitor was death 



    in lee valleys crowded 

    the sheep and the birds

    were frozen and shrouded

    in flights and in herds 

    in highways

    and byways

    the young and the old

    were tortured and madden’d

    and kill’d by the cold 

    but many were gladden’d

    by the beautiful last rose 

    the blossom of no name

    that came when the snow came 

    in darkness unfurl’d  

    the wonderful vast rose

    that fill’d all the world

    let me go forth  and share

      the overflowing sun

      with one wise friend  or one

    better than wise  being fair 

    where the pewit wheels and dips

      on heights of bracken and ling 

    and earth  unto her leaflet tips 

      tingles with the spring 



    what is so sweet and dear

      as a prosperous morn in may 

      the confident prime of the day 

    and the dauntless youth of the year 

    when nothing that asks for bliss 

      asking aright  is denied 

    and half of the world a bridegroom is 

      and half of the world a bride 



    the song of mingling flows 

      grave  ceremonial  pure 

      as once  from lips that endure 

    the cosmic descant rose 

    when the temporal lord of life 

      going his golden way 

    had taken a wondrous maid to wife

      that long had said him nay 



    for of old the sun  our sire 

      came wooing the mother of men 

      earth  that was virginal then 

    vestal fire to his fire 

    silent her bosom and coy 

      but the strong god sued and press’d 

    and born of their starry nuptial joy

      are all that drink of her breast 



    and the triumph of him that begot 

      and the travail of her that bore 

      behold they are evermore

    as warp and weft in our lot 

    we are children of splendour and flame 

      of shuddering  also  and tears 

    magnificent out of the dust we came 

      and abject from the spheres 



    o bright irresistible lord 

      we are fruit of earth’s womb  each one 

      and fruit of thy loins  o sun 

    whence first was the seed outpour’d 

    to thee as our father we bow 

      forbidden thy father to see 

    who is older and greater than thou  as thou

      art greater and older than we 



    thou art but as a word of his speech 

      thou art but as a wave of his hand 

      thou art brief as a glitter of sand

    ’twixt tide and tide on his beach 

    thou art less than a spark of his fire 

      or a moment’s mood of his soul 

    thou art lost in the notes on the lips of his choir

      that chant the chant of the whole 





 854    the great misgiving 



    ‘not ours ’ say some  ‘the thought of death to dread 

      asking no heaven  we fear no fabled hell 

    life is a feast  and we have banqueted  

      shall not the worms as well 





    ‘the after silence  when the feast is o’er 

      and void the places where the minstrels stood 

    differs in nought from what hath been before 

      and is nor ill nor good ’



    ah  but the apparition  the dumb sign  

      the beckoning finger bidding me forgo

    the fellowship  the converse  and the wine 

      the songs  the festal glow 



    and ah  to know not  while with friends i sit 

      and while the purple joy is pass’d about 

    whether ’tis ampler day divinelier lit

      or homeless night without 



    and whether  stepping forth  my soul shall see

      new prospects  or fall sheer  a blinded thing 

     there  is  o grave  thy hourly victory 

      and there  o death  thy sting

    for a golden moment share

 858    my grief on the sea 



from the irish



    my grief on the sea 

      how the waves of it roll 

    for they heave between me

      and the love of my soul 



    abandon’d  forsaken 

      to grief and to care 

    will the sea ever waken

      relief from despair 



    my grief and my trouble 

      would he and i were 

    in the province of leinster 

      or county of clare 





    were i and my darling  

      o heart bitter wound   

    on board of the ship

      for america bound 



    on a green bed of rushes

      all last night i lay 

    and i flung it abroad

      with the heat of the day 



    and my love came behind me 

      he came from the south 

    his breast to my bosom 

      his mouth to my mouth

 859    the phœnix 



    by feathers green  across casbeen

      the pilgrims track the phœnix flown 

    by gems he strew’d in waste and wood 

      and jewell’d plumes at random thrown 



    till wandering far  by moon and star 

      they stand beside the fruitful pyre 

    where breaking bright with sanguine light

      the impulsive bird forgets his sire 



    those ashes shine like ruby wine 

      like bag of tyrian murex spilt 

    the claw  the jowl of the flying fowl

      are with the glorious anguish gilt 





    so rare the light  so rich the sight 

      those pilgrim men  on profit bent 

    drop hands and eyes and merchandise 

      and are with gazing most content

 860    he fell among thieves 



    ‘ye have robb’d ’ said he  ‘ye have slaughtered and made an end 

      take your ill got plunder  and bury the dead 

    what will ye more of your guest and sometime friend ’

      ‘blood for our blood ’ they said 



    he laugh’d  ‘if one may settle the score for five 

      i am ready  but let the reckoning stand till day 

    i have loved the sunlight as dearly as any alive ’

      ‘you shall die at dawn ’ said they 



    he flung his empty revolver down the slope 

      he climb’d alone to the eastward edge of the trees 

    all night long in a dream untroubled of hope

      he brooded  clasping his knees 



    he did not hear the monotonous roar that fills

      the ravine where the yassîn river sullenly flows 

    he did not see the starlight on the laspur hills 

      or the far afghan snows 



    he saw the april noon on his books aglow 

      the wistaria trailing in at the window wide 

    he heard his father’s voice from the terrace below

      calling him down to ride 





    he saw the gray little church across the park 

      the mounds that hid the loved and honour’d dead 

    the norman arch  the chancel softly dark 

      the brasses black and red 



    he saw the school close  sunny and green 

      the runner beside him  the stand by the parapet wall 

    the distant tape  and the crowd roaring between 

      his own name over all 



    he saw the dark wainscot and timber’d roof 

      the long tables  and the faces merry and keen 

    the college eight and their trainer dining aloof 

      the dons on the daïs serene 



    he watch’d the liner’s stem ploughing the foam 

      he felt her trembling speed and the thrash of her screw 

    he heard the passengers’ voices talking of home 

      he saw the flag she flew 



    and now it was dawn  he rose strong on his feet 

      and strode to his ruin’d camp below the wood 

    he drank the breath of the morning cool and sweet 

      his murderers round him stood 



    light on the laspur hills was broadening fast 

      the blood red snow peaks chill’d to a dazzling white 

    he turn’d  and saw the golden circle at last 

      cut by the eastern height 



    ‘o glorious life  who dwellest in earth and sun 

      i have lived  i praise and adore thee ’ a sword swept 

    over the pass the voices one by one

      faded  and the hill slept

 861    reunited 



    when you and i have play’d the little hour 

      have seen the tall subaltern life to death

      yield up his sword  and  smiling  draw the breath 

    the first long breath of freedom  when the flower

    of recompense hath flutter’d to our feet 

      as to an actor’s  and  the curtain down 

      we turn to face each other all alone  

    alone  we two  who never yet did meet 

    alone  and absolute  and free  o then 

      o then  most dear  how shall be told the tale 

    clasp’d hands  press’d lips  and so clasp’d hands again 

      no words  but as the proud wind fills the sail 

        my love to yours shall reach  then one deep moan

        of joy  and then our infinite alone

 862    where my books go 





    all the words that i utter 

      and all the words that i write 

    must spread out their wings untiring 

      and never rest in their flight 

    till they come where your sad  sad heart is 

      and sing to you in the night 

    beyond where the waters are moving 

      storm darken’d or starry bright 





 863    when you are old 



    when you are old and gray and full of sleep

      and nodding by the fire  take down this book 

      and slowly read  and dream of the soft look

    your eyes had once  and of their shadows deep 



    how many loved your moments of glad grace 

      and loved your beauty with love false or true 

      but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you 

    and loved the sorrows of your changing face 



    and bending down beside the glowing bars 

      murmur  a little sadly  how love fled

      and paced upon the mountains overhead 

    and hid his face amid a crowd of stars 





 864    the lake isle of innisfree 



    i will arise and go now  and go to innisfree 

    and a small cabin build there  of clay and wattles made 

    nine bean rows will i have there  a hive for the honey bee 

      and live alone in the bee loud glade 



    and i shall have some peace there  for peace comes dropping slow 

    dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings 

    there midnight’s all a glimmer  and noon a purple glow 

      and evening full of the linnet’s wings 



    i will arise and go now  for always night and day

    i hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore 

    while i stand on the roadway  or on the pavements gray 

      i hear it in the deep heart’s core

 865    a dedication 



    my new cut ashlar takes the light

      where crimson blank the windows flare 

    by my own work  before the night 

      great overseer  i make my prayer 



    if there be good in that i wrought 

      thy hand compell’d it  master  thine 

    where i have fail’d to meet thy thought

      i know  through thee  the blame is mine 



    one instant’s toil to thee denied

      stands all eternity’s offence 

    of that i did with thee to guide

      to thee  through thee  be excellence 



    who  lest all thought of eden fade 

      bring’st eden to the craftsman’s brain 

    godlike to muse o’er his own trade

      and manlike stand with god again 



    the depth and dream of my desire 

      the bitter paths wherein i stray 

    thou knowest who hast made the fire 

      thou knowest who hast made the clay 



    one stone the more swings to her place

      in that dread temple of thy worth  

    it is enough that through thy grace

      i saw naught common on thy earth 





    take not that vision from my ken 

      o  whatsoe’er may spoil or speed 

    help me to need no aid from men 

      that i may help such men as need 





 866    l’envoi 



    there’s a whisper down the field where the year has shot her yield

      and the ricks stand gray to the sun 

    singing   ‘over then  come over  for the bee has quit the clover

      and your english summer’s done ’

        you have heard the beat of the off shore wind

        and the thresh of the deep sea rain 

        you have heard the song  how long  how long 

        pull out on the trail again 



    ha’ done with the tents of shem  dear lass 

    we’ve seen the seasons through 

    and it’s time to turn on the old trail  our own trail  the out trail 

    pull out  pull out  on the long trail  the trail that is always new 



    it’s north you may run to the rime ring’d sun 

      or south to the blind horn’s hate 

    or east all the way into mississippi bay 

      or west to the golden gate 

    where the blindest bluffs hold good  dear lass 

    and the wildest tales are true 

    and the men bulk big on the old trail  our own trail  the out trail 

    and life runs large on the long trail  the trail that is always new 





    the days are sick and cold  and the skies are gray and old 

      and the twice breathed airs blow damp 

    and i’d sell my tired soul for the bucking beam sea roll

      of a black bilbao tramp 

    with her load line over her hatch  dear lass 

    and a drunken dago crew 

    and her nose held down on the old trail  our own trail  the out trail 

    from cadiz bar on the long trail  the trail that is always new 



    there be triple ways to take  of the eagle or the snake 

      or the way of a man with a maid 

    but the sweetest way to me is a ship’s upon the sea

      in the heel of the north east trade 

    can you hear the crash on her bows  dear lass 

    and the drum of the racing screw 

    as she ships it green on the old trail  our own trail  the out trail 

    as she lifts and ’scends on the long trail  the trail that is always new 



    see the shaking funnels roar  with the peter at the fore 

      and the fenders grind and heave 

    and the derricks clack and grate  as the tackle hooks the crate 

      and the fall rope whines through the sheave 

    it’s ‘gang plank up and in ’ dear lass 

    it’s ‘hawsers warp her through ’

    and it’s ‘all clear aft’ on the old trail  our own trail  the out trail 

    we’re backing down on the long trail  the trail that is always new 





    o the mutter overside  when the port fog holds us tied 

      and the sirens hoot their dread 

    when foot by foot we creep o’er the hueless viewless deep

      to the sob of the questing lead 

    it’s down by the lower hope  dear lass 

    with the gunfleet sands in view 

    till the mouse swings green on the old trail  our own trail  the out trail 

    and the gull light lifts on the long trail  the trail that is always new 



    o the blazing tropic night  when the wake’s a welt of light

      that holds the hot sky tame 

    and the steady fore foot snores through the planet powder’d floors

      where the scared whale flukes in flame 

    her plates are scarr’d by the sun  dear lass 

    and her ropes are taut with the dew 

    for we’re booming down on the old trail  our own trail  the out trail 

    we’re sagging south on the long trail  the trail that is always new 



    then home  get her home  where the drunken rollers comb 

      and the shouting seas drive by 

    and the engines stamp and ring  and the wet bows reel and swing 

      and the southern cross rides high 

    yes  the old lost stars wheel back  dear lass 

    that blaze in the velvet blue 

    they’re all old friends on the old trail  our own trail  the out trail 

    they’re god’s own guides on the long trail  the trail that is always new 





    fly forward  o my heart  from the foreland to the start  

      we’re steaming all too slow 

    and it’s twenty thousand mile to our little lazy isle

      where the trumpet orchids blow 

    you have heard the call of the off shore wind

    and the voice of the deep sea rain 

    you have heard the song  how long  how long 

      pull out on the trail again 



    the lord knows what we may find  dear lass 

    and the deuce knows what we may do  

    but we’re back once more on the old trail  our own trail  the out trail 

    we’re down  hull down on the long trail  the trail that is always new

    lest we forget  lest we forget 



    if  drunk with sight of power  we loose

      wild tongues that have not thee in awe  

    such boasting as the gentiles use

      or lesser breeds without the law  

    lord god of hosts  be with us yet 

    lest we forget  lest we forget 



    for heathen heart that puts her trust

      in reeking tube and iron shard  

    all valiant dust that builds on dust 

      and guarding calls not thee to guard  

    for frantic boast and foolish word 

    thy mercy on thy people  lord

    she’s somewhere in the sunlight strong 

      her tears are in the falling rain 

    she calls me in the wind’s soft song 

      and with the flowers she comes again 



    yon bird is but her messenger 

      the moon is but her silver car 

    yea  sun and moon are sent by her 

      and every wistful waiting star 





 869    the second crucifixion 



    loud mockers in the roaring street

      say christ is crucified again 

    twice pierced his gospel bearing feet 

      twice broken his great heart in vain 



    i hear  and to myself i smile 

    for christ talks with me all the while 



    no angel now to roll the stone

      from off his unawaking sleep 

    in vain shall mary watch alone 

      in vain the soldiers vigil keep 



    yet while they deem my lord is dead

    my eyes are on his shining head 



    ah  never more shall mary hear

      that voice exceeding sweet and low

    within the garden calling clear 

      her lord is gone  and she must go 



    yet all the while my lord i meet

    in every london lane and street 



    poor lazarus shall wait in vain 

      and bartimæus still go blind 

    the healing hem shall ne’er again

      be touch’d by suffering humankind 



    yet all the while i see them rest 

    the poor and outcast  on his breast 





    no more unto the stubborn heart

      with gentle knocking shall he plead 

    no more the mystic pity start 

      for christ twice dead is dead indeed 



    so in the street i hear men say 

    yet christ is with me all the day

      joyous  o youth  in the agèd world renew

    o world  be nobler  for her sake

    what wrongs are borne  what deeds are done

    in thee  beneath thy daily sun 

      know’st thou not that her tender heart

    for pain and very shame would break

 872    by the margin of the great deep 



    when the breath of twilight blows to flame the misty skies 

    all its vaporous sapphire  violet glow and silver gleam 

    with their magic flood me through the gateway of the eyes 

        i am one with the twilight’s dream 



    when the trees and skies and fields are one in dusky mood 

    every heart of man is rapt within the mother’s breast 

    full of peace and sleep and dreams in the vasty quietude 

        i am one with their hearts at rest 



    from our immemorial joys of hearth and home and love

    stray’d away along the margin of the unknown tide 

    all its reach of soundless calm can thrill me far above

        word or touch from the lips beside 



    aye  and deep and deep and deeper let me drink and draw

    from the olden fountain more than light or peace or dream 

    such primæval being as o’erfills the heart with awe 

        growing one with its silent stream 





 873    the great breath 



    its edges foam’d with amethyst and rose 

    withers once more the old blue flower of day 

    there where the ether like a diamond glows 

            its petals fade away 



    a shadowy tumult stirs the dusky air 

    sparkle the delicate dews  the distant snows 

    the great deep thrills  for through it everywhere

            the breath of beauty blows 





    i saw how all the trembling ages past 

    moulded to her by deep and deeper breath 

    near’d to the hour when beauty breathes her last

            and knows herself in death

 875    the poppy 



    summer set lip to earth’s bosom bare 

    and left the flush’d print in a poppy there 

    like a yawn of fire from the grass it came 

    and the fanning wind puff’d it to flapping flame 



    with burnt mouth red like a lion’s it drank

    the blood of the sun as he slaughter’d sank 

    and dipp’d its cup in the purpurate shine

    when the eastern conduits ran with wine 



    till it grew lethargied with fierce bliss 

    and hot as a swinkèd gipsy is 

    and drowsed in sleepy savageries 

    with mouth wide a pout for a sultry kiss 



    a child and man paced side by side 

    treading the skirts of eventide 

    but between the clasp of his hand and hers

    lay  felt not  twenty wither’d years 



    she turn’d  with the rout of her dusk south hair 

    and saw the sleeping gipsy there 

    and snatch’d and snapp’d it in swift child’s whim 

    with  ‘keep it  long as you live ’  to him 



    and his smile  as nymphs from their laving meres 

    trembled up from a bath of tears 

    and joy  like a mew sea rock’d apart 

    toss’d on the wave of his troubled heart 





    for  he  saw what she did not see 

    that  as kindled by its own fervency  

    the verge shrivell’d inward smoulderingly 



    and suddenly ’twixt his hand and hers

    he knew the twenty withered years  

    no flower  but twenty shrivelled years 



    ‘was never such thing until this hour ’

    low to his heart he said  ‘the flower

    of sleep brings wakening to me 

    and of oblivion memory ’



    ‘was never this thing to me ’ he said 

    ‘though with bruisèd poppies my feet are red ’

    and again to his own heart very low 

    ‘o child  i love  for i love and know 



    ‘but you  who love nor know at all

    the diverse chambers in love’s guest hall 

    where some rise early  few sit long 

    in how differing accents hear the throng

    his great pentecostal tongue 



    ‘who know not love from amity 

    nor my reported self from me 

    a fair fit gift is this  meseems 

    you give  this withering flower of dreams 



    ‘o frankly fickle  and fickly true 

    do you know what the days will do to you 

    to your love and you what the days will do 

    o frankly fickle  and fickly true 





    ‘you have loved me  fair  three lives  or days 

    ’twill pass with the passing of my face 

    but where  i  go  your face goes too 

    to watch lest i play false to you 



    ‘i am but  my sweet  your foster lover 

    knowing well when certain years are over

    you vanish from me to another 

    yet i know  and love  like the foster mother 



    ‘so  frankly fickle  and fickly true 

    for my brief life while i take from you

    this token  fair and fit  meseems 

    for me  this withering flower of dreams ’



                                            



    the sleep flower sways in the wheat its head 

    heavy with dreams  as that with bread 

    the goodly grain and the sun flush’d sleeper

    the reaper reaps  and time the reaper 



    i hang ’mid men my needless head 

    and my fruit is dreams  as theirs is bread 

    the goodly men and the sun hazed sleeper

    time shall reap  but after the reaper

    the world shall glean of me  me the sleeper 



    love  love  your flower of wither’d dream

    in leavèd rhyme lies safe  i deem 

    shelter’d and shut in a nook of rhyme 

    from the reaper man  and his reaper time 



    love   i  fall into the claws of time 

    but lasts within a leavèd rhyme

    all that the world of me esteems  

    my wither’d dreams  my wither’d dreams

    the peace of night  or love’s divine surprise 

    high heart  high speech  high deeds ’mid honouring eyes 

    for at thy word

    all these are taken away 



    not unto us  o lord 

    to us thou givest the scorn  the scourge  the scar 

    the ache of life  the loneliness of death 

    the insufferable sufficiency of breath 

    and with thy sword

    thou piercest very far 



    not unto us  o lord 

    nay  lord  but unto her be all things given  

    my light and life and earth and sky be blasted  

    but let not all that wealth of loss be wasted 

    let hell afford

    the pavement of her heaven

 877    sheep and lambs 



    all in the april morning 

         april airs were abroad 

    the sheep with their little lambs

         pass’d me by on the road 





    the sheep with their little lambs

      pass’d me by on the road 

    all in an april evening

      i thought on the lamb of god 



    the lambs were weary  and crying

      with a weak human cry 

    i thought on the lamb of god

      going meekly to die 



    up in the blue  blue mountains

      dewy pastures are sweet 

    rest for the little bodies 

      rest for the little feet 



    rest for the lamb of god

      up on the hill top green 

    only a cross of shame

      two stark crosses between 



    all in the april evening 

      april airs were abroad 

    i saw the sheep with their lambs 

      and thought on the lamb of god

 878    an upper chamber 



    i came into the city and none knew me 

      none came forth  none shouted ‘he is here 

    not a hand with laurel would bestrew me 

      all the way by which i drew anear  

      night my banner  and my herald fear 





    but i knew where one so long had waited

      in the low room at the stairway’s height 

    trembling lest my foot should be belated 

      singing  sighing for the long hours’ flight

      towards the moment of our dear delight 



    i came into the city when you hail’d me

      saviour  and again your chosen lord   

    not one guessing what it was that fail’d me 

      while along the way as they adored

      thousands  thousands  shouted in accord 



    but through all the joy i knew  i only  

      how the hostel of my heart lay bare and cold 

    silent of its music  and how lonely 

      never  though you crown me with your gold 

      shall i find that little chamber as of old

 879    renouncement 



    i must not think of thee  and  tired yet strong 

      i shun the love that lurks in all delight  

      the love of thee  and in the blue heaven’s height 

    and in the dearest passage of a song 

    oh  just beyond the sweetest thoughts that throng

      this breast  the thought of thee waits hidden yet bright 

      but it must never  never come in sight 

    i must stop short of thee the whole day long 

    but when sleep comes to close each difficult day 

      when night gives pause to the long watch i keep 

    and all my bonds i needs must loose apart 

    must doff my will as raiment laid away   

      with the first dream that comes with the first sleep

    i run  i run  i am gather’d to thy heart 





 880    the lady of the lambs 



    she walks  the lady of my delight  

      a shepherdess of sheep 

    her flocks are thoughts  she keeps them white 

      she guards them from the steep 

    she feeds them on the fragrant height

      and folds them in for sleep 



    she roams maternal hills and bright 

      dark valleys safe and deep 

    her dreams are innocent at night 

      the chastest stars may peep 

    she walks  the lady of my delight  

      a shepherdess of sheep 



    she holds her little thoughts in sight 

      though gay they run and leap 

    she is so circumspect and right 

      she has her soul to keep 

    she walks  the lady of my delight  

      a shepherdess of sheep

    ’twas the dream of a god 

      and the mould of his hand 

    that you shook ’neath his stroke 

    that you trembled and broke

      to this beautiful land 



    here he loosed from his hold

      a brown tumult of wings 

    till the wind on the sea

    bore the strange melody

      of an island that sings 



    he made you all fair 

      you in purple and gold 

    you in silver and green 

    till no eye that has seen

      without love can behold 



    i have left you behind

      in the path of the past 

    with the white breath of flowers 

    with the best of god’s hours 

      i have left you at last

 882    genius loci 



    peace  shepherd  peace  what boots it singing on 

      since long ago grace giving phœbus died 

      and all the train that loved the stream bright side

    of the poetic mount with him are gone

    beyond the shores of styx and acheron 

      in unexplorèd realms of night to hide 

      the clouds that strew their shadows far and wide

    are all of heaven that visits helicon 

    yet here  where never muse or god did haunt 

      still may some nameless power of nature stray 

    pleased with the reedy stream’s continual chant

      and purple pomp of these broad fields in may 

    the shepherds meet him where he herds the kine 

    and careless pass him by whose is the gift divine

 883    dominus illuminatio mea 



    in the hour of death  after this life’s whim 

    when the heart beats low  and the eyes grow dim 

    and pain has exhausted every limb  

      the lover of the lord shall trust in him 



    when the will has forgotten the lifelong aim 

    and the mind can only disgrace its fame 

    and a man is uncertain of his own name  

      the power of the lord shall fill this frame 



    when the last sigh is heaved  and the last tear shed 

    and the coffin is waiting beside the bed 

    and the widow and child forsake the dead  

      the angel of the lord shall lift this head 



    for even the purest delight may pall 

    and power must fail  and the pride must fall 

    and the love of the dearest friends grow small  

      but the glory of the lord is all in all
