introductory note





 never perhaps   says miss pardoe  in the preface to the  court and

reign of francis i      did the reign of any european sovereign present

so many and such varying phases  a contest for empire  a captive

monarch  a female regency  and a religious war  the poisoned bowl and

the burning pile alike doing their work of death amid scenes of

uncalculating splendor and unbridled dissipation  the atrocities of

bigotry and intolerance  blent with the most unblushing licentiousness

and the most undisguised profligacy   such are the materials offered to

the student by the times of francis i  



the period thus characterized is that in which the scene of the present

romance is laid  and although the plot is mainly concerned with the

fortunes of others than subjects of the  roi chevalier   we are treated

to a succession of vivid pictures of life and manners at the french

court and in the french capital 



the author depicts the king rather as he appeared to the world before

what has been called the  legend of the roi chevalier    that is to say 

the long prevailing idea that françois i  was the most chivalrous

monarch who ever sat upon a european throne   had been modified by the

independent researches of those who have not feared to go behind the

writings of the old and well tutored chroniclers whose works have formed

the basis of most modern histories   chroniclers who seem to have been

guided by cardinal richelieu s famous remark to an aspiring historian 

apropos of certain animadversions upon the character of louis xi   that

 it is treason to discuss the actions of a king who has been dead only

two centuries  



the result of these researches is thus summed up by miss pardoe in the

same preface   



 the glorious day of marignano saw the rising  and that of pavia the

setting  of his fame as a soldier  so true it is that the prowess of the

man was shamed by that of the boy  the early and unregretted death of

one of his neglected queens  and the heart broken endurance of the

other  contrasted with the unbounded influence of his first favorite and

the insolent arrogance of his second  will sufficiently demonstrate his

character as a husband  his open and illegal oppression of an overtaxed

and suffering people to satisfy the cravings of an extortionate and

licentious court  will suffice to disclose his value as a monarch  while

the reckless indifference with which he falsified his political pledges 

abandoned his allies in their extremity in order to further his own

interests  and sacrificed the welfare of his kingdom and the safety of

his armies to his own puerile vanity  will complete a picture by no

means calculated to elicit one regret that his reign was not prolonged  



victor hugo dared to puncture the  legend   when  in the play of  le roi

s amuse   he represented the  knightly king  as being enticed to a low

water side hovel by the charms of a girl of the street  but even the

government of the citizen king  louis philippe  could not brook such an

attack upon the  divinity that doth hedge a king   and  after the first

performance in 1832  the strong hand of the censorship was laid upon the

play  and fifty years elapsed before it again saw the light upon the

stage 



the first titular favorite of king françois  the comtesse de

châteaubriand  whose character was in every respect diametrically

opposed to that of her successor  was an object of dislike and dread to

louise de savoie  the king s mother  because of her unbounded influence

over françois  when he returned to france  after his captivity in spain

following upon his defeat at pavia  his passion for madame de

châteaubriand was found to have increased rather than diminished  in

looking about for some means to kill this passion  and in that way put

an end to the influence of the favorite  louise de savoie was not

obliged to go beyond the lovely and licentious circle of her own maids

of honor  she found in anne de pisseleu  mademoiselle d heilly  that

combination of loveliness  youth  frailty  and forwardness which she

required for her purpose  and so arranged her first presentation to the

king that the desired effect was produced almost immediately  it was not

long before a suitably complaisant husband was found for the new

divinity  in the person of the duc d etampes  and she had soon entirely

supplanted madame de châteaubriand  driven her from court  and entered

upon a period of queenly power and magnificence  which was to endure

with little change or diminution for full twenty years  and until the

death of her royal lover and slave in 1547 



 his excessive passion for the artful favorite blinded him to her

vices   says miss pardoe   already had she taught him that her love was

to be retained only by an entire devotion  and even while he suffered

her to become the arbiter of his own actions  she betrayed him with a

recklessness as bold as it was degrading  nothing  moreover  could

satisfy her rapacity  and while distress  which amounted almost to

famine  oppressed the lower classes of the citizens  she greedily seized

upon every opportunity of enriching herself and aggrandizing her

family   1 



the following passage from the same interesting and painstaking work  if

compared with the episode in  ascanio  of madame d etampes s designs

upon colombe  will serve to illustrate the extreme fidelity to

historical truth  even in what may seem to be minor matters  which so

amply justifies the title of  historical romances  as applied to this

and many other of dumas s works   



 we pass over  for obvious reasons  the minor influences  each perhaps

insignificant in itself  but in the aggregate fearfully mischievous 

which were exercised by the fair and frail maids of honor  each  or

nearly each  being in her turn the  cynthia of the minute   and more

than one of whom owed her temporary favor to the duchesse d etampes

herself  whose secret intrigues and undisguised ambition absorbed more

of her time than could have been left at her disposal  had she not

provided the inconstant but exacting monarch with some new object of

interest  and the tact with which she selected these facile beauties was

not one of the least of her talents  never  upon any occasion  did she

direct the attention of the king to a woman whose intellect might have

secured  after the spell of her beauty had ceased to attract him  the

young and the lovely were her victims only when their youth and their

loveliness were their sole attractions  she was ever ready to supply her

royal lover with a new mistress  but never with a friend  a companion 

or a counsellor  and then  as she had rightly foreseen  the french

sardanapalus soon became sated by the mere prettiness of his female

satellites  and returned to his allegiance to herself  weaned  and more

her slave than ever   2 



a curious parallel in this regard may be noted between the course of the

duchesse d etampes and the similar one pursued by madame de pompadour 

two centuries later  to maintain her power over the prematurely aged

louis xv  the policy of this  minister in petticoats  was embodied in

the institution of the famous  or infamous  parc aux cerfs 



the request of the emperor charles v  to be allowed to pass through

france on his way to chastise the rebellious people of ghent  and the

conflicting emotions to which it gave rise at the french court  have

been much discussed by historians  it seems to have been the case that

the connétable anne de montmorency  then in the prime of life  and whom

readers of the  two dianas  will remember in his old age as the loser of

the battle of saint laurent  and the favored rival of king henri ii  in

the affections of diane de poitiers  was the only one of the king s

advisers who opposed requiring charles to give sureties of his peaceable

intentions  and to declare in writing that he traversed france only upon

sufferance  the constable s advice was adopted  notwithstanding the

opposition of madame d etampes  who strongly urged the king to take

revenge for his own imprisonment at madrid by improving the opportunity

to inflict the same treatment upon his life long rival and adversary 

the incident of triboulet  the jester  and the tablets upon which he

inscribed the names of the greatest fools in the world  is historical 



the anecdote of the presentation of the diamond ring by the emperor to

the favorite is told by miss pardoe substantially as by dumas  but it is

rejected by most historians of the time  there is no question  however 

that the duchess was so alarmed by the condition of the king s health 

which was prematurely impaired by his dissolute life  and so

apprehensive of her own fate when he should be succeeded by the dauphin

henri  then a willing slave to the charms of her bitter enemy  diane de

poitiers  that she exerted herself to the utmost to win the affection of

the young duc d orléans  and to procure some sort of an independent

government for him  all her plans in that direction were defeated by

that prince s death of the plague in 1545 



the dazzling and voluptuous diane de poitiers  mistress of two kings of

france  the beautiful and accomplished  but cruel and treacherous

catherine de medicis  wife of one and mother of three  are familiar

historical characters  with whom dumas has dealt more fully in others of

his works 



the learned and accomplished author of the  heptameron   marguerite de

valois  queen of navarre and sister of françois i   of whom we obtain a

fleeting glimpse or two  is in many respects the most attractive

personality of the time  it is a cause for deep regret  however  that

her great affection for her brother did not lead her to exert her

undoubted influence over him to a better end 



as we pass from the king and his immediate circle  to glance for a

moment at the other characters  with whom and with certain passages in

their lives the romance before us is mainly concerned  we venture to

quote once more the same author so copiously quoted heretofore   



 one merit must  however  be conceded to anne de pisseleu  and as

throughout her whole career we have been unable to trace any other good

quality which she possessed  it cannot be passed over in silence 

educated highly for the period  she loved study for its own sake  and

afforded protection to men of letters  although it must be admitted

that  wherever her passions or vanity were brought into play  she

abandoned them and their interests without hesitation or scruple 

nevertheless it is certain that she co operated  not only willingly  but

even zealously  with the king  in attracting to the court of france all

the distinguished talent of europe   3 



the favorite s passions and vanity were brought into play in the ease of

benvenuto cellini  and she certainly abandoned him and his interests

without hesitation or scruple 



the principal source whence our knowledge of this extraordinary man is

drawn  is his own autobiography  which has been several times translated

into english  most recently by that eminent author and critic  the late

john addington symonds 



the following extracts from the translator s scholarly introduction will

serve a useful purpose in that they will show that the picture drawn of

him by dumas is in no sense exaggerated  and that he really possessed

the extraordinary characteristics attributed to him in the following

pages  and which would seem almost incredible without some confirmatory

evidence   



 a book which the great goethe thought worthy of translating into german

with the pen of  faust  and  wilhelm meister   a book which auguste

comte placed upon his very limited list for the perusal of reformed

humanity  is one with which we have the right to be occupied  not once

or twice  but over and over again 



                                                 



 no one was less introspective than this child of the italian

renaissance  no one was less occupied with thoughts about thinking or

with the presentation of psychological experience  vain  ostentatious 

self laudatory  and self engrossed as cellini was  he never stopped to

analyze himself        the word  confessions  could not have escaped his

lips  a  journal intime  would have been incomprehensible to his fierce 

virile spirit  his autobiography is the record of action and passion 

suffering  enjoying  enduring  working with restless activity  hating 

loving  hovering from place to place as impulse moves him  the man

presents himself dramatically by his deeds and spoken words  never by

his ponderings or meditative broodings 



 in addition to these solid merits  his life  as horace walpole put it 

is  more amusing than any novel   we have a real man to deal with   a

man so realistically brought before us that we seem to hear him speak

and see him move  a man  moreover  whose eminently characteristic works

of art in a great measure still survive among us  yet the adventures of

this potent human actuality will bear comparison with those of gil bias 

or the comte de monte cristo  or quentin durward  or les trois

mousquetaires  for their variety and pungent interest 



                                                 



 but what was the man himself  it is just this question which i have

half promised to answer  implying that  as a translator  i have some

special right to speak upon the subject 



 well  then  i seem to know cellini first of all as a man possessed by

intense  absorbing egotism  violent  arrogant  self assertive 

passionate  conscious of great gifts for art  physical courage  and

personal address        to be self reliant in all circumstances  to

scheme and strike  if need be  in support of his opinion or his right 

to take the law into his own hands for the redress of injury or

insult   this appeared to him the simple duty of an honorable man       

he possessed the temperament of a born artist  blent in almost equal

proportions with that of a born bravo  throughout the whole of his

tumultuous career these two strains contended in his nature for mastery 

upon the verge of fifty six  when a man s blood has generally cooled  we

find that he was released from prison on bail  and bound over to keep

the peace for a year with some enemy whose life was probably in danger 

and when i come to speak about his homicides  it will be obvious that he

enjoyed killing live men quite as much as casting bronze statues 



                                                 



 he consistently poses as an injured man  whom malevolent scoundrels and

malignant stars conspired to persecute  nor does he do this with any bad

faith  his belief in himself remained firm as adamant  and he candidly

conceived that he was under the special providence of a merciful and

loving god  who appreciated his high and virtuous qualities  



bearing in mind that all the seemingly fabulous anecdotes related of

cellini  or put into his own mouth  by dumas  are actually told by

himself in his autobiography  the conclusions of mr  symonds as to the

artist s veracity cannot fail to be interesting   



 among cellini s faults i do not reckon either baseness or lying  he was

not a rogue  and he meant to be veracious  this contradicts the

commonplace and superficial view of his character so flatly that i must

support my opinion at some length  of course i shall not deny that a

fellow endowed with such overweening self conceit  when he comes to

write about himself  will set down much which cannot be taken entirely

on trust        men of his stamp are certain to exaggerate their own

merits  and to pass lightly over things not favorable to the ideal they

present  but this is very different from lying  and of calculated

mendacity cellini stands almost universally accused  i believe that view

to be mistaken  



passing from general considerations to particular instances of cellini s

alleged falsehoods  the learned translator proceeds to discuss at some

length many of the miraculous experiences and remarkable statements of

cellini  which are to be found in these volumes  for example  the

founding of florence by an imaginary ancestor of his own  named fiorino

da cellino  a captain in the army of julius cæsar  and his claim that

he shot the constable of bourbon from the ramparts of rome in 1527  as

to which mr  symonds says   bourbon had been shot dead in the assault of

rome upon that foggy morning  and cellini had certainly discharged his

arquebuse from the ramparts        if it were possible to put his

thoughts about this event into a syllogism  it would run as follows 

 somebody shot bourbon  i shot somebody  being what i am  i am inclined

to think the somebody i shot was bourbon  



it would be a much simpler task to make a list of the fictitious

characters and incidents in  ascanio   than to enumerate those whose

existence or occurrence is well authenticated  colombe and her governess

are apparently creations of the novelist s brain  and the same is true

of hermann  little jehan  jacques aubry and his light o  love  the

provost of paris was jean d estouteville  not robert d estourville  but

he was actually in possession of the petit nesle  which was the abode

granted to benvenuto by a deed which is still extant  as are the letters

of naturalization bestowed upon him  the trouble experienced by cellini

in obtaining possession of the petit nesle is considerably overdrawn 

and it does not appear that ascanio was ever imprisoned  ascanio s

character throughout is represented in a different light from that in

which it appears in the autobiography  although he is there said to be

 a lad of marvellous talents  and  moreover  so fair of person that

every one who once set eyes on him seemed bound to love him beyond

measure   benvenuto had much trouble with him  and used continually to

beat him  and he was very wroth when he found that his apprentice had

been using the head of the mammoth statue of mars as a trysting place 

where he was accustomed to meet a frail damsel of his acquaintance 

benvenuto tells the story of the injury to the hand of raffaello del

moro s daughter  and of his own share in her cure  but the element of

romance is altogether wanting in his own narrative of the relations

between himself and that  very beautiful  young woman 



catherine and scozzone  scorzone  were two women  not one  both models

and ephemeral mistresses of the artist  the episode of the amours of

pagolo and catherine is a very much softened version of an almost

unreadable passage in the memoirs  of the episode itself  as told by

cellini  mr  symonds says that it is one over which his biographers

would willingly draw the veil 



it is impossible to imagine a more natural consequence of benvenuto s

peculiar temperament than his absolute failure to make himself  persona

grata  to the arrogant  self seeking mistress of the king of france 

françois was oftentimes hard put to it to reconcile his admiration for

the work of the artist with his desire to please the favorite  but in

presence of one of his masterpieces the former sentiment generally

carried the day   notably on the occasion of the exhibition of the

jupiter at fontainebleau  in competition with the antique statues

brought from rome by primaticcio  after describing the scene in the

gallery substantially as it is described in the novel  cellini says 

 the king departed sooner than he would otherwise have done    on

account of the rage of the duchess    calling aloud  however  to

encourage me   i have brought from italy the greatest man who ever

lived  endowed with all the talents   



a passage in mr  symonds s introduction to the life  too long to be

quoted here  shows that benvenuto left france somewhat under a cloud 

and followed by suspicions of dishonest dealing  which have never been

quite satisfactorily cleared away 



enough has been said to show that in this book  as always in his

historical romances  dumas has substantially rewritten a chapter of

history   for the visit of benvenuto cellini to paris has been deemed

worthy of notice at considerable length by more than one grave

chronicler  and he has again demonstrated his very exceptional power of

interweaving history and fiction in such a way as to make each embellish

the other

the street and the studio





time  four o clock in the afternoon of the tenth day of july in the year

of grace 1540  place  the entrance to the church des grands augustins 

within the precincts of the university  by the receptacle for holy water

near the door 



a tall  handsome youth  olive skinned  with long waving locks and great

black eyes  simply but elegantly clad  his only weapon a little dagger

with a hilt of marvellous workmanship  was standing there  and 

doubtless from motives of pure piety and humility  had not stirred from

the spot throughout the vespers service  with head bowed in an attitude

of devout contemplation  he was murmuring beneath his breath i know not

what words   his prayers let us hope   for he spoke so low that none but

himself and god could hear what he might say  as the service drew near

its close  however  he raised his voice slightly  and they who stood

nearest him could hear these half audible words   



 how wretchedly these french monks drone out their psalms  could they

not sing more melodiously before her  whose ear should be accustomed to

angels  voices  ah  this is well  the vespers are at an end at last  mon

dieu  mon dieu  grant that i be more fortunate to day than on last

sunday  and that she do at least raise her eyes to my face  



this last prayer was most artful  in very truth  for if she to whom it

was addressed should chance to raise her eyes to the suppliant s face 

she would see the most adorable youthful head that she had ever seen in

dreams  while reading the eleven mythological tales which were so

fashionable at the time  by virtue of the charming couplets of master

clement marot  and which told of the loves of psyche and the death of

narcissus  indeed  beneath his simple sober hued costume  the youth whom

we have introduced to our readers was remarkably handsome  and wore an

air of unmistakable refinement  moreover  his smile was infinitely sweet

and attractive  and his glance  which dared not yet be bold  was as

ardent and impassioned as ever flashed from the great speaking eyes of

eighteen years 



meanwhile  upon hearing the movement of many chairs announcing the end

of the service  our lover   for the reader will have discovered from the

few words he has uttered that he is entitled to be so described   our

lover  i say  drew aside a little  and watched the congregation pass

silently forth   a congregation composed of staid church wardens 

respectable matrons past their giddy days  and prepossessing damsels 

but for none of these had the youth come thither  for his glance did not

brighten  nor did he step impulsively forward  until he saw approach a

maiden dressed in white  and attended by a duenna   a duenna of high

station  be it understood   who seemed accustomed to the ways of

society  a duenna not unyouthful nor unattractive  and by no means

savage in appearance  when the two ladies approached the basin of holy

water  our youth took some of the liquid and gallantly offered it to

them 



the duenna bestowed the most gracious of smiles and most grateful of

courtesies upon him  and even touched his fingers as she took the cup 

which  to his great chagrin  she herself handed to her companion  but

the latter  notwithstanding the fervent prayer whereof she had been the

object a few moments before  kept her eyes constantly upon the

ground   a sure proof that she knew the comely youth was there   so that

the comely youth  when she had passed  stamped upon the flags 

muttering   alas  again she did not see me   an equally sure proof that

the comely youth was  as we have said  no more than eighteen years old 



but after the first burst of vexation  our unknown hastened down the

steps of the church  and  seeing that the absent minded beauty  having

lowered her veil and taken her attendant s arm  had turned to the right 

hastened to take the same direction  observing that his own home chanced

to lie that way  the maiden followed the quay as far as pont

saint michel  and crossed pont saint michel  still it was our hero s

road  she next passed through rue de la barillerie  and crossed pont au

change  and as she was still pursuing our hero s road  our hero followed

her like her shadow 



every pretty girl s shadow is a lover 



but alas  when she reached the grand châtelet  the lovely star  whereof

our unknown had made himself the satellite  was suddenly eclipsed  the

wicket of the royal prison opened the instant that the duenna knocked 

and closed again behind them 



the young man was taken aback for a moment  but as he was a very decided

fellow when there was no pretty girl at hand to weaken his resolution 

he very soon made up his mind what course to pursue 



a sergeant  pike on shoulder  was walking sedately back and forth before

the door of the châtelet  our youthful unknown followed the example of

the worthy sentinel  and  having walked on a short distance to avoid

observation  but not so far as to lose sight of the door  he heroically

began his amorous sentry go 



if the reader has ever done sentry duty in the course of his life  he

must have noticed that one of the surest means of making the time pass

quickly is to commune with one s self  our hero doubtless was accustomed

to such duty  for he had hardly begun his promenade when he addressed

the following monologue to himself   



 assuredly it cannot be that she lives in yonder prison  this morning

after mass  and these last two sundays when i dared not follow her save

with my eyes   dullard that i was   she turned not to the right upon the

quay  but to the left  toward the porte de nesle  and the

pré aux cleres  what the devil brings her to the châtelet  what can it

be  to see a prisoner  perhaps  her brother  t is most like  poor girl 

she must suffer cruelly  for doubtless she is as sweet and kind as she

is lovely  pardieu  i m sorely tempted to accost her  ask her frankly

who it is  and offer my services  if it be her brother  i ll tell the

patron the whole story  and ask his advice  when one has escaped from

the castle of san angelo  as he has  one has a shrewd idea of the best

way to get out of prison  there s no more to be said  i ll save her

brother  after i have rendered him such a service  he ll be my friend

for life and death  of course he ll ask me then what he can do for me

when i have done so much for him  then i ll confess that i love his

sister  he ll present me to her  and then we ll see if she won t raise

her eyes  



once launched upon such a course  we need not say how a lover s thoughts

flow on unchecked  thus it was that our youth was vastly amazed to hear

the clock strike four  and see the sentinel relieved 



the new sergeant began his promenade  and the young man resumed his  his

method of passing time had succeeded too well for him not to continue to

make use of it  so he resumed his discourse upon a theme no less

fruitful of ideas than the other   



 how lovely she is  how graceful every movement  how modest her bearing 

how classic the outline of her features  there is in the whole world no

other than leonardo da vinci or the divine raphael  worthy to reproduce

the image of that chaste and spotless being  nor would they prove equal

to the task  save at the very zenith of their talent  o mon dieu  why am

not i a painter  rather than a sculptor  worker in enamel  or goldsmith 

first of all  were i a painter  there d be no need that i should have

her before my eyes to make her portrait  i should never cease to see her

great blue eyes  her beautiful blonde tresses  her pearly skin and

slender form  were i a painter  i should paint her face in every

picture  as sanzio did with fornarina  and andrea del sarto with

lucrezia  and what a contrast betwixt her and fornarina  in sooth 

neither the one nor the other is worthy to unloose her shoe laces  in

the first place  fornarina   



the youth was not at the end of his comparisons  which were  as the

reader will imagine  uniformly to the advantage of his inamorata  when

the hour struck 



the second sentinel was relieved 



 six o clock   t is strange how the time flies   muttered the youth 

 and if it flies thus quickly while i wait for her  how should it be if

i were by her side  ah  by her side i should lose count of time  i

should be in paradise  if i were by her side  i should but look at her 

and so the hours and days and months would pass  what a blissful life

that would be  mon dieu   and the young man lost himself in an ecstatic

reverie  for his mistress  though absent  seemed to pass in person

before his eyes   the eyes of a true artist 



the third sentinel was relieved 



eight o clock struck on all the parish churches  and the shades of night

began to fall  for all authorities are in accord that the twilight hour

in july three hundred years ago was in the neighborhood of eight

o clock  as now  but what is perhaps more astonishing than that is the

fabulous perseverance of a sixteenth century lover  all passions were

ardent in those days  and vigorous young hearts no more stopped short in

love than in art or war 



however  the patience of the young artist  for he has let us into the

secret of his profession  was rewarded at last  when he saw the

ponderous door of the châtelet open for the twentieth time  but this

time to give passage to her for whom he was waiting  the same chaperon

was still at her side  and furthermore  two archers of the provost s

guard followed ten paces behind her  as escort 



they retraced the steps they had taken four hours earlier  to wit the

pont au change  rue de la barillerie  pont saint michel  and the quays 

but they kept on by the grands augustins  and some three hundred yards

beyond paused before a huge door in a recess in the wall  beside which

was another smaller door for the servants  use  the duenna knocked at

the great door  which was opened by the porter  the two archers  after

saluting their charge with the utmost respect  returned to the

châtelet  and our artist found himself standing for the second time

outside a closed door 



he would probably have remained there until morning  for he was fairly

embarked on the fourth series of his dreams  but chance willed that a

passer by  who had imbibed something too freely  collided violently with

him 



 hola there  friend   said the new arrival   by your leave  are you a

man or a post  if so be you re a post  you re within your rights and i

respect you  but if you be a man  stand back  and let me pass  



 pray pardon me   rejoined the distraught youth   but i am a stranger in

this good city of paris  and   



 oh  that s another matter  the frenchman is always hospitable  and i

ask your pardon  you re a stranger  good  as you have told me who you

are  it s only fair that i should tell you who i am  i am a student  and

my name is   



 excuse me   interposed the young artist   but before i know who you

are  i would be very glad to know where i am  



 porte de nesle  my dear friend  this is the hôtel de nesle   said the

student  with a glance at the great door from which the stranger had not

once removed his eyes 



 very good  and to reach rue saint martin  where i live  which direction

must i take   said our lovelorn youth  for the sake of saying something 

and hoping thus to be rid of his companion 



 rue saint martin  do you say  come with me  i m going that way  and at

pont saint michel i ll show you how you must go  as i was saying  i am a

student  i am returning from the pré aux clercs  and my name is   



 do you know to whom the hôtel de nesle belongs   asked the young

stranger 



 marry  i rather think i know my university  the hôtel de nesle  young

man  belongs to our lord  the king  and is at this moment in the hands

of robert d estourville  provost of paris  



 how say you  that the provost of paris lives there  



 by no means did i tell you that the provost of paris lives there  my

son  the provost of paris lives at the grand châtelet  



 ah  yes  at the grand châtelet  then that s the explanation  but how

happens it that the provost lives at the grand châtelet  and yet the

king leaves the hôtel de nesle in his possession  



  t is thus  the king  you see  had given the hôtel de nesle to our

bailli  a most venerable man  who stood guard over the privileges of the

university  and tried all suits against it in most paternal fashion 

superb functions his  unhappily our excellent bailli was so just  so

just  to us  that his office was abolished two years since  upon the

pretext that he used to sleep when hearing causes  as if  bailli  were

not derived from  bâiller   to yawn   his office being thus suppressed 

the duty of protecting the interests of the university was intrusted to

the provost of paris  a fine protector  on my word  as if we could not

quite as well protect ourselves  how  our said provost  dost thou follow

me  my child   our said provost  who is most rapacious  opined that 

since he succeeded to the bailli s office  he ought at the same time to

inherit his possessions  and so he quietly laid hold of the grand and

petit nesle  thanks to the patronage of madame d etampes  



 and yet  you say  he does not occupy it  



 not he  the villain  i think  however  that the old cassandre lodges a

daughter there  or niece  a lovely child called colombe or colombine  or

some such name  and keeps her under lock and key in a corner of the

petit nesle  



 ah  is it so   exclaimed the artist  hardly able to breathe  for it was

the first time that he had heard his mistress s name   this usurpation

seems to me a shocking abuse  what  this vast hotel to shelter one young

girl with her duenna  



 whence comest thou  o stranger  not to know that nothing comes to pass

more naturally than this abuse   that we poor clerks should live six

together in a wretched garret  while a great nobleman casts this immense

property with its gardens  lawns  and tennis court to the dogs  



 ah  there is a tennis court  



 magnificent  my son  magnificent  



 but this hôtel de nesle  you say  is actually the property of king

françois i  



 to be sure  but what would you have king françois i  do with this

property of his  



 why  give it to others  as the provost doesn t occupy it  



 very good  then go and ask it of him for yourself  



 why not  tell me  does the game of tennis please your fancy  



 i fairly dote on it  



 in that case i invite you to a game with me next sunday  



 where  pray  



 at the hôtel de nesle  



 gramercy  my lord grand master of the royal châteaux   t is meet that

you should know my name at least   



but as the young stranger knew all that he cared to know  and as the

rest probably interested him but little  he heard not a word of his new

friend s story  as he proceeded to tell him in detail that his name was

jacques aubry  that he was a scrivener at the university  and was now

returning from the pré aux clercs  where he had had an assignation with

his tailor s wife  that she  detained no doubt by her wrathful spouse 

did not appear  that he had consoled himself for simonne s absence by

drinking good suresne  and  lastly  that he proposed to withdraw his

custom from the discourteous master snip  who compelled him to wear

himself out with waiting  and to get tipsy which was altogether opposed

to all his habits 



when the two young men reached rue de la harpe  jacques aubry pointed

out to our unknown the road he was to follow  which he knew even better

than his informant  they then made an appointment for the following

sunday at noon at the porte de nesle  and parted  one singing  the other

dreaming 



he who dreamed had abundant food for dreaming  for he had learned more

during that one evening than in the three weeks preceding 



he had learned that the maiden to whom he had given his heart  lived at

the petit nesle  that she was the daughter of messire robert

d estourville  provost of paris  and that her name was colombe  as will

be seen  he had not wasted his day 



still dreaming he turned into rue saint martin  and stopped before a

handsome house  over the door of which were carved the arms of the

cardinal of ferrara  he knocked three times 



 who s there   demanded a fresh  resonant young voice from within  after

an interval of a few seconds 



 i  dame catherine   replied the unknown 



 who are you  



 ascanio  



 ah  at last  



the door opened  and ascanio entered 



a charming girl of some eighteen to twenty years  rather dark  rather

small  very quick of movement  and admirably well shaped withal 

welcomed him with transports of joy 



 here s the deserter  here he is   she cried  and ran  or rather bounded

on before  to announce him  extinguishing the lamp she carried  and

leaving open the street door  which ascanio  less giddy pated than she 

was careful to secure 



the young man  although dame catherine s precipitation left him in

darkness  walked with assured step across a courtyard of considerable

size  in which every tile was surrounded by a border of rank weeds  the

whole dominated by a sombre mass of tall buildings of somewhat severe

aspect  it was the frowning and humid dwelling place of a cardinal 

although its master had not for a long time dwelt therein 



ascanio sprang lightly up a flight of moss grown steps  and entered a

vast hall  the only room in the house that was lighted   a sort of

conventual refectory  ordinarily dark and gloomy and untenanted  but

which for two months past had been filled with light and life and music 



for two months past  in truth  this cold colossal cell had been instinct

with bustling  laughing  good humored life  for two months past  ten

work benches  two anvils  and an improvised forge had seemed to lessen

the size of the vast room  sketches  models  benches laden with pincers 

hammers  and files  sheaves of swords with chased hilts of marvellous

workmanship  and carved open work blades  helmets  cuirasses  and

bucklers  gold embossed  whereon the loves of the gods and goddesses

were portrayed in relief  as if to turn the mind away from the purpose

for which they were destined to be used  had covered the grayish walls 

the sun had freely found its way in through the wide open windows  and

the air had been filled with the songs of joyous  active workers 



a cardinal s refectory had become a goldsmith s workshop 



however  during this evening of july 10  1540  the sanctity of the

sabbath had temporarily restored to the newly enlivened apartment the

tranquillity in which it had lain dormant for a century  but a table 

upon which the remains of an excellent supper lay about in confusion 

lighted by a lamp which one would take to have been stolen from the

ruins of pompeii  of so chaste and delicate a form was it  proved that 

if the temporary occupants of the cardinal s mansion did sometimes enjoy

repose  they were in no wise addicted to fasting 



when ascanio entered there were four persons in the workshop 



these four persons were an old maid servant  who was removing the dishes

from the table  catherine  who was relighting the lamp  a young man

sketching in a corner  and waiting for the lamp which catherine had

taken from before him in order to continue his work  and the master 

standing with folded arms  and leaning against the forge 



the last would inevitably have been the first to be observed by any one

entering the workshop 



indeed  there was an indescribable impression of life and power which

emanated from this remarkable personage  and attracted the attention

even of those who would have chosen to withhold it  he was a tall 

spare  powerful man of some forty years  but it would have needed the

chisel of michel angelo or the pencil of ribeira to trace the outline of

that clear cut profile  to reproduce that sparkling olive complexion  to

depict that bold  almost kingly expression  his lofty forehead towered

above eyebrows quick to frown  his straight forward piercing glance

flashed at times with a light that was almost sublime  his frank 

good humored smile  albeit somewhat satirical  fascinated and awed you

at the same time  he was accustomed to stroke his black beard and

moustache with his hand  which was not precisely small  but nervous 

supple  with long fingers and great strength  but withal slender and

aristocratic  lastly  in his way of looking at you  speaking  turning

his head  in all his quick  expressive  but not intemperate gestures 

even in the careless attitude in which he was standing when ascanio

entered  his strength made itself felt  the lion in repose was none the

less the lion 



catherine and the apprentice working in the corner formed a most

striking contrast to each other  the latter  a sombre  taciturn fellow 

with a narrow forehead already furrowed with wrinkles  half shut eyes 

and compressed lips  she as blithe as a bird and blooming as a flower 

with the most mischievous of eyes always to be seen beneath her restless

eyelids  and the whitest of teeth within her mouth  constantly half

opened with a smile  the apprentice  buried in his corner  was slow and

languid in his movements  as if economizing his strength  catherine was

here and there  going and coming  never remaining one second in one

spot  so did her youthful active organization overflow with life and

spirits  and feel the need of constant movement in default of

excitement 



thus she was the fairy of the household  a very skylark by virtue of

her vivacity  and her clear  piercing note  beginning life with such a

joyous disregard of every thing beyond the moment as to fully justify

the surname of  scozzone  which the master had given her  an italian

word which signified then  and still signifies  something very like

 casse cou   break neck   and yet  with all her childish ways  scozzone

was so instinct with witchery and charm that she was the life and soul

of the household  when she sang all the others were silent  when she

laughed they laughed with her  when she ordered they obeyed without a

word   albeit she was not ordinarily exacting in her caprice  and then

she was so frankly and innocently happy  that she diffused an atmosphere

of good humor wherever she went  and it made others glad to see her

gladness 



her story was an old  old story  to which we may perhaps recur  an

orphan  born of the people  she was abandoned in her infancy  but god

protected her  destined to afford pleasure to everybody  she met a man

to whom she afforded pure happiness 



having introduced these new characters  we now resume the thread of our

narrative where we let it drop 



 aha  whence comest thou  gadabout   said the master to ascanio 



 whence do i come  i come from gadding about for you  master  



 since morning  



 since morning  



 say rather that thou hast been in quest of adventure  



 what manner of adventure should i have been in quest of  master  

murmured ascanio 



 how can i know  pray  



 well  well  and if it were so  where s the harm   interposed scozzone 

 indeed  he s a pretty boy enough to have adventures run after him  even

though he run not after adventures  



 scozzone   said the master with a frown 



 come  come  don t you be jealous of him  too  poor  dear boy   and she

raised ascanio s chin with her hand   ah  well  it only needed that 

but  jesu  how pale you are  does it happen that you haven t supped 

monsieur vagabond  



 faith  no   cried ascanio   i forgot it  



 oho  in that case i take sides with the master  he forgot that he had

not supped  so he must be in love  ruperta  ruperta  bring supper for

messire ascanio at once  



the servant produced several dishes of appetizing relics of the evening

meal  which our hero pounced upon with an appetite by no means unnatural

after his prolonged exercise in the open air 



scozzone and the master watched him  smiling the while  one with

sisterly affection  the other with a father s love  the young man at

work in the corner had raised his head when ascanio entered  but as soon

as scozzone replaced in front of him the lamp she had taken when she

rail to open the door  he bent his head over his work once more 



 i was saying  master  that it was for you i have been running about all

day   resumed ascanio  noticing the mischievous expression of the master

and scozzone  and desiring to lead the conversation to some other

subject than his love affairs 



 how hast thou run about all day for me  let us hear  



 did you not say yesterday that the light was very bad here  and that

you must have another studio  



 even so  



 well  i have found one for you  



 dost thou hear  pagolo   said the master  turning to the young man in

the corner 



 what did you say  master   he asked  raising his head a second time 



 come  lay aside thy work a moment  and listen to this  he has found a

workshop  dost thou hear  



 pardon  master  but i can hear very well from here what my friend

ascanio may say  i would like to complete this study  it seems to me

that it is well  when one has piously fulfilled the duties of a

christian on the sabbath day  to employ one s leisure in some profitable

exercise  to work is to pray  



 pagolo  my friend   said the master  shaking his head more in sadness

than in anger   you would do better  believe me  to work more

assiduously and heartily through the week  and enjoy yourself on sunday

like a good comrade  than to idle as you do on ordinary days  and

hypocritically set yourself apart from the others by feigning so much

ardor in your work on fete days  but you are your own master  act as

seems good to you  and thou sayest  ascanio  my child   he continued in

a tone in which infinite gentleness and affection were mingled 



 i say that i have found a magnificent workshop for you  



 where  



 do you know the hôtel de nesle  



 perfectly  that is  by having passed before it  for i have never been

within the door  



 but is its exterior attractive in your eyes  



 pardieu  it is indeed  but   



 but what  



 but does no one occupy it  pray  



 marry  yes  monsieur the provost of paris  messire robert

d estourville  who has taken possession of it without right  moreover 

to satisfy your scruples on that head  we might with great propriety

leave him the petit nesle  where some one of his family now dwells  i

think  and be content ourselves with the grand nesle  and its

courtyards  lawns  and bowling greens and tennis court  



 there is a tennis court  



 finer than that of santa croce at florence  



 per bacco  and it is my favorite game  thou didst know that  ascanio  



 yes  and then  master  over and above all that  a superb location  air

everywhere  and such air  perfect country air  and not such as we get

here in this infernal corner  where we are moulding  forgotten by the

sun  the pré aux clercs on one side  the seine on the other  and the

king  your great king  only two steps away  in his louvre  



 but whose is this devil of a hotel  



 whose  say you  pardieu  the king s  



 the king s  say me that once more  my child   the hôtel de nesle is

the king s  



 his own  now it remains to ascertain if he will give you so magnificent

a dwelling place  



 who  the king  how do men call the king  ascanio 



 why  françois i  if i am not mistaken  



 which means that the hôtel de nesle will be my property within the

week  



 but it may be that the provost of paris will take offence  



 what care i for that  



 but suppose he will not let go what he has in his hand  



 suppose he will not   what do men call me  ascanio  



 they call you benvenuto cellini  master  



 which means that if the worthy provost will not do things with good

grace  why  we will use force to compel him to do them  and now let us

to bed  to morrow we ll speak further on the matter  and then the sun

will shine  and we shall see more clearly  



at the master s suggestion all retired except pagolo  who remained for

some time at work in his corner  but as soon as he believed that all

were safely in bed  the apprentice rose  looked about  drew near the

table  and poured for himself a large cup of wine  which he swallowed at

a draught  then he too went off to bed 









ii





a goldsmith of the sixteenth century





since we have drawn the portrait and mentioned the name of benvenuto

cellini  we crave the reader s permission  that he may the more

understandingly approach the artistic subject of which we propose to

treat  to indulge in a short digression upon this extraordinary man  who

at this time had been living in france for two months  and who is

destined to become one of the principal characters of this history 



but first of all let us say a word as to the goldsmiths of the sixteenth

century 



there is at florence a bridge called the ponte vecchio  which is covered

with houses to this day  these houses were in the old days goldsmiths 

shops 



but the word is not to be understood as we understand it to day  the

goldsmith of our day follows a trade  formerly  the goldsmith was an

artist 



so it was that there was nothing in the world so wondrously beautiful as

these shops  or rather as the articles with which they were stocked 

there were round cups of onyx  around which dragons  tails were twined 

while heads and bodies of those fabulous creatures confronted one

another with gold bespangled sky blue wings outspread  and with jaws

wide open like chimeras  shot threatening glances from their ruby eyes 

there were ewers of agate  with a festoon of ivy clinging round the

base  and climbing up in guise of handle well above the orifice 

concealing amid its emerald foliage some marvellous bird from the

tropics  in brilliant plumage of enamel  seemingly alive and ready to

burst forth in song  there were urns of lapis lazuli  over the edge of

which leaned  as if to drink  lizards chiselled with such art that one

could almost see the changing reflection of their golden cuirasses  and

might have thought that they would fly at the least sound  and seek

shelter in some crevice in the wall  then there were chalices and

monstrances  and bronze and gold and silver medallions  all studded with

precious stones  as if in those days rubies  topazes  carbuncles  and

diamonds could be found by searching in the sand on river banks  or in

the dust of the highroad  and there were nymphs  naiads  gods 

goddesses  a whole resplendent olympus  mingled with crucifixes 

crosses  and calvarys  mater dolorosas  venuses  christs  apollos 

jupiters launching thunderbolts  and jehovahs creating the world  and

all this not only cleverly executed  but poetically conceived  not only

admirable  viewed as ornaments for a woman s boudoir  but magnificent

masterpieces fit to immortalize the reign of a king or the genius of a

nation 



to be sure  the goldsmiths of that epoch bore the names of donatello 

ghiberti  guirlandajo  and benvenuto cellini 



now  benvenuto cellini has himself described in his memoirs  which are

more interesting than the most interesting novel  the adventurous life

of the artists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries  when titian was

painting in coat of mail  when michel angelo was sculpturing with his

sword at his side  when masaccio and domenichino died of poison  and

cosmo i  secluded himself in his laboratory to discover the mode of

tempering steel so that it would cut porphyry 



to show the character of the man  we will take a single episode in his

life   that which was the occasion of his coming to france 



benvenuto was at rome  whither pope clement vii  had summoned him  and

was at work with characteristic ardor upon the beautiful chalice which

his holiness had ordered  but as he desired to display his talent at its

best upon the precious work  he made but slow progress  how  benvenuto 

as may well be imagined  had many rivals  who envied him the many

valuable orders he received from the pope  as well as the marvellous

skill with which he executed them  the result was that one of his

confrères  named pompeo  who had nothing to do but slander his betters 

took advantage of the delay to do him all possible injury in the pope s

sight  and kept at work persistently  day in and day out  without truce

or relaxation  sometimes in undertones  sometimes aloud  assuring him

that he would never finish it  and that he was so overwhelmed with

orders that he executed those of other people to the neglect of his

holiness s 



he said and did so much  did good pompeo  that when benvenuto cellini

saw him enter his workshop one day with smiling faee  he divined at once

that he was the bearer of bad news for him 



 well  my dear confrère   pompeo began   i have come to relieve you

from a heavy burden  his holiness realizes that your neglect in

completing his chalice is not due to lack of zeal  but to lack of time 

he therefore considers it no more than just to relieve you from some one

of your important duties  and of his own motion he dismisses you from

the post of engraver to the mint  it will be nine paltry ducats a month

less in your pocket  but an hour more each day at your disposal  



benvenuto was conscious of an intense longing to throw the jeering

varlet out of window  but he restrained his feelings  and pompeo  seeing

that not a muscle of his face moved  thought that he had missed his aim 



 furthermore   he continued   why  i know not  but in spite of all that

i could say in your behalf  his holiness demands his chalice at once  in

whatever condition it may be  verily  i am afraid  dear benvenuto  i say

it in all friendliness  that  t is his purpose to have some other finish

it  



 oh  no  not that   cried the goldsmith  starting up like one bitten by

a serpent   my chalice is my own  even as the office at the mint is the

pope s  his holiness hath no right to do more than bid me return the

five hundred crowns paid to me in advance  and i will dispose of my work

as may seem good to me  



 beware  my master   said pompeo   imprisonment may be the sequel of

your refusal  



 signore pompeo  you re an ass   retorted benvenuto 



pompeo left the shop in a rage 



on the following day two of the holy father s chamberlains called upon

benvenuto cellini 



 the pope has sent us   said one of them   either to receive the chalice

at your hands  or to take you to prison  



 monsignori   rejoined benvenuto   an artist like myself deserved no

less than to be given in charge to functionaries like yourselves  here i

am  take me to prison  but i give you fair warning that all this will

not put the pope s chalice forward one stroke of the graver  



benvenuto went with them to the governor of the prison  who  having

doubtless received his instructions in advance  invited him to dine with

him  throughout the repast the governor used every conceivable argument

to induce benvenuto to satisfy the pope by carrying the chalice to him 

assuring him that  if he would make that concession  clement vii  

violent and obstinate as he was  would forget his displeasure  but the

artist replied that he had already shown the holy father his chalice six

times since he began it  and that was all that could justly be

required of him  moreover  he said he knew his holiness  and that he was

not to be trusted  that he might very well  when he had the chalice in

his hands  take it from him altogether  and give it to some idiot to

finish  who would spoil it  he reiterated his readiness to return the

five hundred crowns paid in advance 



having said so much  benvenuto met all subsequent arguments of the

governor by exalting his cook to the skies  and praising his wines 



after dinner  all his compatriots  all his dearest friends  all his

apprentices  led by ascanio  called upon him to implore him not to rush

headlong to destruction by resisting the commands of clement vii   but

benvenuto told them that he had long desired to establish the great

truth that a goldsmith can be more obstinate than a pope  and as the

most favorable opportunity he could ask for was now at hand  he

certainly would not let it pass  for fear that it might not return 



his compatriots withdrew  shrugging their shoulders  his friends vowing

that he was mad  and ascanio weeping bitterly 



fortunately pompeo did not forget cellini  and meanwhile he was saying

slyly to the pope   



 most holy father  give your servant a free hand  i will send word to

this obstinate fellow that  since he is so determined  he may send me

the five hundred crowns  as he is a notorious spendthrift he will not

have that sum at his disposal  and will be compelled to give up the

chalice to me  



clement considered this an excellent device  and bade pompeo do as he

suggested  and so  that same evening  as cellini was about to be taken

to the cell assigned him  a chamberlain made his appearance  and

informed the goldsmith that his holiness accepted his ultimatum  and

demanded the delivery of the chalice or the five hundred crowns without

delay 



benvenuto replied that they had but to take him to his workshop  and he

would give them the five hundred crowns 



he was escorted thither by four swiss  accompanied by the chamberlain 

he entered his bedroom  drew a key from his pocket  opened a small iron

closet built into the wall  plunged his hand into a large bag  took out

five hundred crowns  and  having given them to the chamberlain  showed

him and the four swiss the door  it should be said  in justice to

benvenuto cellini  that they received four crowns for their trouble  and

in justice to the swiss  that they kissed his hands as they took their

leave 



the chamberlain returned forthwith to the holy father  and delivered the

five hundred crowns  whereupon his holiness  in his desperation  flew

into a violent rage  and began to abuse pompeo 



 go thyself to my great engraver at his workshop  animal   he said 

 employ all the soothing arguments of which thy ignorant folly is

capable  and say to him that if he will consent to finish my chalice  i

will give him whatever facilities he may require  



 but  your holiness   said pompeo   will it not be time to morrow

morning  



 i fear lest it be already too late this evening  imbecile  and i do not

choose that benvenuto shall sleep upon his wrath  therefore do my

bidding on the instant  and let me not fail to have a favorable reply

to morrow morning at my levée  



pompeo thereupon left the vatican with drooping feathers  and repaired

to benvenuto s workshop  it was closed 



he peered through the key hole and through the cracks in the door  and

scrutinized all the windows  one after another  to see if there was not

one which showed a light  but all were dark  he ventured to knock a

second time somewhat louder than at first  and then a third time  still

louder 



thereupon a window on the first floor opened  and benvenuto appeared in

his shirt  arquebus in hand 



 who s there   he demanded 



 i   the messenger replied 



 who art thou   rejoined the goldsmith  although he recognized his man

at once 



 pompeo  



 thou liest   said benvenuto   i know pompeo well  and he is far too

great a coward to venture out into the streets of rome at this hour  



 but  my dear cellini  i swear   



 hold thy peace  thou art a villain  and hast taken the poor devil s

name to induce me to open my door  and then to rob me  



 master benvenuto  may i die   



 say but another word   cried benvenuto  pointing the arquebus toward

his interlocutor   and that wish of thine will be gratified  



pompeo fled at full speed  crying  murder   and disappeared around the

corner of the nearest street 



benvenuto thereupon closed his window  hung his arquebus on its nail 

and went to bed once more  laughing in his beard at poor pompeo s

fright 



the next morning  as he went down to his shop  which had been opened an

hour earlier by his apprentices  he spied pompeo on the opposite side of

the street  where he had been doing sentry duty since daybreak  waiting

to see him descend 



as soon as he saw cellini  pompeo waved his hand to him in the most

affectionately friendly way imaginable 



 aha   said cellini   is it you  my dear pompeo  by my faith  i was

within an ace last night of making a churl pay dearly for his insolence

in assuming your name  



 indeed   said pompeo  forcing himself to smile  and drawing gradually

nearer to the shop   how did it happen  pray  



benvenuto thereupon described the incident to his holiness s messenger 

but as his friend benvenuto had described him in their nocturnal

interview as a coward  pompeo did not dare confess his identity with the

visitor  when his tale was finished  cellini asked pompeo to what happy

circumstance he was indebted for the honor of so early a visit from him 



pompeo thereupon acquitted himself  but in somewhat different terms  be

it understood  of the errand upon which clement vii  had sent him to his

goldsmith  benvenuto s features expanded as he proceeded  clement vii 

yielded   ergo  the goldsmith had been more obstinate than the pope 



 say to his holiness   said benvenuto  when the message was duly

delivered   that i shall be very happy to obey him  and to do anything

in my power to regain his favor  which i have lost  not by any fault of

my own  but through the evil machinations of envious rivals  as for

yourself  signore pompeo  as the pope does not lack retainers  i counsel

you  in your own interest  to look to it that another than you is sent

to me hereafter  for your health s sake  signore pompeo  interfere no

more in my affairs  in pity for yourself  never happen in my path  and

for the welfare of my soul  pompeo  pray god that i be not your cæsar  



pompeo waited to hear no more  but returned to clement vii  with

cellini s reply  of which  however  he suppressed the peroration 



some time thereafter  in order to put the seal to his reconciliation

with benvenuto  clement vii  ordered his medallion struck by him 

benvenuto struck it in bronze  in silver  and in gold  and then carried

it to him  the pope was so enraptured with it that he cried out in his

admiration  that so beautiful a medallion had never been produced by the

ancients 



 ah  well  your holiness   said benvenuto   had not i displayed some

firmness  we should have been at enmity to day  for i would never have

forgiven you  and you would have lost a devoted servant  look you  holy

bather   he continued  by way of good counsel   your holiness would not

do ill to remember now and then the opinion of many discreet folk  that

one should bleed seven times before cutting once  and you would do well

also to allow yourself to be something less easily made the dupe of

lying tongues and envious detractors  so much for your guidance in

future  and we will say no more about it  most holy father  



thus did benvenuto pardon clement vii   which he certainly would not

have done had he loved him less  but  as his compatriot  he was deeply

attached to him  great  therefore  was his sorrow when the pope suddenly

died  a few months subsequent to the episode we have described  the man

of iron burst into tears at the news  and for a week he wept like a

child  the pontiff s demise was doubly calamitous to poor cellini  on

the very day of his burial he met pompeo  whom he had not seen since the

day when he bade him spare him the too frequent infliction of his

presence 



it should be said that since cellini s dire threats  the unhappy pompeo

had not dared to go out unless accompanied by a dozen men well armed  to

whom he gave the same pay that the pope gave his swiss guards  so that

every walk that he took in the city cost him two or three crowns  and

even when surrounded by his twelve sbirri  he trembled at the thought of

meeting benvenuto cellini  for he knew that if the meeting should result

in an affray  and any mishap should befall the goldsmith  the pope  who

was really very fond of him  would make him  pompeo  pay dearly for it 

but  as we have said  clement vii  was dead  and his death restored some

little courage to pompeo 



benvenuto had been to st  peter s to kiss the feet of the deceased

pontiff  and was returning through the street dei banchi  accompanied by

pagolo and ascanio  when he found himself face to face with pompeo and

his twelve men  at the sight of his enemy  pompeo became very pale  but

as he looked around and saw how amply provided he was with defenders 

while benvenuto had only two boys with him  he took heart of grace 

halted  and nodded his head mockingly  while he toyed with the hilt of

his dagger with his right hand 



at sight of this group of men by whom his master was threatened  ascanio

put his hand to his sword  while pagolo pretended to be looking in

another direction  but benvenuto did not choose to expose his beloved

pupil to so unequal a conflict  he laid his hand upon ascanio s  pushing

the half drawn blade back into the scabbard  and walked on as if he had

seen nothing  or as if he had taken no offence at what he saw  ascanio

could hardly recognize his master in such guise  but as his master

withdrew  he withdrew with him 



pompeo triumphantly made a deep salutation to benvenuto  and pursued his

way  still surrounded by his sbirri  who imitated his bravado 



benvenuto bit his lips till the blood came  while externally his

features wore a smile  his behavior was inexplicable to any one who knew

the irascible nature of the illustrious goldsmith 



but they had not proceeded a hundred yards when he stopped before the

workshop of one of his confrères  and went in  alleging as a pretext

his desire to see an antique vase which had recently been found in the

etruscan tombs of corneto  he bade his pupils go on to the shop  and

promised to join them there in a few moments 



as the reader will understand  this was only a pretext to get ascanio

out of the way  for as soon as he thought that the young man and his

companion  concerning whom he was less anxious because he was sure that

such courage as he possessed would not carry him too far  had turned the

corner of the street  he replaced the vase upon the shelf from which he

took it  and darted out of the shop 



with three strides benvenuto was in the street where he had met pompeo 

but pompeo was no longer there  luckily  or rather unluckily  this man 

encompassed by his twelve sbirri  was a noticeable object  and so when

benvenuto inquired as to the direction he had taken  the first person to

whom he applied was able to give him the information  and like a

bloodhound that has recovered a lost scent benvenuto started in pursuit 



pompeo had stopped at a druggist s door  at the corner of the chiavica 

and was vaunting to the worthy compounder of drugs the prowess he had

shown in his meeting with benvenuto cellini  when his eye suddenly fell

upon the latter turning the corner of the street  with fire in his eye 

and the perspiration streaming down his forehead 



benvenuto shouted exultantly as he caught sight of him  and pompeo

stopped short in the middle of his sentence  it was evident that

something terrible was about to happen  the bravos formed a group around

pompeo and drew their swords 



it was an insane performance for one man to attack thirteen  but

benvenuto was  as we have said  one of those leonine creatures who do

not count their enemies  against the thirteen swords which threatened

him  he drew a small keen edged dagger which he always wore in his

girdle  and rushed into the centre of the group  sweeping aside two or

three swords with one arm  overturning two or three men with the other 

until he made his way to where pompeo stood  and seized him by the

collar  but the group at once closed upon him 



thereupon naught could be seen save a confused struggling mass  whence

issued loud shouts  and above which swords were waving  for a moment the

living mass rolled on the ground  in shapeless  inextricable confusion 

then a man sprang to his feet with a shout of triumph  and with a mighty

effort  forced his way out of the group as he made his way in  bleeding

himself  but triumphantly waving his blood stained dagger  it was

benvenuto cellini 



another man remained upon the pavement  writhing in the agony of death 

he had received two blows from the dagger  one below the ear  the other

at the base of the neck behind the collar bone  in a few seconds he

breathed his last   it was pompeo 



any other than benvenuto  after such a deed  would have taken himself

off at full speed  but he passed his dagger to his left hand  drew his

sword  and resolutely awaited the sbirri 



but the sbirri had no further business with benvenuto  he who paid them

was dead  and consequently could pay them no more  they ran off like a

flock of frightened rabbits  leaving pompeo s body where it lay 



at that juncture ascanio appeared  and rushed into his master s arms  he

was not deceived by the ruse of the etruscan vase  but although he had

made all possible speed he arrived a few seconds too late 









iii





dædalus





benvenuto returned to his abode with ascanio  somewhat ill at ease  not

because of the three wounds he had received  which were all too slight

to occasion him any anxiety  but because of the possible results of the

affray  six months before  he had killed guasconti  his brother s

murderer  but had come off scot free by virtue of the protection of pope

clement vii   moreover  that act was committed by way of reprisal  but

now benvenuto s protector had gone the way of all flesh  and the

prospect was much more ominous 



remorse  be it understood  did not disturb him for one moment  but we

beg our readers not for that reason to form an unfavorable opinion of

our worthy goldsmith  who after killing a man  after killing two men

perhaps   indeed  if we search his past very carefully  after killing

three men   although he had a wholesome dread of the watch  did not for

one instant fear to meet his god 



for this man  in the year of grace 1540  was an ordinary man  an

every day man  as the germans say  men thought so little of dying in

those days  that they naturally came to think very little of killing  we

are brave to day  but the men of those days were foolhardy  we are men

grown  they were hot headed youths  life was so abundant in those days

that men lost it  gave it  sold it  nay  even took it  with absolute

indifference and recklessness 



there was once an author who was calumniated and abused for many years 

whose name was made a synonym for treachery  cruelty  and all the words

which mean infamy  and it needed this nineteenth century  the most

impartial since the birth of humanity  to rehabilitate that author as

the grand patriot and noble hearted man he was  and yet nicolo

machiavelli s only crime was that he lived at an epoch when brute

strength and success were all in all  when folk judged by deeds  not

words  and when such men as cesar borgia the sovereign  machiavelli the

thinker  and benvenuto cellini the artisan  marched straight to their

goal  without thought of methods or reasons 



one day a body was found in the public square of cesena  cut in four

pieces  it was the body of ramiro d orco  now  as ramiro d orco was a

considerable personage in italy  the florentine republic sought to

ascertain the causes of his death  the eight of the signoria therefore

wrote to machiavelli  their ambassador at cesena  to satisfy their

curiosity 



but machiavelli made no other reply than this   





 magnificent signoria   i have naught to say anent the death of ramiro

d orco  save this  that no prince in the world is so skilful as cesar

borgia in the art of making and unmaking men according to their deserts 



 machiavelli  





benvenuto was an exponent of the theory enunciated by the illustrious

secretary of the florentine republic  benvenuto the genius  cesar borgia

the prince  both considered themselves above the laws by virtue of their

power  in their eyes the distinction between what was just and what was

unjust was identical with the distinction between what they could and

what they could not do  of right and duty they had not the slightest

conception  a man stood in their path  they suppressed the man  to day

civilization does him the honor of purchasing him 



but in those old days the blood was boiling so abundantly in the veins

of the young nations that they shed it for their health s sake 



they fought by instinct  not for their country to any great extent  not

for women to any great extent  but largely for the sake of fighting 

nation against nation  man against man  benvenuto made war upon pompeo

as françois i  did upon charles v  france and spain fought an

intermittent duel  now at marignano  and again at pavia  all as if it

were the most natural thing in the world  without preamble  without long

harangues  without lamentation 



in the same way genius was exercised by those who possessed it as an

innate faculty  as an absolute royal power  based upon divine right  art

in the sixteenth century was looked upon as the natural birthright of

man 



we must not therefore wonder at these men who wondered at nothing  we

have  to explain their homicides  their whims  and their faults  an

expression which explains and justifies everything in our country 

especially in these days of ours   



 that was the fashion  



benvenuto therefore did simply what it was the fashion to do  pompeo

annoyed benvenuto cellini  and benvenuto suppressed pompeo 



but the police occasionally investigated these acts of suppression  they

were very careful not to protect a man when he was alive  but perhaps

once in ten times they showed a feeble desire to avenge him when he was

dead 



they experienced such a desire in the matter of pompeo and benvenuto

cellini  as the goldsmith  having returned to his shop  was putting

certain papers in the fire  and some money in his pocket  he was

arrested by the pontifical sbirri  and taken to the castle of san

angelo   an occurrence for which he was almost consoled by the

reflection that the castle of san angelo was where noblemen were

imprisoned 



but another thought that was no less efficacious in bringing consolation

to cellini as he entered the castle was this   that a man endowed with

so inventive a mind as his need not long delay about leaving it  in one

way or another  and so  when he was taken before the governor  who was

sitting at a table covered with a green cloth  and looking through a

great pile of papers  he said   



 sir governor  multiply your locks and bolts and sentinels threefold 

confine me in your highest cell or in your deepest dungeon  keep close

watch upon me all day  and lie awake all night  and yet i warn you that 

despite all that  i will escape  



the governor looked up at the prisoner who addressed him with such

unheard of assurance  and recognized benvenuto cellini  whom he had had

the honor of entertaining three months before 



notwithstanding his acquaintance with the man  perhaps because of it 

benvenuto s allocution caused the worthy governor the most profound

dismay  he was a florentine  one master georgio  a knight of the

ugolini  and an excellent man  but somewhat weak in the head  however 

he soon recovered from his first surprise  and ordered benvenuto to be

taken to the highest cell in the castle  the platform was immediately

above it  a sentinel was stationed on the platform  and another sentinel

at the foot of the wall 



the governor called the prisoner s attention to these details  and when

he thought that he had had time to digest them  he said   



 my dear benvenuto  one may open locks  force doors  dig out from an

underground dungeon  make a hole through a wall  bribe sentinels and put

jailers to sleep  but without wings one cannot descend to earth from

this height  



 i will do it  nevertheless   said cellini 



the governor looked him in the eye  and began to think that his prisoner

was mad 



 why  in that case  you propose to fly  



 why not  i have always believed that man can fly  but i have lacked

time to make the experiment  here i shall have time enough  and 

pardieu  i mean to solve the problem  the adventure of dædalus is

history  not fable  



 beware the sun  dear benvenuto   sneeringly replied the governor 

 beware the sun  



 i will fly away by night   said benvenuto 



the governor was not expecting that reply  so that he had no suitable

repartee at hand  and withdrew in a rage 



in good sooth it was most important that benvenuto should make his

escape  at any price  at another time he would not have been at all

perturbed because he had killed a man  and would have been quit of all

responsibility by following the procession of the virgin in august  clad

in a doublet and cloak of blue armoisin  but the new pope  paul iii  

was vindictive to the last degree  and when he was still monsignore

farnese  benvenuto had had a crow to pluck with him  apropos of a vase

which the goldsmith refused to deliver until paid for  and which his

eminence sought to procure by force  the result being to subject

benvenuto to the dire necessity of using his eminence s retainers

somewhat roughly  moreover  the holy father was jealous because king

françois i  had commanded monseigneur de montluc  his ambassador to the

holy see  to request that benvenuto be sent to france  when he was

informed of benvenuto s imprisonment  monseigneur de montluc urged the

request more strenuously than before  thinking thereby to render the

unfortunate prisoner a service  but he was entirely unfamiliar with the

character of the new pope  who was even more obstinate than his

predecessor  clement vii  now paul iii  had sworn that benvenuto should

pay dearly for his escapade  and if he was not precisely in danger of

death   a pope would have thought twice in those days before ordering

such an artist to the gallows   he was in great danger of being

forgotten in his prison  it was therefore of the utmost importance that

benvenuto should not forget himself  and that was why he was determined

to take flight without awaiting the interrogatories and judgment  which

might never have arrived  for the pope  angered by the intervention of

françois i   refused even to hear benvenuto cellini s name mentioned 

the prisoner knew all this from ascanio  who was managing his

establishment  and who  by dint of persistent entreaties  had obtained

permission to visit his master  their interviews  of course  were held

through two iron gratings  and in presence of witnesses watching to see

that the pupil passed neither file  nor rope  nor knife to his master 



as soon as the door of his cell was locked behind the governor 

benvenuto set about inspecting his surroundings 



the following articles were contained within the four walls of his new

abiding place  a bed  a fireplace  a table  and two chairs  two days

after his installation there  he obtained a supply of clay and a

modelling tool  the governor at first declined to allow him to have

these means of distraction  but he changed his mind upon reflecting

that  if the artist s mind were thus employed  he might perhaps abandon

the idea of escape  to which he clung so tenaciously  the same day 

benvenuto sketched a colossal venus 



all this of itself was no great matter  but in conjunction with

imagination  patience  and energy  it was much 



on a certain very cold day in december  when the fire was lighted on the

hearth  the servant changed the sheets on his bed and left the soiled

ones upon a chair  as soon as the door was closed  benvenuto made one

bound from the chair on which he was sitting to the bed  took out of the

mattress two enormous handfuls of the maize leaves which are used to

stuff mattresses in italy  stowed the sheets away in their place 

returned to his statue  took up his tool and resumed his work  at that

moment the servant returned for the forgotten sheets  and after looking

everywhere for them  asked benvenuto if he had not seen them  but he

replied carelessly  as if absorbed by his work  that some of his fellows

doubtless had taken them  or that he carried them away himself without

knowing it  the servant had no suspicion of the truth  so little time

had elapsed since he left the room  and benvenuto played his part so

naturally  and as the sheets were never found  he was very careful to

say nothing  for fear of being obliged to pay for them or of losing his

employment 



one who has never lived through some supreme crisis can form no idea of

the possibilities of such a time in the way of terrible catastrophes and

poignant anguish  the most trivial accidents of life arouse in us joy or

despair  as soon as the servant left the room  benvenuto fell upon his

knees  and thanked god for the help he had sent him 



as his bed was never touched until the next morning after it was once

made  he quietly left the sheets in the mattress 



when the night came he began to cut the sheets  which luckily were new

and strong  in strips three or four inches wide  then tied them together

as securely as he could  lastly  he cut open his statue  which was of

clay  hollowed it out  placed his treasure in the cavity  then spread

clay over the wound  and smoothed it off with his finger and his

modelling tool  until the most skilful artist could not have discovered

that poor venus had been made to undergo the cæsarean operation 



the next morning the governor entered the prisoner s cell unexpectedly 

as he was accustomed to do  but found him as usual calm and hard at

work  every morning the poor man  who had been specially threatened for

the night  trembled lest he should find the cell empty  and it should be

said  in justice to his frankness  that he did not conceal his joy every

morning when he found it occupied 



 i confess that you make me terribly anxious  benvenuto   said the poor

man   however  i begin to think that your threats of escape amount to

nothing  



 i don t threaten you  master georgio   rejoined benvenuto   i warn

you  



 do you still hope to fly away  



 luckily it isn t a mere hope  but downright certainty  pardieu  



 demonio  how will you do it   cried the poor governor  dismayed beyond

measure by benvenuto s real or pretended confidence in his means of

escape 



 that s my secret  master  but i give you fair warning that my wings are

growing  



the governor instinctively turned his eye upon the prisoner s shoulders 



  t is thus   continued benvenuto  working away at his statue  and

rounding the hips in such fashion that one would have thought he

proposed to rival the venus callipyge   betwixt us there is a duel

impending  you have on your side enormous towers  thick doors  strong

bolts  innumerable keepers always on the alert  i have on my side my

brain  and these poor hands  and i warn you very frankly that you will

be beaten  but as you are a very clever man  as you have taken every

possible precaution  you will at least  when i am gone  have the

consolation of knowing that it is through no fault of yours  master

georgio  that you have no occasion to reproach yourself at all  master

georgio  and that you neglected nothing that could help you to detain

me  master georgio  and now what say you to this hip  for you are a

lover of art  i know  



such unblushing assurance enraged the unhappy official  his prisoner had

become his fixed idea  upon which all his faculties were centred  he

grew melancholy  lost his appetite  and started constantly  like one

suddenly aroused from sleep  one night benvenuto heard a great noise

upon the platform  then it was transferred to his corridor  and finally

stopped at his door  the door opened  and he saw master georgio  in

dressing gown and nightcap  attended by four jailers and eight guards 

the governor rushed to his bedside with distorted features  benvenuto

sat up in bed and laughed in his face  the governor  without taking

offence at his hilarity  breathed like a diver returning to the surface 



 ah  god be praised   he cried   he is still here  there s much good

sense in the saying   songe    mensonge    dream  lie  



 in god s name  what s the matter   demanded benvenuto   and what happy

circumstance affords me the pleasure of a visit from you at such an

hour  master georgio  



 jésus dieu  it s nothing at all  and i am quit of it this time for the

fright  did i not dream that your accursed wings had grown   huge wings 

whereon you tranquilly hovered above the castle of san angelo  saying 

 adieu  my dear governor  adieu  i did not wish to go away without

taking leave of you  i go  i pray that i may be so blessed as never to

see you more   



 what  did i say that to you  master georgio  



 those were your very words  ah  benvenuto  you are a sorry guest for

me  



 oh  i trust that you do not deem me so ill bred as that  happily it was

but a dream  for otherwise i would not forgive you  



 happily it is not true  i hold you fast  my dear friend  and although

truth compels me to say that your society is not of the most agreeable

to me  i hope to hold you for a long time yet to come  



 i do not think it   retorted benvenuto  with the confident smile which

caused his host to use strong language 



the governor went out  cursing benvenuto roundly  and the next morning

he issued orders that his cell should be inspected every two hours 

night and day  this rigid inspection was continued for a month  but at

the end of that time  as there was no apparent reason to believe that

benvenuto was even thinking of escape  the vigilance of his keepers was

somewhat relaxed 



benvenuto  however  had employed the month in accomplishing a terrible

task 



as we have said  he minutely examined his cell immediately after he was

first consigned to it  and from that moment his mind was made up as to

the manner of his escape  his window was barred  and the bars were too

strong to be removed with the hand or with his modelling tool  the only

iron instrument he possessed  the chimney narrowed so toward the top

that the prisoner must needs have had the fairy melusine s power of

transforming herself into a serpent to pass through it 



the door remained  ah  the door  let us see how the door was made 



it was a heavy oaken door two fingers thick  secured by two locks and

four bolts  and sheathed on the inside with iron plates kept in place by

nails at the top and bottom  it was through that door that the escape

must be effected 



benvenuto had noticed in the corridor  a few steps from the door  the

stairway leading to the platform  at intervals of two hours he heard the

footsteps of the relieving sentinel going up  then the steps of the

other coming down  after which he would hear nothing more for another

two hours 



the question for him to solve  then  was simply this  how to reach the

other side of that door  which was secured by two locks and four bolts 

and furthermore sheathed on the inside with iron plates kept in place by

nails at the top and bottom  the solution of this problem was the task

to which benvenuto had devoted the month in question 



with his modelling tool  which was of iron  he removed  one by one  the

heads of all the nails  save four above and four below  which he left

until the last day  then  in order that his work might not be detected 

he replaced the missing heads with exactly similar ones  modelled in

clay and covered with iron filings  so that it was impossible for the

keenest eye to distinguish the false from the true  as there were  at

top and bottom together  some sixty nails  and as it took at least one

hour  and sometimes two  to decapitate each nail  the magnitude of the

task may be understood 



every evening  when everybody had retired  and nothing could be heard

save the footsteps of the sentinel walking back and forth over his head 

he built a great fire on the hearth  and piled glowing embers against

the iron plates on his door  the iron became red hot  and gradually

transformed to charcoal the wood upon which it was applied  but no

indication of the carbonizing process appeared on the other side of the

door 



for a whole month benvenuto devoted himself to this task  as we have

said  but at the end of the month it was finished  and he only awaited a

favorable opportunity to make his escape  he was compelled  however  to

wait a few days  for the moon was near the full when the work was done 



there was nothing more to be done to the nails  so benvenuto continued

to char the door  and drive the governor to desperation  that very day

the functionary entered his cell more preoccupied than ever 



 my dear prisoner   said the worthy man  whose mind constantly recurred

to his fixed idea   do you still propose to fly away  come  tell me

frankly  



 more than ever  my dear host   replied benvenuto 



 look you   said the governor   you may say what you choose  but upon my

word  i believe it s impossible  



 impossible  master georgio  impossible   rejoined the artist   why  you

know full well that word does not exist for me  who have always

exerted myself to do those things which are the most impossible for

other men  and that with success  impossible  my dear host  why  have i

not sometimes amused myself by making nature jealous  by fashioning with

gold and emeralds and diamonds a flower fairer far than all the flowers

that the dew empearls  think you that he who can make flowers can not

make wings  



 may god help me   said the governor   with your insolent assurance

you ll make me lose my wits  but tell me  in order that these wings may

sustain your weight in the air   a thing which seems impossible to me  i

confess   what form shall you give them  



 i have thought deeply thereupon  as you may well imagine  since my

safety depends entirely upon the shape of my wings  



 with what result  



 after examining all flying things  i have concluded that  if i wish to

reproduce by art what they have received from god  i can copy the bat

most successfully  



 but when all is said  benvenuto   continued the governor   even if you

had the materials with which to make a pair of wings  would not your

courage fail you when the time came to use them  



 give me what i need for their construction  my dear governor  and i ll

reply by flying away  



 what do you need  in god s name  



 oh  mon dieu  almost nothing  a little forge  an anvil  files  tongs

and pincers to make the springs  and twenty yards of oiled silk for the

membranes 



 good  very good   said master georgio   that reassures me somewhat 

for  clever as you may be  you never will succeed in obtaining all those

things here  



  t is done   rejoined benvenuto 



the governor leaped from his chair  but he instantly reflected that it

was a material impossibility  and yet  for all that  his poor brain had

not a moment s respite  every bird that flew by his window he imagined

to be benvenuto cellini  so great is the influence of a master mind over

one of moderate capacity 



the same day master georgio sent for the most skilful machinist in all

rome  and ordered him to measure him for a pair of bat s wings 



the machinist stared at the governor in blank amazement  without

replying  thinking  with some reason  that master georgio had gone mad 



but as master georgio insisted  as master georgio was wealthy  and as

master georgio had the wherewithal to pay for insane freaks  if he chose

to indulge in them  the machinist set about the task  and a week later

brought him a pair of magnificent wings  fitted to an iron waist to be

worn upon the body  and worked by means of an extremely ingenious

arrangement of springs  with most encouraging regularity 



master georgio paid his man the stipulated price  measured the space

required to accommodate the apparatus  went up to benvenuto s cell  and

without a word overturned everything therein  looking under the bed 

peering up the chimney  fumbling in the mattress  and leaving not the

smallest corner unvisited 



then he went out  still without speaking  convinced that  unless

benvenuto was a sorcerer  no pair of wings similar to his own could be

hidden in his cell 



it was clear that the unhappy governor s brain was becoming more and

more disordered 



upon descending to his own quarters  master georgio found the machinist

waiting for him  he had returned to call his attention to the fact that

there was an iron ring at the end of each wing  intended to support the

legs of a man flying in a horizontal position 



the machinist had no sooner left him than master georgio locked himself

in  donned the iron waist  unfolded his wings  hung up his legs  and 

lying flat upon his stomach  made his first attempt at flying 



but  try as he would  he could not succeed in rising above the floor 



after two or three trials  always with the same result  he sent for the

mechanic once more 



 master   said he   i have tried your wings  but they won t work  



 how did you try them  



master georgio described his repeated experiments in detail  the

mechanic listened with a sober face  and said  when he had concluded   



 i am not surprised  as you lay on the floor  you hadn t a sufficient

quantity of air under your wings  you must go to the top of the castle

of san angelo  and boldly launch yourself into space  



 and you think that in that way i can fly  



 i am sure of it  



 if you are so sure of it  would it not be as well to make the

experiment yourself  



 the wings are proportioned to the weight of your body and not of mine  

replied the machinist   wings to carry my weight would need to measure a

foot and a half more from tip to tip  



and with that he bowed and took his leave 



 the devil   exclaimed master georgio 



throughout that day master georgio indulged in various vagaries  which

tended to prove that his reason  like roland s  was penetrating farther

and farther into imaginary realms 



in the evening  just at bedtime  he summoned all the servants  all the

jailers  all the guards 



 if   said he   you learn that benvenuto cellini is intending to fly

away  let him go  and notify me  nothing more  for i shall know where to

go to capture him  even in the dark  since i am myself a veritable bat 

while he  whatever he may say  is only a false bat  



the poor governor was quite mad  but as they hoped that a night s rest

would have a soothing effect upon him  they decided to wait until

morning before advising the pope 



moreover it was an abominable night  dark and rainy  and no one cared to

go out in such weather  always excepting benvenuto cellini  who had

selected that very night for his escape  in a spirit of contrariety

doubtless 



and so  as soon as he heard the clock strike ten  and the footsteps

indicating that the sentinel had been relieved  he fell on his knees and

offered a fervent prayer  after which he set to work 



in the first place he removed the heads of the four nails  which alone

held the iron plates in place  the last yielded to his efforts just at

midnight 



he heard the steps of the sentinel going up to the platform  he stood

with his ear glued to the door  without breathing  until the relieved

sentinel came down  the steps died away in the distance  and silence

reigned once more 



the rain fell with redoubled force  and benvenuto s heart leaped for joy

as he heard it heating against the window 



he at once tried to remove the iron plates  as there was nothing to hold

them  they yielded to his efforts  and he placed them  one by one 

against the wall 



he then lay flat upon the floor  and attacked the bottom of the door

with his modelling tool  sharpened like a dagger  and fitted to a wooden

handle  the oak was entirely changed to carbon  and gave way at the

first touch 



in an instant benvenuto had made  an aperture at the bottom of the door

sufficiently large to allow him to crawl through it  he reopened the

belly of his statue  took out the strips of linen  coiled them around

his waist like a girdle  armed himself with his modelling tool  of which

he had  as we have said  made a dagger  and fell on his knees once more

and prayed 



then he passed his head through the hole  then his shoulders  then the

rest of his body  and found himself in the corridor 



he stood erect  but his legs trembled so that he was compelled to lean

against the wall for support  his heart was beating as if it would

burst  and his head was on fire  a drop of perspiration trembled at the

end of each hair  and he clutched the handle of his dagger in his hand 

as if some one were trying to tear it away from him 



however  as everything was quiet  as nothing was stirring and not a

sound was to be heard  benvenuto soon recovered himself  and felt his

way along the wall of the corridor with his hand  until the wall came to

an end  then he put out his foot and felt the first step of the

staircase  or  more properly speaking  the ladder  which led to the

platform 



he mounted the rungs  one by one  shivering as the wood creaked under

his feet  until he felt a breath of air  then the rain beat against his

faee as his head rose above the level of the platform  and as he had

been in most intense darkness for a quarter of an hour  he was able to

judge at once what reason he had to fear or hope 



the balance seemed to incline toward hope 



the sentinel had taken refuge from the storm in his sentry box  how  as

the sentinels who mounted guard upon the castle of san angelo were

stationed there  not to inspect the platform  but to look down into the

moat and survey the surrounding country  the closed side of the

sentry box faced the top of the ladder by which benvenuto ascended 



the artist crept cautiously on his hands and knees toward that part of

the platform which was farthest removed from the sentry box  there he

securely fastened one end of his improvised rope to a jutting projection

some six inches in length  and then knelt for the third time 



 o lord   he muttered   o lord  do thou help me  since i am seeking to

help myself  



with that prayer upon his lips  he let himself down by his hands 

heedless of the bruises upon his knees and his forehead  which  from

time to time  rubbed against the face of the wall  and at last reached

the solid earth 



when he felt the ground beneath his feet  his breast swelled with an

infinitude of joy and pride  he contemplated the immense height from

which he had descended  and could not avoid saying in an undertone 

 free at last   but his joy was short lived 



as he turned away from the tower  his knees trembled under him  directly

in front of him rose a wall recently built  and of which he knew

nothing  he was lost 



everything seemed to give way within him  and in his despair he fell to

the ground  but as he fell  his foot struck against something hard   it

was a long beam  he gave a slight exclamation of surprise and delight 

he was saved 



ah  no one knows what heart rending alternations of joy and hope one

short minute of life can contain 



benvenuto seized the beam as a shipwrecked sailor seizes the spar which

may save him from drowning  under ordinary circumstances two strong men

would have found difficulty in lifting it  he dragged it to the wall 

and stood it on end against it  then he climbed to the top of the wall 

clinging to the beam with his hands and knees  but when he arrived there

his strength was insufficient to raise the beam and lower it on the

other side 



for a moment his head swam  he closed his eyes  and it seemed as if he

were struggling in a lake of flames 



suddenly he remembered his strips of linen  by means of which he had

descended from the platform 



he slid down the beam to the ground once more  and ran to the spot where

he had left them hanging  but he had fastened them so securely at the

opposite end  that he could not detach them  in his desperation he

raised himself from the ground by hanging to them  pulling with all his

strength  and hoping to break them  fortunately one of the knots slipped

at last  and benvenuto fell to the ground  grasping a fragment some

twelve feet long 



this was all that he needed  he rose with a bound  and  filled with

fresh vigor  climbed up to the top of the wall once more  fastened the

cord to the end of the beam  and slid down on the other side 



when he reached the end of the cord he felt in vain for the ground with

his feet  and  upon looking over his shoulder  saw that it was still

some six feet away  he let go the cord  and dropped 



he lay still for an instant  he was completely exhausted  and there was

no skin left upon his legs and hands  for some moments he gazed stupidly

at his bleeding flesh  but five o clock struck  and he saw that the

stars were beginning to pale 



he rose  but as he rose  a sentinel whom he had not noticed  but who had

undoubtedly witnessed his performance  walked toward him  benvenuto saw

that he was lost  and that he must either kill or be killed  he drew his

modelling tool from his belt  and marched straight toward the guard 

with such a determined expression that worthy doubtless realized

that he had not only a powerful man  but a deathly despair  to contend

with  benvenuto was determined not to give ground  but suddenly the

soldier turned his back upon him as if he had not seen him  the prisoner

understood what that meant 



he ran to the last rampart  and found himself some twelve or fifteen

feet above the moat  such a trifle was not likely to stop a man like

benvenuto cellini  in his present predicament  when he had left part of

his cord hanging from the top of the tower  and the other part attached

to the beam  so that he had nothing left with which to lower himself 

and there was no time to lose  he hung by his hands from a ring in the

masonry  and  with a mental prayer  let himself drop 



this time he fainted outright 



an hour passed before he came to himself  but the coolness which is

always noticeable in the air as dawn approaches  revived him  he lay for

an instant with his mind in confusion  then passed his hand over his

forehead and remembered everything 



he felt a sharp pain in his head  and saw blood upon the stones where he

lay  which had trickled down from his face  he put his hand to his

forehead a second time  not to collect his thoughts  but to investigate

his wounds  which he found were but skin deep  he smiled and tried to

stand up  but fell heavily back  his right leg was broken three inches

above the ankle  the leg was so benumbed that at first he felt no pain 



he at once removed his shirt and tore it into strips  then put the ends

of the bone together as well as he could  and applied the bandage 

binding it with all his strength  and passing it under the sole of his

foot now and then  in order to keep the bones in place 



then he dragged himself on all fours toward one of the city gates which

was within five hundred yards  after half an hour of atrocious

suffering  he reached the gate only to find that it was closed  but he

noticed a large stone under the gate  which yielded to his first attempt

to remove it  and he passed through the hole left by it 



he had not taken twenty steps beyond the gate when he was attacked by a

pack of famished dogs  who were attracted by the odor of blood  he drew

his modelling tool  and despatched the largest and most savage with a

blow in the side  the others immediately threw themselves upon their

defunct comrade and devoured him 



benvenuto dragged himself along to the church of la transpontina  where

he fell in with a water carrier who had just filled his jars and loaded

his donkey  he called him 



 look you   he said   i was with my mistress  circumstances compelled

me  although i went in at the door  to come out through the window  i

leaped from the first floor  and broke my leg  carry me to the steps of

saint peter s  and i will give you a golden crown  



the water carrier  without a word  took the wounded man on his shoulder 

and carried him to the designated spot  having received his pay  he went

his way without so much as looking behind 



thereupon benvenuto  still on all fours  made his way to the palace of

monseigneur de montluc  the french ambassador  who lived only a few

steps away 



monseigneur de montluc exerted himself so zealously in his behalf  that

at the end of a month benvenuto was cured  at the end of two months he

was pardoned  and at the end of four months he started for france with

ascanio and pagolo 



the poor governor  who had gone mad  lived and died a madman  constantly

imagining that he was a bat  and making the most violent efforts to fly 









iv





scozzone





when benvenuto cellini arrived in france  françois i  was at the

château of fontainebleau with his whole court  the artist stopped in

the town  sending word of his arrival to the cardinal of ferrara  the

cardinal  who knew that the king was impatiently awaiting his coming  at

once transmitted the intelligence to his majesty  benvenuto was received

by the king the same day 



 benvenuto   he said  addressing him in that mellifluous and expressive

tongue in which the artist wrote so well   for a few days  while you are

recovering from your fatigue and vexation  repose  enjoy yourself  make

merry  and meanwhile we will reflect and determine upon some noble work

for you to execute  



thereupon he ordered apartments in the château to be made ready for the

artist  and that he should want for nothing 



thus benvenuto found himself at the outset installed in the very centre

of french civilization  at that time behind that of italy  with which it

was already struggling for supremacy  and which it was soon to surpass 

as he looked around  he could easily believe that he had never left the

tuscan capital  for he found himself in the midst of the arts and

artists he had known at florence  primaticcio had succeeded leonardo da

vinci and rosso 



it was for benvenuto  therefore  to show himself not unworthy of these

illustrious predecessors  and to carry the art of statuary as high in

the eyes of the most gallant court of europe as those three great

masters had carried the art of painting  and so benvenuto determined to

anticipate the king s wishes by not waiting for him to command the noble

work promised  and to execute it himself  of his own motion  and with

his own resources  he had readily discovered the king s affection for

the royal residence where he had met him  and determined to flatter his

preference by executing a statue to be called the  nymph of

fontainebleau  



a lovely work to undertake was this statue  crowned at once with oak and

wheat ears and vines  for fontainebleau is partly field  partly forest 

and partly vineyard  the nymph of whom benvenuto dreamed must therefore

be reminiscent of ceres and diana and erigone   three types of

marvellous beauty melted into one  and which  while retaining their

distinctive characteristics  should still form but a single whole  then

there should be represented upon the pedestal the attributes of those

three goddesses  and they who have seen the fascinating figures about

the statue of perseus know the florentine master s method of executing

those marvellous details 



but it was his misfortune that  although he had in his own mind his

ideal of beauty  he was sadly in need of a human model for the material

part of his work  where was he to find this model  in whose single

person could be found the threefold beauty of three goddesses 



certain it is  that if  as in the olden days  the days of apelles and

phidias  the beauties of the day  those queens of loveliness  had come

of their own accord to pose for benvenuto  he would have found what he

sought within the precincts of the court  for there was a whole olympus

in the flower of youth and beauty  there were catherine de medicis  then

but one and twenty  marguerite de valois  queen of navarre  who was

called the fourth grace and the tenth muse  and lastly  madame la

duchesse d etampes  whom we shall meet frequently in the course of this

narrative  and who was known as the loveliest of blue stockings and the

most learned of beauties  in this galaxy the artist could have found

more than he needed  but the days of apelles and phidias had long gone

by  and he must look elsewhere 



it was with great pleasure  therefore  that he learned that the court

was about to set out for paris  unfortunately  as benvenuto himself

says  the court in those days travelled like a funeral procession 

preceded by twelve to fifteen thousand horse  halting for the night in

some place where there were no more than two or three houses  wasting

four hours every evening in pitching the tents  and four hours every

morning in striking them   in this way  although the distance was but

sixteen leagues  five days were spent in the journey from fontainebleau

to paris 



twenty times on the way benvenuto was tempted to push forward  but as

often the cardinal of ferrara dissuaded him  saying that  if the king

was compelled to pass a single day without seeing him  he would

certainly ask what had become of him  and when he learned that he had

left the procession would look upon his unceremonious departure as a

failure of respect toward himself  so benvenuto chafed at his bit  and

tried to kill time during the long halt by sketching his nymph of

fontainebleau 



at last he arrived at paris  his first visit was to primaticcio  who was

commissioned to continue the work of leonardo da vinci and rosso at

fontainebleau  primaticcio  who had lived long at paris  should be able

at once to put him upon the path he was seeking  and to tell him where

to look for models 



a word  in passing  as to primaticcio 



il signor francesco primaticcio  who was commonly called at this time le

bologna  from his birthplace  had studied under jules romain for six

years  and had lived eight years in france  whither françois i  had

summoned him upon the advice of the marquis of mantua  his great

purveyor of artists  he was  as any one may see at fontainebleau  a man

of prodigious fecundity  with a broad  florid manner  and irreproachable

regularity of outline  for a long time primaticcio  with his

encyclopedic brain  his vast store of knowledge  and his boundless

talent  which embraced all varieties of painting   for a long time  we

say  he was despised  but in our day he has been avenged for three

centuries of injustice  under the inspiration of religious ardor  he

painted the pictures in the chapel of beauregard  in moral subjects he

personified the principal christian virtues at the hôtel montmorency 

and the immensity of fontainebleau was filled to overflowing with his

works  at the golden gate and in the salle du bal he treated the most

graceful subjects of mythology and allegory  in the gallery of ulysses

and the chamber of saint louis he was an epic poet with homer  and

translated with his brush the odyssey and a portion of the iliad  then

he passed from the age of fable to heroic times  and historical subjects

became his study  the principal incidents in the life of alexander and

romulus  and the surrender of havre  were reproduced in the painting

with which he decorated the grand gallery and the apartment adjoining

the salle du bal  he turned his attention to the beauties of nature in

the great landscapes of the cabinet of curiosities  in short  if we care

to take the measurement of his eminent talent  to consider the various

forms in which it found expression  and to reckon up its work  we shall

find that in ninety eight large pictures and a hundred and thirty

smaller ones he has treated  one after another  landscapes  marine

views  historical  allegorical  and religious subjects  portraits  and

the themes of epic poetry 



he was  as may be seen  a man likely to appreciate benvenuto  and so  as

soon as benvenuto arrived at paris  he ran to primaticcio with open

arms  and was welcomed by him in the same temper 



after the first serious conversation between the two friends meeting

thus in a foreign land  benvenuto opened his portfolio  imparted all his

ideas to primaticcio  showed him all his sketches  and asked him if

there was any one of the models he was accustomed to use who fulfilled

the necessary conditions 



primaticcio shook his head  smiling sadly  in truth  they were no longer

in italy  the daughter of greece and rival of her mother  france was in

those days  as it is to day  the land of grace  and prettiness  and

coquetry  but in vain would one have sought in the domain of the valois

that imperious loveliness which inspired the genius of michel angelo and

raphael  of john of bologna and andrea del sarto  on the banks of the

tiber and the arno  to be sure  if the painter or sculptor had been at

liberty to choose a model at will among the aristocracy  he would soon

have found the types he sought  but like those shades which are detained

on this side of the styx  he was perforce content to see those noble 

lovely forms  the constant objects of his artistic aspirations  pass

over into the elysian fields which he was forbidden to enter 



it turned out as primaticcio anticipated  benvenuto passed in review his

whole army of models  and saw not one who seemed to combine all the

qualities essential for the work of which he was dreaming 



thereupon he caused all the venuses at a crown the sitting whose names

were furnished him to be summoned to the cardinal of ferrara s palace 

where he was installed  but none of them fulfilled his expectations 



benvenuto was almost at his wit s end when  one evening  as he was

returning home alone along rue des petits champs  after supping with

three compatriots whom he had met at paris   namely  pietro strozzi  the

count of anguillara  his brother in law  and galeotto pico  nephew of

the famous pico della mirandole   he noticed a graceful  lovely girl

walking in front of him  benvenuto fairly leaped for joy  the girl was 

of all whom he had thus far seen  by far the best qualified to give

shape to his dream  he followed her  therefore  she walked along by the

church of saint honoré  and turned into rue du pelican  there she

looked around to see if she was still followed  and  seeing benvenuto

within a few steps  hastily opened a door and disappeared  benvenuto

went to the same door and opened it in time to see the skirt of the

young woman s dress disappear at a bend in the stairway  which was

lighted by a smoking lamp 



he went up to the first floor  a chamber door stood ajar  and in the

chamber he discovered the girl he had followed 



without explaining the artistic motive of his intrusion  indeed  without

saying a word  benvenuto  desirous to ascertain whether the outlines of

her body corresponded with those of her face  walked around and around

the poor  bewildered girl  as he might have done had she been a statue 

taking her arms and raising them above her head in the attitude which he

proposed that his nymph of fontainebleau should assume  and she obeyed

his gestures mechanically 



there was little of ceres in the model now before his eyes  and still

less of diana  but very much of erigone  the master thereupon made up

his mind  in view of the manifest impossibility of finding the three

types united in one person  to be satisfied with the bacchante  but for

the bacchante he had certainly found all that he desired   sparkling

eyes  coral lips  teeth like pearls  graceful neck  well rounded

shoulders  and broad hips  and in the slender wrists and ankles  and the

long nails  there was a suggestion of aristocratic blood  which removed

the artist s last hesitation 



 what is your name  mademoiselle   benvenuto  with his foreign accent 

at last asked the poor girl  whose wonder momentarily increased 



 catherine  monsieur  at your service   she replied 



 very good  here is a golden crown  mademoiselle catherine  for the

trouble i have caused you  come to me to morrow at the cardinal of

ferrara s hotel on rue saint martin  and i will give you as much more

for the same service  



the girl hesitated an instant  thinking that he was making sport of her 

but the gold crown seemed to prove that he was speaking seriously  and

after a very brief pause  she said   



 at what time  



 ten o clock in the morning  does that suit your convenience  



 perfectly  



 so that i may rely upon you  



 i will come  



benvenuto saluted her as he would have saluted a duchess  and returned

home with a glad heart  he at once burned all his idealistic sketches 

and set to work upon one based upon flesh and blood  having completed

the drawing  he placed a quantity of wax upon a pedestal  and beneath

his dexterous touch it instantly assumed the shape of the nymph of whom

he had dreamed  so that when catherine appeared at the door of his

studio the next morning  a part of his task was already done 



as we have said  catherine utterly failed to understand benvenuto s

motives  she was vastly astonished  therefore  when  having closed the

door behind her  he showed her the statue already begun  and explained

why he had asked her to come 



catherine was a light hearted  joyous creature  and laughed heartily at

her mistake  her bosom swelled with pride at the thought of posing as a

model for a goddess to be presented to a king  so she removed her

clothing  and of her own motion assumed the pose indicated by the

statue   so gracefully  and withal so exactly  that the artist  when he

turned and saw her posed so naturally and well  exclaimed in delight 



benvenuto at once set to work  his was  as we have said  one of those

noble  vigorous  artistic natures in which inspiration is aroused by the

work beneath their hands  and which seem to become illumined as their

work proceeds  he had thrown aside his doublet  and as he went back and

forth from the model to the copy  from nature to art  he seemed  with

his bare neck and arms  like jupiter  ready to kindle everything that he

touched into flame  catherine  accustomed to the commonplace or worn out

organization of the young men of the lower classes with whom she had

associated  or the young noblemen whose plaything she had been  gazed at

this man with the inspired glance  quickened respiration  and swelling

breast  with an unfamiliar sensation of wonder  she seemed herself to

rise to the master s level  her eyes shone  and the artist s inspiration

was communicated to the model 



the sitting lasted two hours  at the end of that time benvenuto gave

catherine her gold crown  and took leave of her as ceremoniously as

before  making an appointment for the following day at the same hour 



catherine returned to her own room  and did not go out during the day 

the next morning she was at the studio ten minutes before the appointed

time 



the same scene was repeated  on that day  as on the day before 

benvenuto s inspiration rose to sublime heights  beneath his hand  as

beneath that of prometheus  the clay seemed to breathe  the bacchante s

head was already modelled  and seemed a living head set upon a shapeless

trunk  catherine smiled upon this celestial sister  fashioned in her

image  she had never been so happy  and  strangely enough  she was

unable to explain the sentiment which caused her happiness 



on the following day the master and the model met again at the same

hour  but catherine was conscious of a sensation  absent on the

preceding days  which caused the blood to rush to her face as soon as

she began to disrobe  the poor child was beginning to love  and love

brought modesty in its train 



on the fourth day it was still worse  and benvenuto was compelled

several times to remind her that he was not modelling the venus de

medicis  but erigone  drunken with debauchery and wine  moreover  her

patience would be tried but a little longer  two days more  and the

model s services would be no longer required 



in the afternoon of the second day  benvenuto  having given the last

touch to his statue  thanked catherine for her complaisance  and gave

her four gold crowns  but catherine let them fall to the floor  the poor

child s dream was ended  from that moment she must return to her former

condition  and that condition had become hateful to her since the day

that she entered the master s studio  benvenuto  who had no suspicion of

what was taking place in the girl s heart  picked up the four crowns 

handed them to her once more  pressing her hand as he did so  and said

to her that  if he ever could be of service to her  she must apply to no

one but him  then he passed into the apartment where his apprentices

were at work  seeking ascanio  to whom he wished to exhibit his

completed statue 



catherine kissed the tools the master had used  one after another  and

went away  weeping 



the next morning catherine appeared at the studio while benvenuto was

alone  and when he  astonished to see her again  asked her why she had

come  she knelt at his feet and asked him if he did not need a servant 



benvenuto had an artist s heart  quick to detect feeling in another  he

divined what was taking place in the poor child s heart  and raised her

from the floor  kissing her upon the forehead as he did so 



from that moment catherine was a part of the studio  which  as we have

said  she brightened and made cheerful with her childish ways  and

enlivened by her unceasing activity  she had become almost indispensable

to everybody  above all to benvenuto  she it was who superintended and

managed everything  scolding and caressing ruperta  who was dismayed at

her first appearance in the household  but ended by loving her as

everybody else did 



the erigone lost nothing by this arrangement  having the model always at

hand  benvenuto had retouched and perfected it with greater care than he

had ever before bestowed upon one of his statues  and had then carried

it to françois i   whose admiration knew no bounds  and who ordered him

to execute it in silver  he subsequently conversed for a long time with

the goldsmith  asked him if he was pleased with his studio  where it was

situated  and whether there were beautiful things to be seen there  and

when he dismissed him  he determined in his own mind to take him by

surprise some morning  but said nothing to him of his intention 



thus did matters stand when this history opens   benvenuto working 

catherine singing  ascanio dreaming  and pagolo praying 



on the day following that on which ascanio returned home so late  thanks

to his excursion in the neighborhood of the hôtel de nesle  there was a

loud knocking at the street door  dame ruperta at once rose to answer

the summons  but scozzone  the reader will remember that this was the

name given to catherine by benvenuto  was already out of the room 



a moment later they heard her voice  half joyous  half terrified 

crying   



 o mon dieu  master  mon dieu  it is the king  the king in person has

come to see your studio  



and poor scozzone  leaving all the doors open behind her  reappeared 

pale and trembling  on the threshold of the workshop  where benvenuto

was at work  surrounded by his pupils and apprentices 









v





genius and royalty





in very truth  françois i  was entering the courtyard with all his

retinue  he led by the hand the duchesse d etampes  the king of navarre

followed with the dauphine  catherine de medicis  the dauphin 

afterwards henri ii   came next  with his aunt  marguerite de valois 

queen of navarre  almost all the nobility accompanied them 



benvenuto went to meet them  without confusion or embarrassment  and

welcomed the king  princes  great lords  and beautiful women as a friend

welcomes friends  and yet there were in the throng the most illustrious

names of france  and the most resplendent beauties in the world 

marguerite charmed  madame d etampes entranced  catherine de medicis

astonished  diane de poitiers dazzled  but benvenuto was familiar with

the purest types of antiquity and of the sixteenth century in italy 

even as the beloved pupil of michel angelo was accustomed to the society

of kings 



 you must needs permit us  madame  to admire by your side the marvels we

are to behold   said françois i  to the duchesse d etampes  who replied

with a smile 



anne de pisseleu  duchesse d etampes  who since the king s return from

his captivity in spain had succeeded the comtesse de châteaubriand in

his favor  was at this time in all the splendor of a truly royal

loveliness  her figure was erect and graceful  and she carried her

charming head with a dignity and feline grace which recalled at once the

cat and panther  which she also resembled in her habit of pouncing upon

one unexpectedly  and in her murderous appetites  with all this the

royal courtesan was very clever at assuming an air of sincerity and

candor which would disarm the most suspicious  nothing could be more

mobile or more treacherous than the features of this pale lipped woman 

to day hermione  to morrow galatea  with her smile  sometimes cajoling 

sometimes terrible   her glance  at one moment caressing and suggestive 

and the next flaming with wrath  she had a habit of raising her eyelids

so slowly that one could never tell whether they would disclose a

languorous or a threatening expression  haughty and imperious  she

subjugated françois i  by holding his passions enthralled  proud and

jealous  she insisted that he should call upon the comtesse de

châteaubriand to return the jewels he had given her  by returning them

in the form of bullion  the lovely and melancholy countess did at least

protest against the profanation  supple and deceitful  she had closed

her eyes more than once when the king s capricious fancy seemed to

distinguish some charming young woman at court  whom  however  he

invariably abandoned very soon to return to his beautiful enchantress 



 i was in haste to see you  benvenuto  for two months have now passed

since your coming to our realm  and vexatious affairs of state have

since that time forbade my turning my thoughts to things artistic 

impute it to my brother and cousin  the emperor  who gives me not a

moment of repose  





 illustration 03 





 if it is your will  sire  i will write to him  and pray that he will

give you time to be a great friend to art  since you have proved to him

ere this that you are a mighty captain  



 pray  do you know charles v    inquired the king of navarre 



 four years since  sire  i had the honor  being then at rome  to present

a missal of my making to his sacred majesty  and make a speech to him

which seemed to touch him nearly  



 what said his sacred majesty to you  



 he said that he already knew me from having seen upon the pope s cope 

three years before  a carved stud  which did me honor  



 ah  i see that you are spoiled for royal compliments   said françois

i 



 sire   t is true that i have had the fortune to please many cardinals 

grand dukes  princes  and kings  



 prithee  show me your beautiful designs  that i may see if i shall not

be a harder judge to please than others  



 sire  i have had very little time  however  here are a vase and silver

basin which i have commenced  and which are perhaps not too unworthy of

your majesty s attention  



the king examined the two works of art for five minutes without a word 

it seemed that the handiwork made him forget the workman  at last  as

the ladies gathered curiously about him  he spoke 



 see  mesdames   he cried   what marvellous workmanship  observe the

hold and novel shape of this vase  what ingenuity and marvellous

modelling in the bas reliefs and bosses  mon dieu  especially do i

admire the beauty of the lines  and see how true to life and how diverse

are the attitudes of the figures  look at the one holding her arms over

her head  the fugitive gesture is so naturally seized that one wonders

that she doesn t continue the movement  in very truth  i believe that

the ancients never did anything so fine  i remember the best works of

antiquity  and those of the most eminent artists of italy  but nothing

ever made so deep an impression upon me as this  o madame de navarre  i

pray you look at this pretty child lost among the flowers  and waving

her little foot in the air  how graceful and pretty and instinct with

life it all is  



 others have complimented me  great king   cried benvenuto   but you

understand me  



 have you aught else   asked the king  greedily 



 here is a medallion representing leda and her swan  made for cardinal

gabriel cesarini  and here a seal cut in intaglio  representing saint

john and saint ambrose  this is a reliquary  enamelled by myself   



 do you strike medals   interposed madame d etampes 



 as cavadone of milan did  madame  



 and you work in enamel   said marguerite 



 like amerigo of florence  



 and you engrave seals   inquired catherine 



 like lantizco of perouse  pray  did you think  madame  that my talent

is confined to the production of tiny golden toys and great silver

pieces  i can do a little of everything  god be praised  i am a passable

military engineer  and i have twice prevented the capture of rome  i can

turn a sonnet prettily  and your majesty has but to order me to compose

a poem  provided that it be in praise of yourself  and i will undertake

to execute it neither better nor worse than if my name were clement

marot  as to music  which my father taught me with a stick  i found the

method an admirable one  and i am so good a performer on the flute and

cornet that clement vii  employed me among his musicians at the age of

twenty four  furthermore  i discovered the secret of compounding an

excellent powder  and i can also make beautiful carbines and surgical

instruments  if your majesty is at war  and chooses to employ me as

man at arms  you will find that i am not to be despised in that

capacity  and that i know as well how to handle an arquebus as to sight

a culverin  as a hunter i have brought down my twenty five peacocks in a

day  and as an artillerist i have freed the emperor from the prince of

orange  and your majesty from the connétable de bourbon  traitors seem

not to be fortunate when they encounter me  



 of which exploit are you the prouder   the young dauphin interrupted 

 of having killed the constable or the twenty five peacocks  



 i am proud of neither  monseigneur  like all other gifts  address is

god given  and i simply used my address  



 by my faith  i was ignorant that you had already rendered me so great a

service   said the king    a service which  however  my sister

marguerite will be at great pains to pardon you  was it indeed you who

slew the connétable de bourbon  prithee  how came it to pass  



 mon dieu  it was the simplest thing in the world  the constable s army

had arrived unexpectedly before rome  and a vigorous assault upon the

fortifications was in progress  i sallied forth  with a few friends  to

watch the fighting  as i left my house  i instinctively put my arquebus

over my shoulder  when we reached the walls of the city  i saw that

there was nothing to be done  but  i said to myself  it shall not be

said that i came hither to so little purpose  so i aimed my arquebus

toward the point where i saw a numerous and compact group of soldiers 

and singled out one who stood a head taller than his companions  he

fell  and a great uproar at once arose  caused by the shot i had fired 

i had  in truth  slain bourbon  i learned afterward that it was he who

towered above his companions  



while benvenuto was relating this incident with a most indifferent air 

the circle of lords and ladies of which he was the centre spread out

somewhat  and they all gazed with respect  and almost with terror  at

this unconscious hero  françois i  alone remained at his side 



 and so  my dear fellow   he said   i see that you loaned me your

gallantry before consecrating your genius to me  



 sire   benvenuto rejoined with a smile   i believe  in good sooth  that

i was born to be your servitor  an incident of my early youth has always

seemed to me to admit of no other interpretation  your crest is a

salamander  is it not  



 yes  with this device   nutrisco et extinguo   



 very well  when i was about five years old  i was sitting one day with

my father in a small room where they had been scalding the lye  and

where a rousing fire of young oak was still burning  it was very cold 

happening to glance at the fire  i espied a tiny creature like a lizard

diverting itself in the spot where the heat was most intense  i pointed

it out to my father  and my father  pray pardon me this detail of a

somewhat brutal custom of my country  struck me a violent blow  and said

to me  with great gentleness   i do not strike thee because thou hast

done wrong  dear child  but so that thou mayst remember that the little

lizard thou hast seen in the fire is a salamander  no human being has

ever seen that animal save thou   was not that a premonition of fate 

sire  indeed  i think i was predestined to do as i have done  for at the

age of twenty i was about to set out for england  when the sculptor

pietro torregiano  who was to take me thither  told me that in his youth

he one day struck our michel angelo in the face  on the occasion of some

studio quarrel  ah  i abandoned all thought of the journey then  not for

a prince s title would i have travelled with one who had raised his hand

against my great sculptor  i remained in italy  and from italy  instead

of going to england  i came to france  



 france  proud of your choice  benvenuto  will see to it that you do not

sigh for your fatherland  



 oh  my fatherland is art  and my prince he who commands the richest cup

at my hands  



 have you any beautiful work now in contemplation  cellini  



 o yes  sire   a christ  not a christ upon the cross  but christ in his

radiance and glory  and i shall copy as closely as possible the infinite

beauty of the guise in which he revealed himself to me  



 what   laughed marguerite  the sceptic   in addition to all the kings

of earth  have you seen the king of heaven  too  



 yes  madame   replied benvenuto  with childlike simplicity 



 oh  pray tell us of that   said the queen of navarre 



 willingly  madame   said benvenuto  with a confident air  which implied

that it did not occur to him that any one could doubt any part of his

story 



 some time before   he continued   i had seen satan and all his legions 

whom a necromancing friend of mine  a priest  evoked for me at the

coliseum  indeed  we had much ado to rid ourselves of them  but the

dread souvenir of those infernal apparitions was forever banished from

my mind when  in answer to my fervent prayer  the blessed saviour of

mankind appeared to me  in a flood of sunlight  crowned with glory  and

brought sweet consolation to me in the misery of my captivity  



 and are you sure beyond a peradventure   demanded the queen of navarre 

 so sure that you have no shadow of doubt  that christ really appeared

to you  



 i have no doubt of it  madame  



 in that case  benvenuto  go on and fashion a christ for our chapel  

said françois i   with his usual good humor 



 sire  if your majesty will so far indulge me  i pray you to order

something different  and allow me to postpone the execution of that

work  



 why so  



 because i promised god to undertake it for no other sovereign than

him  



  à la bonne heure   be it so  benvenuto  i need twelve candlesticks

for my table  



 ah  that is a different matter  and therein  sire  you shall be obeyed  



 it is my wish that they should take the form  of twelve silver

statues  



 the effect will be magnificent  sire  



 they must represent six gods and six goddesses  and be of my own

height  



 why  your order is for a whole epic poem   said the duchesse d etampes 

 for a work of marvellous  surprising splendor  is it not  monsieur

benvenuto  



 i am never surprised  madame  



 i should be greatly surprised  my self   retorted the duchess  somewhat

piqued   if other sculptors than those of the olden time could carry

such a task to completion  



 i hope  nevertheless  to execute it as satisfactorily as they could

have done   rejoined benvenuto  coolly 



 oho  are you not inclined to boast a little  monsieur benvenuto  



 i never boast  madame  



as he made this reply with perfect calmness  cellini looked at madame

d etampes  and the haughty duchess lowered her eyes  in spite of

herself  under that firm  assured glance  in which there was no trace of

irritation  her resentment was aroused by the consciousness of his

superiority  to which she yielded even while resisting it  and without

knowing in what it consisted  she had thought hitherto that beauty was

the greatest power in the world  she had forgotten genius 



 what treasure   said she  with a bitter sneer   would suffice to

recompense such talent as yours  



 none that i can command  i  faith   rejoined françois i    and

apropos  benvenuto  i remember that you have as yet received but five

hundred crowns  will you be content with the stipend which i allowed my

painter  leonardo da vinci  seven hundred gold crowns yearly  i will pay

over and above that for all works which you may execute for me  



 sire  your offer is worthy such a king as françois i   and  i venture

to say it  of such an artist as cellini  and yet i shall make so bold as

to prefer a request to your majesty  



 it is granted in advance  benvenuto  



 sire  i am but ill and narrowly accommodated in this edifice  one of my

pupils has discovered a location much more favorably situated than this

for the execution of such great works as my king may choose to command 

the property in question belongs to your majesty  it is the grand nesle 

it is at the disposal of the provost of paris  but he does not dwell

therein  he occupies only the petit nesle  which i will gladly leave in

his possession  



 so be it  benvenuto   said françois   take up your abode at the

grand nesle  and i shall have only to cross the river to talk with you

and admire your masterpieces  



 consider  sire   interposed madame d etampes   that you thereby  for no

motive  deprive a nobleman  and one devoted to my service  of property

appertaining to his office  



benvenuto glanced at her  and for the second time anne lowered her eyes

beneath that steady  piercing gaze  cellini rejoined  with the same

naïve good faith with which he had described the supernatural

apparitions   



 i  too  am of noble birth  madame  my family descends from a gallant

officer  who held high rank under julius cæsar   one fiorino  of

cellino  near montefiascone   and who gave his name to florence  while

your provost and his ancestors  if my memory serves me  have never given

their name to anything  however   continued benvenuto  turning to

françois  and changing his expression and his tone   it may be that i

have made too hold it may be that i shall incur the hatred of powerful

and influential persons  who  despite your majesty s protection  may

prove too strong for me at last  the provost of paris is said to have

something very like an army at his orders  



 i have been told   the king interrupted   that on a certain day  at

rome  one cellini  a goldsmith  retained  in default of payment

therefor  a silver vase ordered by monsieur farnese  then cardinal  and

to day pope  



 it is true  sire  



 furthermore  that the cardinal s whole household stormed the

goldsmith s studio  sword in hand  with the design of carrying away the

vase by force  



 that  too  is true  



 but this cellini  in ambush behind the door  armed with his carbine 

did defend himself so valorously that he put monseigneur le cardinal s

people to flight  and was paid by the cardinal on the following day  



 all that  sire  is strictly true  



 very good  are not you the cellini in question  



 yes  sire  let your majesty but continue to bestow your favor upon me

and nothing has any power to terrify me  



 in that case  go straight before you   said the king  smiling in his

beard   go where you will  since you are of noble blood  



madame d etampes said no more  but she registered a mental vow of deadly

hatred to cellini from that moment   the hatred of an offended woman 



 one last favor  sire   said cellini   i cannot present all my workmen

to you  they are ten in number  some french  some german  all worthy 

talented comrades  but here are my two pupils whom i brought from italy

with me  pagolo and ascanio  come forward  pagolo  and raise your head

and your eyes a little  not impertinently  but like an honest man who

has no evil action to blush for  this good fellow lacks inventive genius

perhaps  sire  and is slightly lacking in earnestness  too  but he is a

careful  conscientious artist  who works slowly  but well  who

comprehends my ideas perfectly  and executes them faithfully  and this

is ascanio  my noble hearted  amiable pupil  and my beloved child  it is

doubtless true that he has not the vigorous creative faculty which will

represent in a bas relief the serried ranks of two hostile armies

meeting in deadly encounter  and tearing each other to pieces  or lions

and tigers clinging with claws and teeth to the edge of a vase  nor has

he the original fancy which invents horrible chimeras and impossible

dragons  no  but his soul  which resembles his body  has the instinct of

a divine ideal  so to speak  ask him to design an angel  or a group of

nymphs  and no one can equal the exquisite poesy and grace of his work 

with pagolo i have four arms  with ascanio i have two souls  and then he

loves me  and i am very happy to have always by my side a pure and

devoted heart like his  



while his master was speaking  ascanio stood near him  modestly  but

without embarrassment  in an attitude of unstudied grace  and madame

d etampes could not remove her eyes from the fascinating young italian 

black eyed and black haired  who seemed a living copy of apollino 



 if ascanio   said she   understands grace and beauty so well  and if he

cares to come some morning to the hôtel d etampes  i will furnish him

with precious stones and gold  with which he may cause some marvellous

flower to bloom for me  



ascanio bowed and thanked her with a glance 



 and i   said the king   grant to him  as well as to pagolo  a yearly

pension of one hundred crowns  



 i undertake to make them earn their pension  sire   said benvenuto 



 but who is the lovely child with the long eyelashes  hiding yonder in

the corner   said françois  spying scozzone for the first time 



 oh  pay no attention to her  sire   replied benvenuto  with a frown 

 she is the only one of the beautiful things in this studio whom i like

not to have noticed  



 aha  you are jealous  my benvenuto  



 mon dieu  sire  i like not that any hand should be laid upon my

property  to compare small things with great  it is as if some other

should dare to think of madame d etampes  you would be furious  sire 

scozzone is my duchess  



the duchess  who was gazing at ascanio  bit her lips at this

unceremonious interruption  many courtiers smiled in spite of

themselves  and all the ladies giggled  as for the king  he laughed

outright 



 foi de gentilhomme  your jealousy is within its right  benvenuto  and

an artist and a king may well understand each other  adieu  my friend  i

commend my statues to your attention  you will commence with jupiter 

naturally  and when you have finished the model you will show it to me 

adieu  and good luck  we will meet at the hôtel de nesle  



 to bid me show you the model is a simple matter  sire  but how shall i

gain entrance to the louvre  



 your name will be given at the gates  with orders to introduce you to

my presence  



cellini bowed  and with pagolo and ascanio  escorted the king and court

to the street  at the door he knelt and kissed the king s hand 



 sire   he said with deep feeling   you have heretofore saved me from

captivity  perhaps from death  through the intervention of monseigneur

de montluc  you have overwhelmed me with wealth  you have honored my

poor studio with your presence  but far more than all this  sire  is the

fact  and i know not how to thank you that it is so  that you so

magnificently anticipate all my dreams  we ordinarily work only for a

chosen few scattered through the centuries  but i shall have  had the

signal honor of finding a living judge  always present  always

enlightened  until now i have been only the workman of the future 

permit me henceforth to call myself your majesty s goldsmith  



 my workman  my goldsmith  my artist  and my friend  benvenuto  if the

last title seems to you no more deserving of contempt than the others 

adieu  or rather   au revoir   



it is needless to say that all the princes and nobles followed the

example set by the king  and loaded cellini with flattery and offers of

friendship 



when all were gone  and benvenuto was left alone in the courtyard with

his pupils  they thanked him  ascanio effusively  pagolo with something

very like constraint 



 nay  do not thank me  my children  it s not worth while  but look you 

if you do in truth consider yourselves under any obligation to me  i

wish  since this subject of conversation was introduced to day  to ask a

service at your hands  it relates to something which i have very much at

heart  you heard what i said to the king apropos of catherine  and what

i said to him truly expressed the deepest feeling of my heart  the child

is necessary to my life  my friends  to my life as an artist  because 

as you know  her services as a model are offered so freely and joyously 

to my life as a man  because i think that she loves me  i pray you 

therefore  although she is beautiful  and although you are young  as she

also is  do not let your thoughts rest upon catherine  there are enough

other lovely girls in the world  do not tear my heart  do not insult my

affection by casting bold glances upon my scozzone  nay  rather watch

over her in my absence  and advise her as if you were her brothers  i

conjure you  observe my wishes herein  for i know myself and my feeling

in this matter  and i swear before god  that if i should discover aught

amiss  i would kill her and her accomplice  



 master   said ascanio   i respect you as my master  and i love you as

my father  have no fear  



 blessed jesus   cried pagolo  clasping his hands   may god preserve me

from thinking of such an infamous action  do i not know that i owe

everything to you  and would it not be a crime thus to abuse your sacred

confidence in me  and to repay your benefactions by such dastardly

treachery  



 thanks  my friends   said benvenuto  pressing their hands   i have

perfect faith in you  and i am content  now  pagolo  return to your

work  for i have promised the seal at which you are working to m  de

villeroi for to morrow  while ascanio and myself pay a visit to the

estate which our gracious king has bestowed upon us  and of which we

will take possession on sunday next  peaceably or by force  



then he turned to ascanio 



 come  ascanio   said he   let us go and see if this nesle habitation 

which seemed to you so eligible in its external aspect  has internal

appointments corresponding to its reputation  



before ascanio had time to offer any observation  benvenuto  with a

parting glance over the studio to see if every workman was in his place 

and a light tap upon scozzone s plump  rosy cheek  passed his arm

through his pupil s  drew him toward the door  and went out with him 









vi





to what use a duenna may be put





they had taken hardly ten steps in the street  when they met a man of

some fifty years  rather short of stature  but with a handsome  mobile

countenance 



 i was about to call upon you  benvenuto   said the new arrival  whom

ascanio saluted with respect  mingled with veneration  and whose hand

benvenuto cordially grasped 



 is your business of importance  my dear francesco   said the goldsmith 

 in that case  i will return with you  or was it for no other purpose

than a friendly call  in that case  come with us  



 it was to proffer you some friendly advice  benvenuto  



 i will gladly listen  advice is always a good thing to receive when it

is proffered by a friend  



 but that which i have to give you is for no other ear than yours  



 this youth is another myself  francesco  say on  



 i would already have done so  had i thought that i ought to do it  

replied benvenuto s friend 



 pardon  master   said ascanio  discreetly moving apart 



 very well  go alone whither i purposed going with you  dear boy   said

benvenuto   as you know  when you have seen a thing it is as if i had

myself seen it  look most carefully into every detail  see if the studio

will have a good light  if the courtyard will be a convenient place for

a furnace  and if it will be possible to separate our workshop from that

of the other apprentices  do not forget the tennis court  



with that benvenuto passed his arm through the stranger s  waved his

hand to ascanio  and returned to the studio  leaving the young man

standing in the middle of rue saint martin 



in very truth there was in the commission intrusted to him by his master

more than enough to embarrass ascanio  his embarrassment was by no means

slight  even when benvenuto proposed that they should make the visit of

inspection in company  judge  then  what it became when he found himself

confronted with the prospect of making it all alone  he had watched

colombe two sundays without daring to follow her  had followed her on

the third without daring to accost her  and now he was to present

himself at her home  and for what purpose  to examine the hôtel de

nesle  which benvenuto proposed  by way of pastime  to take from

colombe s father on the following sunday  willy nilly 



it was a false position for anybody  it was terrible for a lover 



fortunately it was a long distance from rue saint martin to the hôtel

de nesle  had it been only a step or two  ascanio would not have taken

them  but it was a half league  so he started 



nothing so familiarizes one with danger as to be separated from it by

a considerable time or distance  to all strong minds and happy

dispositions  reflection is a powerful auxiliary  ascanio belonged to

the latter class  in those days it was not fashionable to be disgusted

with life before one had fairly entered upon it  all the impulses were

ingenuous and ingenuously expressed   joy by laughter  sorrow by tears 

affectation was a thing almost unknown  in life as in art  and a comely

youth of twenty was in no wise ashamed in those days to confess that he

was happy 



but in all ascanio s embarrassment there was a certain amount of joy  he

had not expected to see colombe again until the following sunday  and he

was to see her that very day  thus he had gained six days  and six days

of waiting are  as everybody knows  six centuries according to a lover s

reckoning 



and so  as he approached his destination  the affair became more simple

in his eyes  he it was  to be sure  who had advised benvenuto to ask the

king for the hôtel de nesle for his studio  but could colombe take it

ill of him that he had desired to be near her  this installation of the

florentine goldsmith in the old palace of amaury could not  it was true 

be carried out without interference with colombe s father  who looked

upon it as his own  but would any real injury be inflicted upon messire

robert d estourville when he did not occupy it  moreover  there were a

thousand ways in which benvenuto could pay for his occupancy   a chased

cup for the provost  a necklace for his daughter  and ascanio would

undertake to make the necklace   might  and undoubtedly would  in that

artistic age  make the rough places smooth  ascanio had seen grand

dukes  kings  and popes ready to give their coronets  sceptres  or

tiaras as the price of one of the marvellous examples of his master s

art  after all  then  supposing that matters should take that course 

messire robert would eventually be in master benvenuto s debt  for

master benvenuto was so generous that  if messire robert showed a

disposition to be courteous and compliant  ascanio was certain that he 

master benvenuto  would deal right royally with him 



by the time he reached the end of rue saint martin  ascanio looked upon

himself as a messenger of peace  chosen by the lord to maintain

harmonious relations between two powers 



and yet  notwithstanding that conviction  ascanio was not sorry  surely

lovers are strange creatures  to lengthen his journey by ten minutes 

and instead of crossing the seine by boat  he walked the whole length of

the quays  and crossed by the pont aux moulins  it may be that he chose

that road because it was the same he had taken the evening before when

following colombe 



whatever his motive for making the detour  he finally found himself in

front of the hôtel de nesle in about twenty minutes 



but when he saw the little ogive door that he must pass through  when he

saw the turrets of the lovely little gothic palace boldly raising their

heads above the wall  when he thought that behind those jalousies  half

closed because of the heat  was his beautiful colombe  the whole

card house of happy dreams which he had built on the road vanished like

the structures one sees in the clouds  and which the wind overturns with

one blow of its wing  he found himself face to face with reality  and

reality did not seem to him the most reassuring thing in the world 



however  after a few moments of hesitation  hesitation which is the

harder to understand  in that he was absolutely alone upon the quay in

the intense heat  he realized that he must make up his mind to do

something  as there was nothing for him to do but find his way into the

hotel  he walked to the door and raised the knocker  but god only knows

when he would have let it fall  had not the door chanced to open at that

moment  bringing him face to face with a sort of master jacques  a man

about thirty years of age  half servant  half peasant  it was messire

robert d estourville s gardener 



ascanio and the gardener mutually recoiled a step 



 what do you want   said the gardener   whom do you seek  



ascanio  thus compelled to go forward with his mission  summoned all his

courage  and replied bravely   



 i desire to inspect the hotel  



 to inspect the hotel   cried the gardener in amazement   in whose

name  



 in the king s name   ascanio replied 



 in the king s name   cried the gardener   jesus dieu  does the king

intend to take it from us  



 perhaps so  



 but what does it mean  



 pray understand  my friend   said ascanio  with a self possession upon

which he mentally congratulated himself   that i have no explanation to

give you  



 true  with whom do you desire to speak  



 is monsieur le prévôt within   inquired ascanio  knowing perfectly

well that he was not 



 no  monsieur  he is at the châtelet  



 indeed  who takes his place in his absence  



 his daughter is here  mademoiselle colombe  



ascanio felt that he was blushing to his ears 



 and there is dame perrine  too   the gardener continued   does monsieur

desire to speak with dame perrine or with mademoiselle colombe  



this was a very simple question  surely  and yet it caused a terrible

conflict in ascanio s mind  he opened his mouth to say that he wished to

see mademoiselle colombe  and yet it was as if the audacious words

refused to pass his lips  and he asked for dame perrine  the gardener 

who had no suspicion that his question  which seemed so simple to him 

had caused such a disturbance  bowed in token of obedience  and went

across the courtyard toward the door of the petit nesle  ascanio

followed him 



he had to cross a second courtyard  pass through a second door  then

cross a small flower garden  ascend a flight of steps  and traverse a

long gallery  at the end of the gallery the gardener opened the door and

said   



 dame perrine  here is a young gentleman  who asks to inspect the hotel 

in the king s name  



with that he stood aside and made room for ascanio  who took his place

in the doorway 



as he glanced into the room  a cloud passed before his eyes  and he

leaned against the door frame for support  a very simple  and yet

entirely unforeseen thing had happened  dame perrine was with colombe 

and he found himself in the presence of both 



dame perrine was sitting at the spinning wheel  spinning  colombe was at

work at her embroidery frame  they raised their heads at the same

instant and looked toward the door 



colombe instantly recognized ascanio  she expected him  although her

reason told her that he was not likely to come  as for him  when he saw

the maiden s eyes raised to his face  although their expression was

infinitely soft and sweet  it seemed to him that he was dying 



the fact is  that he had anticipated a thousand difficulties  had

dreamed of a thousand obstacles to be surmounted before he could win his

way to his beloved  those obstacles would have aroused all his energy

and strengthened his resolution  and lo  everything came about as

naturally and simply as if god  touched by the purity of his passion 

had smiled upon it and blessed it from the first  he found himself in

her presence when he was least expecting it  and of all the beautiful

speech he had prepared  the fervent eloquence of which was to amaze and

move her  he could not recall a phrase  a word  a syllable 



colombe  for her part  sat motionless and dumb  the two pure souled

young creatures  who  as if they had been already joined in wedlock in

heaven  felt that they belonged to one another  and who  when once their

lives had brought them close together  would thenceforth form  like

salmacis and hermaphrodite  but one existence  were terrified at their

first meeting  trembled  hesitated  and stood face to face unable to

find words 



dame perrine  half rising from her chair  and preparing to put aside her

spinning  was the first to break the silence 



 what did that blockhead raimbault say   cried the worthy duenna   did

you hear  colombe   as colombe did not reply  she continued  walking

toward ascanio   what is your pleasure here  my young master  why  god

forgive me   she suddenly exclaimed  as she recognized the visitor 

 it s the gallant youth who so politely handed me the holy water at the

church door these last three sundays  what is your pleasure  my handsome

friend  



 i would be glad to speak with you   faltered ascanio 



 with me alone   queried dame perrine coquettishly 



 with you  alone   



as he made this reply ascanio told himself that he was a consummate ass 



 come this way  then  young man   said dame perrine  opening a door at

the side of the room  and signing to ascanio to follow her 



ascanio did as she bade him  but as he left the room he cast upon

colombe one of those long  eloquent glances wherein lovers can say so

much  and which  however unintelligible they may be to indifferent

observers  are always understood at last by the person to whom they are

addressed  colombe undoubtedly lost no portion of its meaning  for her

eyes  how she knew not  having met the youth s  she blushed

prodigiously  and when she felt that she was blushing  she cast her eyes

down upon her embroidery  and began to mangle a poor inoffensive flower 

ascanio saw the blush  and  stopping abruptly  stepped toward colombe 

but at that moment dame perrine turned and called him  and he was

compelled to follow her 



he had no sooner crossed the threshold of the door than colombe dropped

her needle  let her arms fall beside her chair  threw back her head  and

breathed a long sigh  in which were mingled  by one of those

inexplicable miracles which the heart alone can perform  regret at

ascanio s departure  and a sort of relief to feel that he was no longer

there 



the young man was very perceptibly in a bad humor  with benvenuto  who

had given him such a strange commission to fulfil  with himself  for his

inability to take advantage of his opportunity  but most of all with

dame perrine  who was cruel enough to make him leave the room just when

colombe s eyes seemed to bid him remain 



so it was that  when the duenna inquired as to the purpose of his visit 

ascanio replied in a most deliberate manner  determined to be revenged

upon her for his own bungling   



 the purpose of my visit  my dear madame  is to beg you to show me the

hôtel de nesle from one end to the other  



 show you the hôtel de nesle   cried dame perrine   why  in heaven s

name  do you desire to see it  



 to see if it will be convenient for us  if we shall be comfortable

here  and if it is worth while for us to leave our present quarters to

come and live here  



 what  come and live here  pray have you hired the hotel of monsieur le

prévôt  



 no  but his majesty gives it to us  



 his majesty gives it to you   exclaimed dame perrine  more and more

amazed 



 absolutely   replied ascanio 



 to you  



 not precisely  my good woman  but to my master  



 and who is your master  if i may ask  young man  some great foreign

nobleman  no doubt  



 better than that  dame perrine   a great artist  come hither from

florence  expressly to serve his most christian majesty  



 aha   said the good woman  who did not understand very well   what does

your master make  



 what does he make  why  he makes everything  rings to put on maidens 

fingers  ewers to put upon kings  tables  statues to place in the

temples of the gods  and in his leisure moments he besieges or defends

cities  as his caprice leads him to cause an emperor to tremble  or to

reassure a pope  



 jésus dieu   cried dame perrine   what is your master s name  



 his name is benvenuto cellini  



 it s strange that i don t know that name   muttered the duenna   what

is his profession  



 he is a goldsmith  



dame perrine gazed wonderingly at ascanio 



 a goldsmith   she muttered   a goldsmith  and do you fancy that

monsieur le prévôt will give up his palace like this to a  goldsmith  



 if he doesn t give it up  we will take it  



 by force  



 even so  



 but your master will hardly dare to contend against monsieur le

prévôt  i trust  



 he has contended against three dukes and two popes  



 jésus dieu  two popes  he s not a heretic surely  



 he is as good a catholic as you and i  dame perrine  have no fear on

that score  satan is in no wise our ally  but in default of the devil 

we have the king on our side  



 so  but monsieur le prévôt has a more powerful protector than the

king  



 whom has he  pray  



 madame d etampes  



 then we are on equal terms   said ascanio 



 but suppose messire d estourville refuses  



 master benvenuto will take  



 and suppose messire d estourville shuts himself up here as in a

citadel  



 master cellini will lay siege to it  



 consider that the provost has twenty four sergeants at arms  



 master benvenuto cellini has ten apprentices  still we are on equal

terms  you see  dame perrine  



 but messire d estourville is personally a sturdy fighter  at the

tournament which took place at the time of the marriage of françois i  

he was one of the challengers  and all those who dared measure swords

with him were unhorsed  



 ah well  dame perrine  then he is just the man for benvenuto  who has

never met his match  and who  like messire d estourville  always

unhorses his adversaries  but there is this difference between them  a

fortnight afterward  they who have encountered your provost are on their

legs again in good health and spirits  while they who have my master to

deal with never raise their heads again  and three days after are dead

and buried  



 evil will come of this  evil will come of this   muttered dame perrine 

 young man  they say that fearful things are done in cities taken by

assault  



 have no fear on that head  dame perrine   rejoined ascanio with a

smile   you will have to do with generous conquerors  



 what i mean  my dear child   said dame perrine  who was not sorry

perhaps  to secure a friend among the besiegers   is that i fear there

may be bloodshed  for  so far as your proximity to us is concerned  you

will understand that it cannot fail to be very agreeable to us  since

society is somewhat scanty in this accursed desert to which messire

d estourville has consigned his daughter and myself  like two wretched

nuns  although neither she nor i have taken the vows  thank god  it isn t

good for man to be alone  so saith holy writ  and when holy writ

mentions man  woman is included  is not that your opinion  young man  



 that goes without saying  



 and we are entirely alone  and therefore very doleful in this vast

habitation  



 why  do you receive no visitors here   ascanio asked 



 jésus dieu  it s worse than if we were nuns  as i told you  nuns have

parents at least  and friends who come and talk to them through the

grating  they have the refectory where they can assemble and talk

together  it s not very diverting  i know  but it s something

nevertheless  but we have only messire le prévôt  who comes from time

to time to lecture his daughter for growing too lovely  i think   it s

her only crime  poor child   and to scold me because i don t watch her

closely enough   god save the mark  when she doesn t see a living soul

in the world except myself  and  aside from what she says to me  doesn t

open her mouth except to pray  i beg you  therefore  young man  not

to say to any one that you have been admitted here  that you have

inspected the grand nesle under my guidance  or that you talked with us

for an instant at the petit nesle  



 what   cried ascanio   after our visit to the grand nesle  i am to

return with you to the petit  in that case i shall    he checked

himself  realizing that his joy was carrying him too far 



 i think it would not be courteous  young man  after presenting

yourself  as you did  to mademoiselle colombe  who is the mistress of

the house in her father s absence  and after asking to speak with me

alone   i do not think it would be courteous  i say  to leave the hôtel

de nesle without taking leave of her  but if you prefer not to do so 

you are quite at liberty  as you know  to go into the street directly

from the grand nesle  which has its own exit  



 no  no  no indeed   cried ascanio  eagerly   peste  i flatter myself 

dame perrine  that i have been as well brought up as anybody on earth 

and that i know what good breeding requires in one s treatment of

ladies  but  let us do what we have to do  dame perrine  without a

moment s delay  for i am in very great haste  



indeed  now that ascanio knew that he was to return by way of the

petit nesle he was in a great hurry to be done with the grand  and as

dame perrine was terribly afraid of being surprised by the provost when

she least expected it  she had no inclination to delay ascanio  so she

took down a bunch of keys from behind a door  and walked on before him 



let us  in company with ascanio  east a hasty glance at this hôtel de

nesle  where the principal scenes of our narrative will be laid 



the hôtel  or rather the séjour de nesle  as it was more commonly

called at that time  occupied  as our readers already know  the site on

the left bank of the seine  on which the hôtel de nevers was

subsequently built  to be in its turn succeeded by the mint and the

institute  it was the last building in paris toward the southwest  and

beyond its walls nothing could be seen save the city moat  and the

verdant lawns of the pré aux clercs  it was built by amaury  lord of

nesle in picardie  toward the close of the eighth century  philippe le

bel bought it in 1308 and made it his royal residence  in 1520 the tour

de nesle  of bloody and licentious memory  was separated from it  when

the quay  the bridge over the moat  and the porte de nesle were

constructed  and thenceforth the grim tower stood alone upon the river

bank  like a sinner doing penance 



but the séjour de nesle luckily was so vast that the lopping off of

part of it was not noticed  it was as large as a small village  a high

wall  pierced by a broad ogive door and a smaller servants  door 

protected it on the side of the quay  on entering you found yourself at

first in an immense courtyard surrounded by walls  there was a door in

the wall at the left  and one at the back  passing through the door at

the left  as ascanio did  you came to a charming little building in the

gothic style of the fourteenth century  it was the petit nesle  which

had its own separate garden  if  on the other hand  you passed through

the door in the rear wall  you saw at your right the grand nesle   all

of stone  and flanked by two turrets   with its high peaked roofs 

surrounded by balustrades  its angular façade  its high windows with

glass of many colors  and its twenty weather vanes crying in the wind 

there was room enough to provide accommodation for three bankers of

to day 



if you went on  you lost yourself in all sorts of gardens  and you found

among them a tennis court  a bowling green  a foundry  and an arsenal 

and still farther on the stable yards  stables  cattle sheds  and

sheepfolds  there was accommodation for the establishments of three

farmers of to day 



the whole property  it should be said  was sadly neglected  and

consequently in very bad condition  for raimbault and his two assistants

hardly sufficed to take proper care of the garden belonging to the

petit nesle  where colombe raised flowers  and dame perrine vegetables 

but the whole was of vast extent  well lighted  and substantially built 

and with a slight outlay of trouble and money  it could be made the

finest workshop in the world 



even if the place had been infinitely less suitable  ascanio would have

been none the less enchanted with it  as his principal desire was to be

brought near to colombe 



his visit to the larger building was made very short  in less time than

it takes to write it  the active youth saw everything that there was to

see  and formed an opinion upon everything that he saw  dame perrine 

finding it impossible to keep pace with him  good naturedly handed him

the keys  which he faithfully restored to her when his investigation was

at an end 



 now  dame perrine   said he   i am at your service  



 very good  let us return for a moment to the petit nesle  as you agree

with me that it is the proper thing to do  



 i should say as much  it would be extremely discourteous to do

otherwise  



 but not a word to colombe of the object of your visit  



 mon dieu  what shall i say to her  then   cried ascanio 



 you re easily embarrassed  my handsome lad  did you not tell me that

you are a goldsmith  



 indeed  yes  



 very well  talk to her about jewels  that is a subject that always

gladdens the heart of the most virtuous maiden  she is or is not a true

daughter of eve  and if she is a true daughter of eve she loves anything

that glitters  besides  she has so little diversion in her solitude 

poor child  that it would be a blessing to entertain her a little  to be

sure  the most suitable entertainment for a girl of her age would be a

good marriage  and master robert never comes hither that i do not

whisper in his ear   find a husband for the poor dear  pray find a

husband for her   



without stopping to consider what conjectures as to the relations

between herself and the provost might be set on foot by this declaration

of her familiar manner of addressing him  dame perrine led the way back

to the petit nesle and to the room where they had left colombe 



colombe was still absorbed in thought  and in the same attitude in which

we left her  but no one knows how many times she had raised her head and

fixed her eyes upon the door through which the comely youth had gone

from her sight  any one who had observed these oft repeated glances

might have thought that she was expecting him  but as she saw the door

turning upon its hinges  colombe went about her work once more so

earnestly that neither dame perrine nor ascanio could suspect that it

had been interrupted 



how she had divined that the young man was following the duenna is

something that might have been explained by magnetism  if magnetism had

then been invented 



 i bring back with me our donor of holy water  my dear colombe  for he

it is  as i thought  i was about to show him out by the door of the

grand nesle  when he reminded me that he had not taken leave of you  it

was true enough  for you didn t say one little word to each other

before  however  neither of you is dumb  god be praised  



 dame perrine    faltered colombe  greatly embarrassed 



 well  what is it  you must not blush like that  monsieur ascanio is an

honorable young man  as you are a virtuous young woman  furthermore  it

seems that he is an artist in jewels  precious stones  and such gewgaws

as suit the fancy of most pretty girls  he will come and show them to

you  my child  if you wish  



 i need nothing   murmured colombe 



 possibly not at this moment  but it is to be hoped that you will not

die a recluse in this accursed solitude  we are but sixteen years old 

colombe  and the day will come when we shall be a lovely  fiancée   to

whom all sorts of jewels will be presented  and after that a great lady 

who must have all sorts of finery  when that time comes  it will be as

well to give the preference to this youth s as to those of some other

artist  who surely will not be comparable to him  



colombe was on the rack  ascanio  to whom dame perrine s forecasts of

the future were but moderately pleasing  noticed her suffering  and came

to the rescue of the poor child  to whom direct conversation was a

thousand times less embarrassing than this monologue by a

self constituted interpreter 



 oh  mademoiselle   said he   do not deny me the great privilege of

bringing some of my handiwork to you  it seems to me now as if i made

them for you  and as if when making them i was thinking of you  oh 

believe it  i pray you  for we artists in jewels sometimes mingle our

own thoughts with the gold and silver and precious stones  in the

diadems with which your heads are crowned  the bracelets which encircle

your white arms  the necklaces which rest so lovingly upon your

shoulders  in the flowers  the birds  the angels  the chimeras  which we

make to tremble at your ears  we sometimes embody our respectful

adoration  



it is our duty as an historian to state that at these soft words

colombe s heart dilated  for ascanio  mute so long  was speaking at

last  and speaking as she had dreamed that he would speak  for without

raising her eyes the girl could feel his burning glance fixed upon her 

and there was nothing  even to the unfamiliar tone of his voice  which

did not impart a singular charm to these words which sounded so

strangely in colombe s ears  and a profound and irresistible meaning to

the flowing  harmonious language of love  which maidens understand

before they can speak it 



 i know   ascanio continued  with his eyes still fixed upon colombe   i

know that we can add nothing to your beauty  god is made none the richer

by decking out his altar  but we can at least surround your graceful

form with those things which are attractive and beautiful like itself 

and when we poor  humble artificers of splendor and enchantment from the

depths of our obscurity see you pass by in a blaze of glory  we console

ourselves for being so far below you by the thought that our art has

helped to raise you to the height whereon you stand  



 o monsieur   replied colombe  covered with confusion   your lovely

things will probably be always unfamiliar to me  or at least useless  i

live in solitude and obscurity  and so far is it from being the case

that the solitude and obscurity are oppressive to me  that i confess

that i love them  i confess that i would like to live here always  and

yet i also confess that i would like well to see your jewels  not for

myself but for them   not to wear them  but to admire them  



trembling with fear lest she had said too much  and perhaps with a

longing to say even more  colombe bowed and left the room so swiftly 

that to the eyes of a man more knowing in such matters her exit would

have worn the aspect of a flight 



 well  well   exclaimed dame perrine   that s not a long way from

something like coquetry  there is no doubt  young man  that you talk

like a book  yes  yes  one can but believe that you italians have secret

means of fascinating people  no stronger proof is needed than

this   that you have enlisted me on your side at once  and  pon honor  i

find myself wishing that messire le prévôt will not deal too hardly

with you   au revoir   young man  and bid your master be on his guard 

warn him that messire d estourville is as hard of heart as the devil 

and wields great influence at court  for which reason  if your master

will take my advice  he will abandon all thought of living at the

grand nesle  and especially of taking forcible possession of it  as for

you  but we shall see you again  shall we not  above all  do not believe

colombe  the property of her deceased mother is sufficient to enable her

to indulge in baubles twenty times more costly than those you offer her 

and look you  bring also some less elaborate articles  it may occur to

her to make me a little present  i am not yet  thank god  so old that i

need decline a little flirtation  you understand  do you not  



deeming it necessary  the better to make her meaning clear  to enforce

her words with a gesture  she laid her hand upon the young man s arm 

ascanio jumped like one suddenly awakened from a sound sleep  indeed  it

seemed to him as if it were all a dream  he could not realize that he

was under colombe s roof  and he doubted whether the white apparition

whose melodious voice was still whispering in his ear  whose slender

form had just vanished from his sight  was really she for one glance

from whose eyes he would have given his life that morning 



overflowing with his present happiness and his future prospects  he

promised dame perrine whatever she wished  without even listening to

what she asked him to do  what mattered it to him  was he not ready to

give all that he possessed to see colombe once more 



thinking that to prolong his visit would be unbecoming  he took leave of

dame perrine  promising to return the next day 



as he left the petit nesle  ascanio almost collided with two men who

were about to enter  by the way in which one of them stared at him  even

more than by his costume  he felt sure that it was the provost 



his suspicion was changed to certainty when he saw them knock at the

same door by which he had just come out  and he regretted that he had

not sooner taken his leave  for who could say that his imprudence would

not be visited upon colombe 



to negative the idea that his visit was of any importance  assuming that

the provost noticed it  ascanio walked away without once turning to look

back toward the only corner of the world of which he would at that

moment have cared to be king 



when he returned to the studio  he found benvenuto absorbed in thought 

the man who stopped them in the street was primaticcio  and he was on

his way  like the honorable confrère he was  to inform cellini that 

during the visit françois i  paid him that morning  the imprudent

artist had succeeded in making a mortal enemy of madame la duchesse

d etampes 









vii





a lover and a friend





one of the two men who entered the hôtel de nesle as ascanio emerged

therefrom was indeed messire robert d estourville  provost of paris  who

the other was we shall learn in a moment 



five minutes after ascanio s departure  while colombe was still

listening and dreaming in her bedroom  whither she had fled  dame

perrine hurriedly entered  and informed the young woman that her father

was awaiting her in the adjoining room 



 my father   cried colombe in alarm   mon dieu  mon dieu   she added in

an undertone   can it be that he met him  



 yes  your father  my dear child   rejoined dame perrine  replying to

the only portion of the sentence that she heard   and with him another

old man whom i do not know  



 another old man   exclaimed colombe  shuddering instinctively   mon

dieu  dame perrine  what does it mean  it is the first time in two or

three years that my father has not come hither alone  



however  notwithstanding her alarm she could but obey  knowing as she

did her father s impatient disposition  so she summoned all her courage

and returned to the room she had just left with a smile upon her lips 

despite this feeling of dread  which she experienced for the first time

and could not explain  she loved messire d estourville as a daughter

should love her father  and although his demeanor toward her was far

from expansive  the days on which he visited the hôtel de nesle were

marked as red letter days among the uniformly gloomy days of her life 



colombe went forward with outstretched arms and her mouth half open  but

the provost gave her no time either to embrace him or to speak  he took

her hand  and led her to the stranger  who was leaning against the

flower laden mantel 



 my dear friend   he said   i present my daughter to you  colombe   he

added   this is comte d orbec  the king s treasurer and your future

husband  



colombe uttered a feeble exclamation  which she at once stifled  out of

regard for the requirements of courtesy  but feeling her knees giving

way beneath her  she leaned against the back of a chair for support 



fully to understand the horror of this unexpected presentation 

especially in colombe s then frame of mind  it is necessary to know what

manner of man this comte d orbec was 



messire robert d estourville  colombe s father  was certainly far from

handsome  there was in his bushy eyebrows  which he drew together at the

least obstacle  physical or moral  that he encountered  a savage

expression  and in his whole thickset figure something heavy and

awkward  which caused one to feel but slightly prepossessed in his

favor  but beside comte d orbec he seemed like saint michael the

archangel beside the dragon  the square head and the strongly

accentuated features of the provost did at least indicate resolution and

force of character  while his small  piercing gray lynx eyes denoted

intelligence  but comte d orbec  lean and withered  with his long arms

like spider s claws his mosquito like voice and his snail like

movements  was not only ugly  he was absolutely hideous   it was the

ugliness of the beast and the villain in one  his head was carried on

one side  and his face wore a villanous smile and a treacherous

expression 



so it was that colombe  at the sight of this revolting creature  who was

presented to her as her future husband when her heart and her thoughts

and her eyes were still filled with the comely youth who had just gone

from that very room  could not  as we have seen  wholly repress an

exclamation of dismay  but her strength failed her  and she stood there

pale and speechless  gazing terror stricken into her father s face 



 i beseech you to pardon colombe s confusion  dear friend   the provost

continued   in the first place  she is a little barbarian  who has not

been away from here these two years past  the air of the time being not

over healthy  as you know  for attractive maids  secondly  i have made

the mistake of not informing her of our plans  which would have been

time lost  however  since what i have determined upon needs no person s

approval before being put in execution  and lastly  she knows not who

you are  and that with your name  your great wealth  and the favor of

madame d etampes  you are in a position where everything is possible 

but upon reflection she will appreciate the honor you confer upon us in

consenting to ally your ancient blood with our nobility of more recent

date  she will learn that friends of forty years  standing   



 enough  my dear fellow  enough  in god s name   interposed the count 

 come  come  my child   he added  addressing colombe with familiar and

insolent assurance  which formed a striking contrast to poor ascanio s

timidity    come  compose yourself and call back to your cheeks a little

of the lovely coloring that so becomes you  mon dieu  i know what a

young girl is  you know  and a young woman too for that matter  for i

have already been married twice  my dear  good lack  you must not be

disturbed like this  i don t frighten you  i hope  eh   added the count

fatuously  passing his fingers through his scanty moustache and

imperial   your father did wrong to give me the title of husband so

suddenly  which always agitates a youthful heart a little when it hears

it for the first time  but you will come to it  little one  and will end

by saying it yourself with that sweet little mouth of yours  well 

well  you are growing paler and paler   god forgive me  i believe she is

fainting  



as he spoke d orbec put out his arms to support her  but she stood

erect  and stepped back as if she feared his touch no less than a

serpent s  finding strength to utter a few words   



 pardon  monsieur  pardon  father   she faltered   forgive me  it is

nothing  but i thought  i hoped   



 what did you think  what did you hope  come  tell us quickly   rejoined

the provost  fixing his sharp eyes  snapping angrily  upon his daughter 



 that you would allow me to stay with you always  father   replied

colombe   since my poor mother s death  you have no one else to love you

and care for you  and i had thought   



 hold your peace  colombe   retorted the provost imperatively   i am not

old enough as yet to need a keeper  and you have arrived at the proper

age to have an establishment of your own 



 bon dieu   interposed d orbec  joining once more in the conversation 

 accept me without so much ado  my love  with me you will be as happy as

one can be  and more than one will envy you  i swear  mordieu  i am

rich  and i propose  that you shall be a credit to me  you shall go to

court  and shall wear jewels that will arouse the envy  i will not say

of the queen  but of madame d etampes herself  



i know not what thoughts these last words awoke in colombe s heart  but

the color returned to her cheeks  and she made hold to answer the count 

despite her father s harsh and threatening glance   



 i will ask my father  monseigneur  at least to give me time to reflect

upon your proposal  



 what s that   cried messire d estourville violently   not an hour  not

a minute  you are from this moment the count s betrothed  understand

that  and you would be his wife this evening were it not that he is

obliged to pay a visit to his estates in normandie  and you know that my

wishes are commands  reflect indeed  sarpejeu  d orbec  let us leave her

ladyship  from this moment  my friend  she is yours  and you may claim

her when you will  and now let us go and inspect your future abode  



d orbec would have been glad to tarry and add a word to what he had

already said  but the provost passed his arm through his  and led him

away grumbling  he contented himself therefore with saluting colombe

with his wicked smile  and went out with messire robert 



behind them dame perrine entered through another door  she had heard the

provost speaking in a loud voice  and guessed that he was as usual

scolding his daughter  she arrived in time to receive colombe in her

arms 



 o mon dieu  mon dieu   sobbed the poor child  putting her hand over her

eyes as if to avoid the sight of the odious d orbec  absent though he

was   o mon dieu  is this to be the end  o my golden dreams  o my poor

hopes  all is lost  and naught remains for me but to die  



we need not ask if this lament  added to colombe s weakness and pallor 

terrified dame perrine  and at the same time aroused her curiosity  as

colombe sadly needed to relieve her overburdened heart  she described to

her worthy governess  weeping the while the bitterest tears she had ever

shed  the interview between her father  comte d orbec  and herself  dame

perrine agreed that the suitor was not young or handsome  but as the

worst misfortune  in her opinion  that could happen to a woman was to

remain single  she insisted that it was better  when all was said  to

have an old and ugly  but wealthy and influential husband  than none at

all  but this doctrine was so offensive to colombe s heart  that she

withdrew to her own room  leaving dame perrine  whose imagination was

most active  to build innumerable castles in the air in anticipation of

the day when she should rise from the rank of mademoiselle colombe s

governess to that of comtesse d orbec s  dame de compagnie  



meanwhile the provost and the count were beginning their tour of

inspection of the grand nesle  as dame perrine and ascanio had done an

hour earlier 



curious results would follow if walls  which are commonly supposed to

have ears  had also eyes and a tongue  and could repeat to those who

enter what they have seen and heard on the part of those who have gone

before 



but as the walls held their peace  and simply looked at the provost and

the treasurer  laughing perhaps  after the manner of walls  it was the

treasurer who spoke 



 on my word   he said  as they crossed the courtyard leading from the

petit to the grand nesle   on my word  the little one will do very well 

she is just such a woman as i need  my dear d estourville  virtuous 

well bred  and ignorant  when the first storm has passed over  time will

straighten out everything  believe me  i know how it is  every little

girl dreams of a young  handsome  clever  and wealthy husband  mon dieu 

i have at least half of the requisite qualities  few men can say as

much  so that s a great point in my favor   passing from his future wife

to the property he was to occupy  and speaking with the same shrill 

greedy accent of the one as of the other   this old nesle   he

continued   is a magnificent habitation  on my honor  and i congratulate

you upon it  we shall be marvellously comfortable here  my wife and i 

and my whole treasury  here we will have our own apartments  there will

be my offices  and over yonder the servants  quarters  the place as a

whole has been allowed to run to seed  but with the expenditure of a

little money  which we will find a way to make his majesty pay  we will

give a good account of ourselves  by the way  d estourville  are you

perfectly sure of retaining the property  you should take steps to

perfect your title to it  so far as i now remember  the king did not

give it you  after all  



 he did not give it me  true   replied the provost with a laugh   but he

let me take it  which is much the same thing  



 very good  but suppose that some other should play you the trick of

making a formal request for it from him  



 ah  such a one would be very ill received  i promise you  when he

should come to take possession  and  being sure as i am of madame

d etampes s support and yours  i would make him sorely repent his

pretensions  no  no  my dear fellow  my mind is at ease  and the hôtel

de nesle belongs to me as truly as my daughter colombe belongs to you 

go  therefore  without fear on that score  and return quickly  



as the provost uttered these words  the truth of which neither he nor

his interlocutor had any reason to doubt  a third personage  escorted by

raimbault the gardener  appeared upon the threshold of the door leading

from the quadrangular courtyard into the gardens of the petit nesle  it

was the vicomte de marmagne 



he also was a suitor for colombe s hand  but by no means a favored one 

he was a fair haired scamp  with a pink face  consequential  insolent 

garrulous  forever boasting of his relations with women  who often used

him as a cloak for their serious amours  overflowing with pride in his

post of secretary to the king  which permitted him to approach his

majesty in the same way in which his greyhounds and parrots and monkeys

approached him  the provost  therefore  was not deceived by his apparent

favor and the superficial familiarity of his relations with his majesty 

which favor and familiarity he owed  so it was said  to his decidedly

unmoral additions to the duties of his post  furthermore  the vicomte de

marmagne had long since devoured all his patrimony  and had no other

fortune than the liberality of françois  how it might happen any day

that this liberal disposition would cease  so far as he was concerned 

and messire robert d estourville was not fool enough to rely  in matters

of such importance  upon the caprice of a very capricious monarch  he

had therefore gently denied the suit of the vicomte de marmagne 

admitting to him confidentially and under the seal of secrecy that his

daughter s hand had long been promised to another  thanks to this

confidential communication  which supplied a motive for the provost s

refusal  the vicomte de marmagne and messire robert d estourville had

continued to be in appearance the best friends in the world  although

from that day the viscount detested the provost  and the provost was

suspicious of the viscount  who could not succeed in concealing his

rancor beneath an affable and smiling exterior from a man so accustomed

as messire robert to peer into the dark corners of courts  and the

deepest depths of men s hearts  so it was that  whenever the viscount

made his appearance  the provost expected to find in him 

notwithstanding his invariably affable and engaging demeanor  a bearer

of bad news  which he would always impart with tears in his eyes  and

with the feigned  premeditated grief which squeezes out poison upon a

wound  drop by drop 



as for comte d orbec  the vicomte de marmagne had wellnigh come to an

open rupture with him  it was one of the rare instances of court

enmities visible to the naked eye  d orbec despised marmagne  because

marmagne had no fortune and could make no display  marmagne despised

d orbec  because d orbec was old and had consequently lost the power of

making himself agreeable to women  in fine  they mutually detested each

other  because  whenever they met upon the same path  one of them had

taken something from the other 



so it was that when they met on this occasion the two courtiers greeted

each other with that cold  sardonic smile which is never seen save in

palace antechambers  and which means   ah  if we weren t a pair of

cowards  how long ago one of us would have ceased to live  



nevertheless  as it is the historian s duty to set down everything  good

and bad alike  it is proper to state that they confined themselves to

this salutation and this smile  and that comte d orbec  escorted by the

provost  and without exchanging a word with marmagne  left the house

immediately by the same door by which his enemy entered 



let us hasten to add  that  notwithstanding the hatred which kept them

asunder  these two men were ready  in case of need  to unite temporarily

to destroy a third 



comte d orbec having taken his leave  the provost found himself

 tête à tête  with the vicomte de marmagne  he walked toward him with

a joyous countenance  in striking contrast to the melancholy visage with

which the other awaited him 



 well  my dear provost   said marmagne  to open the conversation   you

seem in extremely good spirits  



 while you  my dear marmagne   rejoined the provost   seem sadly

depressed  



 simply because  as you know  my poor d estourville  my friends 

misfortunes afflict me as keenly as my own  



 yes  yes  i know your heart   said the provost 



 and when i saw you in such a joyous mood  with your future son in law 

comte d orbec   for your daughter s betrothal to him is no longer a

secret  and i congratulate you upon it  my dear d estourville   



 you know that i told you long ago that colombe s hand was promised  my

dear marmagne  



 yes  but   pon honor  i cannot understand how you can consent to part

from such a fascinating child  



 oh  i do not propose to part from her   replied messire robert   my

son in law  comte d orbec  will bring his whole establishment across the

seine  and will take up his abode at the grand nesle  while i shall

spend my unoccupied moments at the petit  



 my poor friend   exclaimed marmagne  shaking his head with an air of

profound sadness  and placing one hand upon the provost s arm while with

the other he wiped away a tear which did not exist 



 why  poor friend    demanded messire robert   come  what have you to

tell me now  



 am i the first  pray  to tell you the unpleasant news  



 what is it  speak out  



 you know  my dear provost  that we must take things philosophically in

this world  and there is an old proverb which we poor weak mortals

should keep constantly in mind  for it sums up the accumulated wisdom of

all nations  



 what is the proverb  say what you have to say  



 man proposes  my dear friend  man proposes  and god disposes  



 in god s name  what have i proposed for him to dispose of  say on  i

beg you  and let us have done with it  



 you have intended the grand nesle for the residence of your daughter

and son in law  



 most assuredly  and i trust that they will be installed there within

three months  



 undeceive yourself  my dear provost  undeceive yourself  the hôtel de

nesle is no longer your property at this moment  pardon me for

afflicting you thus  but i thought  knowing your somewhat hasty nature 

that it would be better for you to learn the news from the mouth of a

friend  who would spare your feelings in the telling as much as

possible  rather than from some malicious fellow  who would take a keen

delight in your misfortune  and brutally east it in your faee  alas  no 

my friend  the grand nesle is yours no longer  



 who has taken it from me  i pray to know  



 his majesty  



 his majesty  



 himself  so you see that the disaster is irreparable  



 when was it done  



 this morning  if i had not been detained by my duties at the louvre 

you would have been sooner apprised of it  



 you are mistaken  marmagne  it s some false report set afloat by my

enemies  and which you are in too great haste to repeat  



 i would be glad for many reasons if it were so  but unfortunately i was

not told of it  i heard it  



 you heard it  what  



 i heard the king with his own month present the grand nesle to

another  



 who is this other  



 an italian adventurer  a paltry goldsmith  whose name you perhaps have

heard  an intriguing rascal named benvenuto cellini  who came from

florence some two months since  whom the king has taken upon his

shoulders for some unknown reason  and to whom he paid a visit to day

with his whole court at the cardinal of ferrara s hotel  where this

pretended artist has established his studio  



 and you say that you were present  viscount  when the king presented

the grand nesle to this wretch  



 i was   replied marmagne  pronouncing the words very slowly and

distinctly  and dwelling upon them with evident relish 



 oho   said the provost   very good  i am ready for your adventurer  let

him come and take possession of his royal gift  



 do you mean that you would offer resistance  



 to be sure  



 to an order of the king  



 to an order of god or the devil   to any order  in short  which should

undertake to eject me from this place  



 softly  provost  softly   said marmagne   over and above the king s

wrath  to which you expose yourself  this benvenuto cellini is in

himself more to be feared than you think  



 do you know who i am  viscount  



 first of all  he stands very high in his majesty s good graces   only

for the moment  to be sure   but it is none the less true  



 do you know that i  the provost of paris  represent his majesty at the

châtelet  that i sit there beneath a canopy  in a short coat and a

cloak with a collar  with my sword at my side  a hat with waving plumes

on my head  and in my hand a staff covered with blue velvet  



 secondly  i will tell you that this accursed italian makes no scruple

of offering combat  as if he stood on equal terms with them  to princes 

cardinals  and popes  



 do you know that i have a private seal which imparts the fullest

authority to those documents to which it is affixed  



 it is said  furthermore  that the damned bully wounds or kills

recklessly every one who ventures to oppose him  



 do you not know that a bodyguard of twenty four men at arms is at my

orders night and day  



 they say that he attacked a goldsmith against whom he had a grudge 

although he was surrounded by a guard of sixty men  



 you forget that the hôtel de nesle is fortified  that the walls are

crenellated  and there are machicoulis above the doors  to say nothing

of the city fortifications which render it impregnable on one side  



 it is said that he is as thoroughly at home in the science of sieges as

bayard or antonio de leyra  



 as to that we shall see  



 i am sorely afraid  



 i will bide my time  



 look you  my dear friend  will you allow me to offer you a little

advice  



 say on  so that it be brief  



 do not try to struggle with one who is stronger than you  



 stronger than i  a paltry italian mechanic  viscount  you exasperate

me  



 you may find reason to repent   pon honor  i speak whereof i know  



 viscount  you try my temper  



 consider that the fellow has the king on his side  



 and i have madame d etampes  



 his majesty may take it ill of you to resist his will  



 i have already done it  monsieur  and successfully  



 yes  i know  in the matter of the toll at the bridge of mantes  but   



 but what  



 one risks nothing  or very little at all events  in resisting a weak 

good natured king  while one risks everything in entering into a contest

with a powerful  formidable opponent like benvenuto cellini  



 by mahomet s belly  viscount  do you propose to drive me mad  



 on the contrary  my purpose is to make you discreet  



 enough  viscount  enough  ah  the villain shall pay dear  i swear  for

these moments that your friendship has caused me to pass  



 god grant it  provost  god grant it  



 very good  very good  you have nothing else to tell me  



 no  no  i believe not   the viscount replied  as if he were trying to

recall some item of news which would make a fitting pendant to the

other 



 very well  adieu   cried the provost 



 adieu  my poor friend  



 adieu  



 at all events i have given you warning  



 adieu  



 i shall have no reason to reproach myself  that consoles me  



 adieu  adieu  



 good luck attend you  but i must say that i express that wish with but

little hope of its being gratified  



 adieu  adieu  adieu  



 adieu  



and the vicomte de marmagne  sighing as if his heart would burst  and

with grief stricken face  took his departure  gesticulating mournfully 

after he had pressed the provost s hand as if he were saying farewell to

him forever 



the provost followed him  and with his own hands secured the street door

behind him 



it will readily be understood that this friendly conversation had heated

messire d estourville s blood and stirred his bile to an extreme degree 

he was looking around in search of some one upon whom he might vent his

ill humor  when he suddenly remembered the young man whom he had seen

emerging from the grand nesle as he entered with comte d orbec  as

raimbault was at hand he had not far to seek for one who could answer

his questions touching that stranger  so he summoned the gardener with

one of those imperative gestures which admit no delay  and asked him

what he knew about the young man 



the gardener replied that the individual to whom his master referred had

presented himself in the king s name  to inspect the grand nesle  that

he did not consider it his duty to take anything upon himself  and

therefore referred him to dame perrine  who good naturedly showed him

over the whole establishment 



the provost thereupon rushed to the petit nesle to demand an explanation

from the worthy duenna  but she unfortunately had just gone out to

purchase the weekly supply of provisions 



there remained colombe  but as the provost could not believe that she

had seen the youthful stranger  after the forcible and explicit terms in

which he had forbidden dame perrine to allow good looking young men to

approach her  he did not even speak to her on the subject 



as his duties required him to return to the grand châtelet  he

departed  ordering raimbault  on pain of instant dismissal  to admit no

person to the grand or petit nesle  whoever he might be  or in

whosesoever name he might come  especially the miserable adventurer who

had been admitted previously 



so it was that  when ascanio presented himself on the following day with

his wares  in accordance with dame perrine s suggestion  raimbault

simply opened a small window  and informed him through the bars that the

hôtel de nesle was closed to everybody  particularly to him 



ascanio  as may be imagined  withdrew in despair  but we hasten to say

that he did not for a moment attribute this extraordinary reception to

colombe  the maiden had bestowed but one glance upon him  had uttered

but one sentence  but that glance was so eloquent of shy affection  and

there was such a wealth of loving melody in that one sentence  that it

had seemed to ascanio since he parted from her as if an angel s voice

were singing in his heart 



he fancied therefore  and with good reason  that  as he had been seen by

the provost  the provost was the author of that terrible order of which

he was the victim 









viii





preparations for attack and defence





ascanio had no sooner returned to the studio on the previous day  and

made his report to benvenuto touching that part of his expedition which

related to the topography of the hôtel de nesle  than the goldsmith 

seeing that it met his requirements in every respect  hastened to the

bureau of seigneur de neufville  the first secretary of the king s

treasury  to obtain from him documentary evidence of the royal gift 

seigneur de neufville demanded until the following day to assure himself

of the validity of master benvenuto s claims  and  although the latter

considered him extremely impertinent to refuse to take his word for it 

he realized the reasonableness of the demand  and assented  resolved

however not to allow messire de neufville a half hour s grace on the

following day 



he was punctual to the minute  and was at once admitted to the

secretary s presence  which he considered a favorable augury 



 well  monseigneur   he said   is the italian a liar  or did he tell you

the truth  



 the whole truth  my dear friend  



 that is very fortunate  



 and the king has ordered me to hand you a deed of gift in proper form  



 it will be welcome  



 and yet    continued the secretary  hesitatingly 



 well  what more is there  let us hear  



 and yet if you would allow me to offer you some good advice   



 good advice  the devil  that s a rare article  monsieur le secrétaire 

say on  say on  



 i should advise you to seek another location for your studio than the

grand nesle  



 indeed   retorted benvenuto dryly   think you that it is not a

convenient location  



 it is  indeed  and truth compels me to state that you would have great

difficulty in finding a better  



 very well  what is the matter then  



 that it belongs to a personage of too much importance for you to come

in collision with him without danger  



 i myself belong to the noble king of france   rejoined cellini   and i

shall never flinch so long as i act in his name  



 very good  but in our country  master benvenuto  every nobleman is king

in his own house  and in seeking to eject the provost from the house

which he occupies you risk your life  



 we must all die sooner or later   was cellini s sententious reply 



 you are determined  then   



 to kill the devil before the devil kills me  trust me for that 

monsieur le secrétaire  let the provost look well to himself  as all

those must do who assume to oppose the king s wishes  especially when

master benvenuto cellini has it in charge to carry them out  



thereupon messire nicolas de neufville made an end of his philanthropic

observations  but alleged all sorts of formalities to be complied with

before delivering the deed  but benvenuto tranquilly seated himself 

declaring that he would not stir until the document was placed in his

hands  and that he was determined to stay the night there  if necessary 

having foreseen that possibility  and taken the precaution to say to his

people that he might not return 



taking note of this determination  messire nicolas de neufville 

regardless of consequences  delivered the deed of gift to benvenuto

cellini  taking pains  however  to advise messire robert d estourville

of what he had been compelled to do  in part by the king s will  in part

by the goldsmith s persistence 



benvenuto returned to his domicile without saying anything to anybody of

what he had done  locked up the deed in the drawer in which he kept his

precious stones  and calmly resumed his work 



the information transmitted to the provost by the secretary convinced

messire robert that benvenuto  as the vicomte de marmagne had said that

he would do  persisted in his purpose to take possession of the hôtel

de nesle  peaceably or by force  the provost  therefore  prepared to

maintain his rights  sent for his twenty four sergeants at arms  posted

sentinels upon the walls  and went to the châtelet only when the duties

of his office absolutely compelled him to do so 



days passed  however  and cellini  tranquilly occupied with the work he

had in hand  made not the least demonstration  but the provost felt

certain that this apparent tranquillity was only a ruse  and that his

foe proposed to wait until he had grown weary of watching  and then take

him unawares  and so messire robert  with eyes and ears always on the

alert  his mind always in a state of extreme tension  and engrossed with

warlike thoughts  was finally reduced by this condition of affairs 

which was neither peace nor war  to a state of feverish expectation and

anxiety  which threatened  if it were prolonged  to make him as mad as

the governor of the castle of san angelo  he could not eat or sleep  and

grew perceptibly thinner 



from time to time he would abruptly draw his sword and begin to make

passes at a wall  shouting   



 let him come on  let him come on  the villain  let him come on  i am

ready for him  



but benvenuto did not come on 



d estourville had his calmer moments  too  during which he would succeed

in persuading himself that the goldsmith s tongue  was longer than his

sword  and that he would never dare to carry out his damnable schemes 

it was at one of these moments that colombe  happening to come out of

her room  observed all the warlike preparations  and asked her father

what was the occasion of them 



 a scoundrel to be chastised  that s all   the provost replied 



as it was the provost s business to chastise  colombe did not even ask

who the scoundrel was whose chastisement was preparing  being too deeply

preoccupied with her own thoughts not to be content with this brief

explanation 



in very truth  messire robert with a single word had made a fearful

change in his daughter s life  that life  hitherto so calm  so simple 

so obscure and secluded  that life of peaceful days and tranquil nights 

was like a lake whose surface is suddenly ruffled by a tempest  she had

felt at times before that her soul was sleeping  that her heart was

empty  but she thought that her solitude was the cause of her

melancholy  and attributed the emptiness of her heart to the fact that

she had lost her mother in her infancy  and now  without warning  her

existence  her thoughts  her heart and her soul were filled to

overflowing  but with grief 



ah  how she then sighed for the days of ignorance and tranquillity  when

the commonplace but watchful friendship of dame perrine was almost

sufficient for her happiness  the days of hope and faith  when she

reckoned upon the future as one reckons upon a friend  the days of

filial trust and confidence  when she believed in the affection of her

father  alas  her future now was the hateful love of comte d orbec  her

father s affection was simply ambition so disguised  why  instead of

being the only inheritor of a noble name and vast fortune  was she not

the child of some obscure bourgeois of the city  who would have cared

for and cherished her  in that case she might  have fallen in with this

young artist  in whose speech there was so much to move and fascinate 

this handsome ascanio  who seemed to have such a wealth of happiness and

love to bestow 



but when the rapid beating of her heart and her flushed cheeks warned

her that the stranger s image had filled her thoughts too long  she

condemned herself to the task of banishing the lovely dream  and

succeeded in placing before her eyes the desolating reality  since her

father had made known to her his matrimonial plans  she had expressly

forbidden dame perrine to receive ascanio  upon one pretext or another 

threatening to tell her father everything if she disobeyed  and as the

governess  fearing to be accused of complicity with him  had said

nothing of the hostile projects of ascanio s master  poor colombe

believed herself to be well protected in that direction 



it must not be supposed  however  that the sweet natured child was

resigned to the idea of obeying her father s commands  no  her whole

being revolted at the thought of an alliance with this man  whom she

would have hated had she really known what hate was  beneath her

beautiful  pale brow she revolved a thousand thoughts  hitherto unknown

to her mind   thoughts of revolt and rebellion  which she looked upon

almost as crimes  and for which she asked god s forgiveness upon her

knees  then it occurred to her to go and throw herself at the king s

feet  but she had heard it whispered that the same idea had occurred to

diane de poitiers under much more terrible circumstances  and that she

left her honor there  madame d etampes might protect her too  if she

chose  but would she choose  would she not greet the complaints of a

mere child with a contemptuous smile  such a smile of mockery and

contempt she had seen upon her father s lips when she begged him to keep

her with him  and it made a terrible impression upon her 



thus colombe had no refuge but god  and she knelt before her  prie dieu 

a hundred times a day  imploring the omnipotent to send succor to her

weakness before the end of the three months which still separated her

from her formidable  fiancé   or  if she could hope for no relief on

earth  to allow her at least to join her mother in heaven 



ascanio s existence  meanwhile  was no less troublous and unhappy than

that of his beloved  twenty times since raimbault had made known to him

the order which forbade his admission to the hôtel de nesle had he

loitered dreaming about the lofty walls which separated him from his

life   in the morning before anybody had risen  and at night after

everybody was asleep  but not once  either openly or furtively  did he

try to make his way into the forbidden garden  he still had that

virginal respect of early youth  which protects the woman whom one loves

against the very passion which she may have to fear at a later period 



but this did not prevent ascanio  as he worked away at his carving and

chasing  from indulging in many an extravagant dream  to say nothing of

those he dreamed in his morning and evening promenades  or during his

troubled sleep at night  these dreams were concerned more especially

with the day  at first so much dreaded  now so eagerly desired by him 

when benvenuto should assume possession of the hôtel de nesle  for

ascanio knew his master  and that all this apparent tranquillity was

that of a volcano breeding an eruption  cellini had given out that the

eruption would take place on the following sunday  ascanio had no doubt 

therefore  that on the following sunday cellini s undertaking would be

accomplished 



but so far as he was able to judge in his walks around the séjour de

nesle  the undertaking would not be accomplished without some

difficulty  thanks to the guard which was constantly maintained upon the

walls  and ascanio had observed about the hotel all the indications of a

fortified post  if there should be an attack  there would be a defence 

and as the fortress seemed little disposed to capitulate  it was clear

that it must be taken by assault  it was at that decisive moment that

ascanio s chivalrous nature might expect to find an opportunity to

display itself  there would be a battle  there would be a breach in the

walls to carry  and perhaps there would be a conflagration  ah 

something of that sort was what he longed for  a conflagration most of

all   a conflagration whereby colombe s life would be endangered  then

he would dart up the tottering staircases  among the burning rafters 

and over the crumbling walls  he would hear her voice calling for help 

he would seek her out  take her in his arms  dying and almost

unconscious  and bear her away to safety through the roaring sea of

flame  her heart against his  and inhaling her breath  then  having

brought her safely through a thousand dangers  he would lay her at the

feet of her despairing father  who would reward his gallant conduct by

giving her to the man who had saved her life  or else  as he bore her in

his arms over a frail plank thrown across the flaming chasm  his foot

would slip  and they would fall together and die in each other s arms 

their hearts blending in one last sigh  in a first and last kiss  this

latter alternative was not to be despised by one who had so little hope

in his heart as ascanio  for next to the felicity of living for each

other  the greatest happiness is to die together 



thus it will be seen that all our friends were passing through some very

agitated days and nights  with the exception of benvenuto cellini  who

seemed entirely to have forgotten his hostile designs upon the hôtel de

nesle  and of scozzone  who knew nothing of them 



the whole week passed away thus  and benvenuto cellini  having worked

conscientiously throughout the six days that composed it  and having

almost completed the clay model of his jupiter  donned his coat of mail

on the saturday about five o clock  buttoned his doublet over it  and 

bidding ascanio accompany him  bent his steps toward the hôtel de

nesle  when they reached the spot  cellini made the circuit of the

walls  spying out the weak spots  and meditating his plan of siege 



the attack offered more than one difficulty  as the provost had said to

his friend marmagne  as ascanio had informed his master  and as

benvenuto was now able to see for himself  the château de nesle was

crenellated and machicolated  was defended by a double wall on the river

side  and furthermore by the city moats and ramparts on the side of the

pré aux clercs  it was one of those massive and imposing feudal

structures  which were equal to the task of defending themselves by

their mass alone  provided that the doors were securely fastened  and of

repelling without outside assistance the assaults of  tirelaines  and

 larroneurs   as they were called in those days  or of the king s men 

if need were  this was often the case at that interesting epoch  when

one was generally compelled to do police duty for himself 



having made his reconnaissance according to all the ancient and modern

rules of strategy  and deeming it to be his duty to summon the place to

surrender before laying siege to it  he knocked at the little door by

which ascanio had once entered  for him as for ascanio the small window

opened  but it was the martial countenance of an archer  instead of that

of the pacific gardener  which appeared in the opening 



 what do you want   the archer demanded of the stranger who dared to

knock at the door of the hôtel de nesle 



 to take possession of the hotel  which has been given to me  benvenuto

cellini   replied the goldsmith 



 very good   wait   rejoined the fellow  and he went at once to notify

messire d estourville  as he had been ordered to do 



a moment later he returned  accompanied by the provost  who did not show

himself  but stood listening  with bated breath  in a corner  surrounded

by part of his garrison  in order to judge the better of the gravity of

the affair 



 we do not know what you mean   said the archer 



 if that be so   said cellini   hand this document to messire le

prévôt  it is a certified copy of the deed of gift   and he passed the

parchment through the window 



the sergeant disappeared a second time  but as he had simply to put out

his hand to hand the copy to the provost  the window opened again almost

immediately 



 here is his answer   said the sergeant  passing through the bars the

parchment torn in pieces 



 very good   rejoined cellini with perfect tranquillity    au revoir   



he returned to his studio  highly gratified by the attention with which

ascanio had followed his scrutiny of the place  and the young man s

judicious suggestions as to the  coup de main  they were to attempt at

some time  and he assured his pupil that he would have made a

distinguished general  were it not that he was destined to become a

still more distinguished artist  which  in cellini s view  was

infinitely preferable 



the next morning the sun rose in all his glory  benvenuto had requested

his workmen to come to the studio  although it was sunday  and not one

of them failed to appear 



 my children   said the master   it is undoubtedly true that i engaged

you to work at the goldsmith s trade  and not to fight  but during the

two months that we have been together we have learned to know one

another so well that  in a serious emergency  i feel that i can count

upon you  as you all and always can count upon me  you know what i have

in contemplation  we are but poorly accommodated here  with but little

air and little space  and our elbows are too cramped to allow us to

undertake great works  or even to use the forge with any degree of

vigor  the king  in the presence of you all  deigned to bestow upon me a

larger and more commodious abode  but  as he has no leisure to bestow

upon trifling details  he left it to me to install myself therein  now 

the present possessor does not choose to give over to me this property

which his majesty has so generously presented to me  therefore we must

take it  the provost of paris  who retains possession in the face of his

majesty s order   it would seem that such things are of common

occurrence in this land   does not know the man with whom he has to do 

as soon as i am refused  i demand  as soon as i am resisted  i take by

force  are you disposed to assist me  i do not conceal from you that

there will be danger in so doing  there is a battle to be fought  there

are walls to be scaled  and other harmless amusements to be indulged in 

there is nothing to fear from the police or the patrol  because we act

by his majesty s authority  but it may mean death  my children 

therefore  let those who wish to go elsewhere do so without hesitation 

let those who wish to remain here not be ashamed to say as much  i ask

for none but bold and resolute hearts  if you leave me to go alone with

pagolo and ascanio  have no fear on our behalf  i know not how i shall

go to work  but i do know this  that i will not be disappointed for

that  but  by the blood of christ  if you lend me your hearts and your

arms  as i hope you will  woe to the provost and the provostry  now that

you are fully instructed in the matter  speak  will you follow me  



they all shouted with one voice   



 anywhere  master  wherever you choose to lead us  



 bravo  my children  then you are all in for the sport  



 all  



 then let the tempest howl   cried benvenuto   at last we are to have a

little diversion  i have been rusty long enough  up  up  brave hearts

and swords  ah  thank god  we are soon to give and receive a few lusty

blows  look you  my dear boys  look you  my gallant friends  we must arm

ourselves  we must agree upon a plan  let them be ready to look to

themselves  and  vive la joie   i will give you all that i possess in

the way of weapons  offensive and defensive  in addition to those that

are hanging on the wall  where every one can choose at will  ah  what we

really need is a good culverin  but there s its value in arquebuses 

hackbuts  pikes  swords  and daggers  and there are coats of mail

galore  and cuirasses and helmets  come  haste  haste  and let us dress

for the ball  the provost shall pay for the music  



 hurrah   cried all his companions 



thereupon the studio was the scene of a commotion  a tumult  wonderful

to look upon  the verve and enthusiasm of the master infected every

heart and every face  they tried on cuirasses  brandished swords  tested

the point of daggers  laughed and sang  as if a masquerade or festival

of some sort were in progress  benvenuto ran hither and thither  handing

a boot to this one  buckling the belt of another  and feeling the blood

course hotly and freely through his veins  as if this were the life he

truly loved 



the workmen meanwhile indulged in jokes at one another s expense 

commenting freely upon the bellicose demeanor and awkward attitudes of

their fellows 



 look  master   cried one of them   look at simon le gaucher  4  putting

his sword on the same side as we  on the right  man  on the right  



 see jehan   retorted simon   holding his halberd as he ll hold his

cross when he s a bishop  



 there s pagolo putting on a double coat of mail   said jehan 



 why not   replied pagolo   hermann the german is arraying himself like

a knight in the days of the emperor barbarossa  



in fact  the youth referred to by the appellation of hermann the german

 a somewhat pleonastic title  as his name alone was so distinctively

germanic in sound as to indicate that its owner belonged to some one of

the circles of the holy empire    hermann  we say  had covered himself

from head to foot with iron  and resembled one of the gigantic statues

which the sculptors of that artistic age were accustomed to carve upon

tombs 



benvenuto  although the physical strength of this redoubtable comrade

from beyond the rhine had become proverbial in the studio  remarked that

he would be likely to experience some difficulty in moving  being so

completely encased  and that his usefulness would certainly be lessened

rather than increased  hermann s only reply was to leap upon a table as

lightly as if he were clad in velvet  take down an enormous hammer  wave

it around his head  and strike the anvil three such terrific blows that

each of them drove it an inch into the ground  there was nothing to say

to such a reply  so benvenuto waved his hand and nodded his head

respectfully in token of satisfaction 



ascanio alone made his toilet apart from the others  he could not avoid

a feeling of uneasiness as to the results of the enterprise upon which

they were about to embark  for it might well be that colombe would not

forgive him for attacking her father  especially if the struggle should

lead to some grave catastrophe  and he would find himself farther

removed from her heart  although nearer to her eyes 



scozzone  half joyous  half anxious  wept one moment and laughed the

next  the change of location and the prospect of a battle were by no

means unpleasing to her  but as for blows and wounds  that was another

matter  the preparations for the combat made the frolicsome creature

dance for joy  but its possible results made the woman that was in her

tremble 



benvenuto at last noticed her  smiling and weeping at the same time  and

he went to her side 



 thou wilt remain here  scozzone  with ruperta   he said   and prepare

lint for the wounded  and a good dinner for those who come safely

through it  



 oh no  no   cried scozzone   oh pray let me go with you  with you i

have courage enough to defy the provost and all his myrmidons  but alone

here with ruperta i should die of anxiety and fear  



 oh  i could never consent to that   replied benvenuto   it would

trouble me too much to think that some mishap might befall thee  thou

wilt pray for us  dear child  while awaiting our return  



 listen  benvenuto   rejoined the maiden  as if struck by a sudden

thought   you understand  of course  that i cannot endure the thought of

remaining quiet here while you are fighting yonder  wounded  perhaps

dying  but there is a way of satisfying both of us  instead of praying

for your safety here in the studio  i will go and pray in the church

nearest to the spot  in that way i shall be out of danger  and shall

know the result immediately  whether it be a victory or a defeat  



 very well  so be it   replied benvenuto   it is understood  of course 

that we shall not go forth to kill others  or to be killed ourselves 

without first fulfilling the pious duty of listening to mass  we will go

together to the church of the grands augustins  which is nearer than any

other to the hôtel de nesle  and will leave thee there  little one  



these arrangements determined upon  and the preparations for the affray

at an end  they drank a glass of burgundy to the success of their

enterprise  to their weapons  offensive and defensive  they added

hammers  tongs  ladders  and ropes  and left the studio  not after the

manner of an army corps  but two by two  at sufficiently long intervals

not to attract attention  it was not that a  coup de main  was a more

unfrequent occurrence in those days than an  émeute  or a change of

ministry in these days of ours  but  truth to say  it was not customary

to select the sabbath day  or the hour of noon  for this sort of

diversion  and it required all benvenuto s audacity  reinforced by his

consciousness that right was on his side  to venture upon such an

undertaking 



one after another our heroes arrived at the grands augustins  and 

having given their weapons and tools into the charge of the sacristan 

who was a friend of simon le gaucher  they entered the church to listen

devoutly to the blessed sacrifice of the mass  and to implore god s help

in exterminating as many archers as possible 



truth compels us to state  however  that despite the gravity of the

impending crisis  despite his exemplary piety  and despite the

importance of the matters to which his prayers had reference  benvenuto

had no sooner entered the church than his actions indicated that his

mind was upon something very different  his distraction was due to the

fact that just behind him  but on the other side of the nave  sat a

young girl reading from an illuminated missal   a young girl so adorably

lovely that she might well have confused the thoughts of a saint  much

more of a sculptor  under such circumstances the artist sadly interfered

with the devotions of the christian  the gallant cellini could not

resist the desire to have some one to join him in his admiration  and as

catherine  who was at his left  would certainly have frowned upon his

inattention  he turned to ascanio  who was at his right  with the

purpose of bidding him turn his eyes toward the lovely picture 



but ascanio s eyes needed no bidding in that direction  from the moment

that he entered the church his gaze was riveted upon the maiden  and his

eyes never left her face 



benvenuto  seeing that he was absorbed in contemplation of the same

object  simply nudged him with his elbow 



 yes   said ascanio   yes  it is colombe  o master  is she not

beautiful  



it was indeed colombe  her father  not anticipating an attack at high

noon  had given her permission  not without some reluctance  to go to

the augustins to pray  colombe  it is true  was very earnest in her

request  for it was the only consolation that remained to her  dame

perrine was by her side 



 ah çà  who is colombe   was benvenuto s very natural query 



 ah  yes  you do not know her  colombe is the daughter of the provost 

messire d estourville himself  is she not beautiful   he said again 



 no   rejoined benvenuto   no  it s not colombe   t is hebe  ascanio 

the goddess of youth  the hebe whom my great king françois has ordered

at my hands  the hebe of whom i have dreamed  for whom i have prayed to

god  and who has come down from above in response to my prayer  



regardless of the incongruity of the idea of hebe reading her missal 

and pouring out her heart in prayer  benvenuto continued his hymn to

beauty simultaneously with his devotion and his military plans  the

goldsmith  the catholic  and the strategist predominated in his mind by

turns 



 our father who art in heaven  look  ascanio  what clean cut  expressive

features   thy kingdom come  thy will be done on earth as it is in

heaven  how fascinatingly graceful the undulating outline of her

figure   give us this day our daily bread  and thou sayest that such a

lovely child is the daughter of that rascally provost whom i propose to

exterminate with my own hand   and forgive us our trespasses  as we

forgive those who trespass against us  even though i have to burn down

the hôtel to do it  amen  



and benvenuto crossed himself  having no doubt that he had just

concluded a most expressive rendering of the lord s prayer 



the mass came to an end while he was still absorbed in these

heterogeneous ideas  which might seem somewhat profane in the case of a

man of different temperament at a different epoch  but which were

altogether natural in so reckless a nature as cellini s  at a time when

clement marot was putting the seven penitential psalms into gallant

verse 



as soon as the  ite  missa est   was pronounced  benvenuto and catherine

exchanged a warm grasp of the hand  then  while the girl  wiping away a

tear  remained on the spot where she was to await the result of the

combat  cellini and ascanio  their eyes still fixed upon colombe  who

had not once looked up from her book  went with their companions to take

a drop of holy water  after which they separated  to meet in a deserted

 cul de sac  about half way from the church to the hôtel de nesle 



catherine  in accordance with the prearranged plan  remained to the

celebration of high mass  as did colombe and dame perrine  who had

simply arrived a little early  and had listened to the first service

only as a preparation for the more solemn ceremony to follow  nor had

they any reason to suspect that benvenuto and his apprentices were upon

the point of cutting all the lines of communication with the house they

had so imprudently quitted 









ix





thrust and parry





the decisive moment had arrived  benvenuto divided his men into two

detachments  one was to attempt  by every possible means  to force the

door of the hôtel  the other was to cover the operations of the first 

and to keep from the walls  with arquebus shots or with their swords 

any of the besieged who might appear upon the battlements  or who might

attempt a sortie  benvenuto took command of this last detachment in

person  and selected our friend ascanio for his lieutenant  at the head

of the other he placed hermann  the good humored  gallant german  who

could flatten an iron bar with a hammer  and a man with his fist  he

chose for his second in command little jehan  a rascal of fifteen years 

as active as a squirrel  mischievous as a monkey  and impudent as a

page  for whom the goliath had conceived a very deep affection  for the

reason  doubtless  that the playful youngster was forever tormenting

him  little jehan proudly took his place beside his captain  to the

great chagrin of pagolo  who in his double cuirass was not unlike the

statue of the commandeur in the rigidity of his movements 



having thus made his dispositions  and reviewed his men and inspected

their weapons for the last time  benvenuto addressed a few words to the

brave fellows who were about to face danger  perhaps death  in his

cause  with such good will  then he grasped each man s hand  crossed

himself devoutly  and cried   forward  



the two parties at once took up their line of march  and  skirting the

quai des augustins  which was deserted at that hour in that spot  they

very soon arrived at the hôtel de nesle 



thereupon benvenuto  unwilling to attack his enemy without first going

through all the formalities prescribed by custom in such cases  went

forward alone  waving a white handkerchief at the end of his sword  to

the same small door as before  and knocked  as before  he was questioned

through the barred opening as to the object of his visit  benvenuto

repeated the same formula  saying that he had come to take possession of

the château given him by the king  but he was less fortunate than on

the former occasion  in that he was not honored with any reply at all 



thereupon  facing the door  he exclaimed  in loud  distinct tones   



 to thee  robert d estourville  provost of paris  do i  benvenuto

cellini  goldsmith  sculptor  painter  and engineer  make known that his

majesty françois i  has in his good pleasure  as it was his right to

do  given to me absolutely the grand nesle  as thou dost insolently

maintain thy hold upon it  and  in contravention of the royal will  dost

refuse to deliver it to me  i hereby declare to thee  robert

d estourville  seigneur de villebon  provost of paris  that i have come

to take possession of the grand nesle by force  defend thyself

therefore  and  if evil comes of thy refusal  know that thou wilt be

held answerable therefor on earth and in heaven  before man and before

god  



with that benvenuto paused  and waited  but not a sound came from behind

the walls  he thereupon loaded his arquebus  and ordered his men to make

ready their weapons  then  assembling the leaders hermann  ascanio  and

jehan in council  he said to them   



 you see  my children  that it is not possible to avoid the conflict 

now it is for us to decide in what way we shall begin the attack  



 i will break in the door   said hermann   and do you follow me in 

that s all  



 with what will you do it  my samson   queried cellini 



hermann looked about and saw on the quay a piece of timber which four

ordinary men would have found it difficult to lift 



 with that beam   he said 



he walked to where it lay  coolly picked it up  placed it under his arm 

and fixed it there like a rain in its socket  then returned to his

general 



meanwhile a crowd was beginning to collect  and benvenuto  excited

thereby  was on the point of giving orders for the attack to begin  when

the captain of the king s archers  notified doubtless by some

conservative citizen  appeared at the corner of the street  accompanied

by five or six mounted men  this captain was a friend of the provost 

and although he knew perfectly well what was toward  he rode up to

benvenuto  hoping to intimidate him doubtless  and while his people

checked hermann s advance  he said   



 what is your desire  and why do you thus disturb the peace of the

city  



 the man who really disturbs the peace   replied cellini   is he who

refuses to obey the king s orders  not he who executes them  



 what do you mean   inquired the captain 



 i mean that i hold a deed in due form  delivered to me by messire de

neufville  secretary of the royal treasury  wherein his majesty grants

to me the hôtel du grand nesle  but the people who are in possession

refuse to recognize this deed  and thereby keep me from my own  now in

one way or another  i have got it into my head that  since scripture

says that we must render unto cæsar the things that are cæsar s 

benvenuto cellini is entitled to take what belongs to benvenuto

cellini  



 yes  and instead of preventing us from taking possession of our

property  you ought to lend us a hand   cried pagolo 



 be silent  rascal   said benvenuto  stamping angrily   i have no need

of anybody s assistance  dost thou understand  



 you are right in theory  but wrong in practice   rejoined the captain 



 how may that be   demanded benvenuto  who felt that the blood was

beginning to rise in his cheeks 



 you are right to wish to enter into possession of your property  but

you are wrong to undertake to do it in this way  for you will not gain

much  i promise you  fighting walls with your swords  if i were to give

you a little friendly advice  it would be to apply to the officers of

justice  and carry your grievance to the provost of paris  for example 

with that  adieu  and good luck to you  



and the captain of the king s archers rode away with a sneering laugh 

whereupon the crowd laughed too 



 he laughs best who laughs last   said benvenuto cellini   forward 

hermann  forward  



hermann took up his joist once more  and while cellini  ascanio  and two

or three of the most skilful marksmen of the party  arquebus in hand 

stood in readiness to fire upon the wall  he rushed forward like a

living catapult against the small door  which they deemed to be easier

to burst in than the large one 



but when he approached the wall a shower of stones began to rain down

upon him  although no defenders could be seen  for the provost had

ordered stones to be piled on top of the wall  and it was necessary only

to push lightly against the piles to send them down upon the heads of

the besiegers 



the latter  being thus warmly received  recoiled a step or two  but 

although taken entirely by surprise by this alarming method of defence 

no one was wounded save pagolo  he was so overburdened with his double

cuirass that he could not fall back so quickly as the others  and was

wounded in the heel 



hermann himself was no more disturbed by this shower of pebbles than an

oak tree by a hail storm  and kept on to the door  where he at once set

to work and began to deal such blows against it that it soon became

evident that  stout as it was  it could not long withstand such

treatment 



benvenuto and his men meanwhile stood ready with their arquebuses to

fire upon anybody who might appear upon the wall  but no one appeared 

the grand nesle seemed to be defended by an invisible garrison  and

benvenuto raged inwardly at his inability to do anything to assist the

dauntless german  suddenly he happened to glance at the old tour de

nesle  which stood by itself  as we have said  on the other side of the

quay  and bathed its feet in the seine 



 wait  hermann   cried cellini   wait  my good fellow  the hôtel de

nesle is ours as surely as my name is benvenuto cellini  and i am a

goldsmith by trade  



motioning to ascanio and his two companions to follow him  he ran to the

tower  while hermann  in obedience to his orders  stepped back out of

range of the stones  and awaited the fulfilment of the general s

promise  leaning upon his timber as a swiss would lean upon his halberd 



as benvenuto anticipated  the provost had neglected to station a guard

in the old tower  so that he took possession of it unopposed  and 

running up the stairs  four at a leap  reached the summit in a moment 

the terrace overlooked the walls of the grand nesle  as a steeple

overlooks a town  so that the besieged  who a moment before were

sheltered by their ramparts  suddenly found themselves entirely

unprotected 



the report of an arquebus and the hissing of a bullet  followed by the

fall of an archer  warned the provost that the face of affairs was in

all probability about to change 



at the same moment hermann  realizing that he would now have a free

field  resumed his joist  and began to batter away again at the door 

which the besieged had strengthened somewhat during the momentary

suspension of hostilities 



the crowd  with the marvellous instinct of self possession always

noticeable in such bodies  realized that shooting was to form part of

the entertainment  and that spectators of the tragedy about to be

enacted were likely to be splashed with blood  and they no sooner heard

the report of benvenuto s arquebus and the cry of the wounded archer

than they dispersed like a flock of pigeons 



a single individual remained 



this was no other than our friend  jacques aubry  the student  who had

kept the appointment made the preceding sunday with ascanio  in the hope

of enjoying his game of tennis 



he had but to east a glance over the battle field to understand what was

going on 



it is not difficult to divine the determination arrived at by jacques

aubry  from what we have already seen of his character  to play at

tennis or with fire arms was equally sport to him  and as he guessed

that the besiegers were most likely to be his friends  he enlisted under

their banner 



 well  my boys   he said  walking up to the group which was waiting for

the door to be burst in to rush into the citadel   we are having a bit

of a siege  are we  peste  you re not attacking a cabin  and it s a

good deal of an undertaking for so few of you to try to take a strong

place like this  



 we are not alone   said pagolo  who was dressing his heel  and he

pointed to benvenuto and his three or four companions  who were keeping

up such a well sustained fire upon the wall that the stones were falling

much less freely than at first 



 i see  i see  master achilles   said jacques aubry   for you are like

him in being wounded in the heel  in addition to a thousand other points

of similarity  no doubt  i see  yes  there s my friend ascanio  and the

master doubtless  on top of the tower yonder  



 very true   said pagolo 



 and that fellow banging away at the door so lustily is one of you also 

isn t he  



 that s hermann   said little jehan proudly 



 peste  how he goes on   said the student   i must go and congratulate

him  



he sauntered along with his hands in his pockets  regardless of the

bullets whistling above his head  to the brave german  who kept at his

task with the regularity of a machine 



 do you need anything  my dear goliath   said jacques aubry   i am at

your service  



 i am thirsty   replied hermann  without pausing in his work 



 peste  i can well believe it  that s thirsty work you re doing there 

and i wish i had a cask of beer to offer you  



 water   said hermann   water  



 do you mean that mild beverage will satisfy you  so be it  the

river is at hand  and you shall be served in a moment  



jacques ran to the river  filled his helmet with water  and took it to

the german  he leaned his beam against the wall  swallowed at a draught

all that the helmet contained  and handed it back to the student empty 



 thanks   he said  and  taking up the beam once more  he resumed his

work 



an instant later he said   go and tell the master to be in readiness 

for we are getting on famously here  



jacques aubry started for the tower  and in a very few moments he stood

between ascanio and benvenuto  who were keeping up such a brisk and

effective fire that they had already shot down two or three men  and the

provost s archers were beginning to  think twice before showing

themselves upon the walls 



meanwhile  as hermann had sent word to benvenuto  the door was beginning

to yield  and the provost resolved to make one last effort  he cheered

on his men to such good purpose that the stones began to rain down once

more  but two or three arquebus shots speedily calmed anew the ardor of

the besieged  who  despite all messire robert s promises and

remonstrances  coyly remained out of range  thereupon messire robert

himself appeared  alone  carrying in his hands an enormous stone  and

made ready to hurl it down upon hermann s head 



but benvenuto was not the man to allow his retainer to be taken by

surprise  as soon as he caught sight of the provost rashly venturing

where no one else ventured to go  he put his weapon to his shoulder  it

would have been all up with messire robert  had not ascanio  just as

cellini pulled the trigger  thrown up the barrel with a quick motion of

his hand accompanied by a sharp exclamation  so that the bullet whistled

harmlessly through the air  ascanio had recognized colombe s father 



as benvenuto turned furiously upon him to demand an explanation  the

stone  thrown with all the force the provost could impart to it  fell

full upon hermann s helmet  even the enormous strength of the modern

titan was not equal to the task of sustaining such a blow  he relaxed

his hold of the timber  threw out his arms as if seeking something to

cling to  and  finding nothing within reach  fell to the ground

unconscious  with a terrible crash 



besieged and besiegers simultaneously set up a shout  little jehan and

three or four comrades who were near hermann ran to him to carry him

away from the wall  and look to his injuries  but the large and small

doors of the hôtel de nesle opened at the same moment  and the provost 

at the head of twelve or fifteen men  darted upon the wounded man 

cutting and slashing vigorously  as did all his followers  so that jehan

and his comrades were forced to retreat  although benvenuto was shouting

to them to hold their ground  and that he would come and help them  the

provost seized the opportunity  eight of his men lifted hermann  who was

still unconscious  by the arms and legs  and seven took up a position to

protect their retreat  so that  while cellini  ascanio  and their three

or four comrades on the terrace of the tower were hurrying down the four

or five flights of stairs which lay between them and the street  hermann

and his bearers re entered the grand nesle  when cellini  arquebus in

hand  appeared at the door of the tower  the door of the hôtel was just

closing behind the last of the provost s men at arms 



there was no disguising the fact that this was a check  and a serious

check at that  cellini  ascanio  and their comrades had  it is true 

disabled three or four of the besieged  but the loss of these three or

four men was much less disastrous to the provost  than was the loss of

hermann to cellini 



the besiegers were dazed for a moment 



suddenly ascanio and cellini looked at each other  as if by a common

impulse 



 i have a plan   said cellini  looking to the left  that is to say 

toward the city 



 and so have i   ascanio rejoined  looking to the right  that is to say 

toward the fields 



 i have devised a plan to bring the garrison out of the castle  



 and i a plan to open the door for you  if you do bring them out  



 how many men do you need  



 a single one will suffice  



 choose  



 will you come with me  jacques aubry   said ascanio 



 to the end of the world  my dear fellow  to the end of the world  but i

shouldn t be sorry to have some sort of a weapon  the end of a sword for

instance  or a suspicion of a dagger  four or five inches of steel to

feel my way with if occasion requires  



 oh  take pagolo s sword   said ascanio   he can t use it  for he s

nursing his heel with his right hand and crossing himself with the

other  



 and here s my own dagger to complete your outfit   said cellini 

 strike with it all you please  young man  but do not leave it in the

wound  it would be altogether too handsome a present to the wounded man 

for the hilt was carved by myself  and is worth a hundred golden crowns 

if it is worth a sou  



 and the blade   queried jacques aubry   the hilt is very valuable  no

doubt  but at such a time the blade is of the greatest importance to my

mind  



 the blade is priceless   rejoined benvenuto   with it i killed my

brother s murderer  



 bravo   cried the student   come  ascanio  let s be off  



 i am ready   said ascanio  winding five or six lengths of rope around

his body  and putting one of the ladders over his shoulder    i am

ready  



the two venturesome youths walked along the quay a hundred yards or

thereabouts  then turned to the left  and disappeared around the corner

of the wall of the grand nesle  behind the city moat 



let us leave ascanio to carry out his scheme  and follow cellini in the

development of his 



the objects upon which his eyes rested  when  as we have said  he looked

toward the left  that is  in the direction of the city  were two women 

standing amid a group of timid spectators at some little distance   two

women  in whom he thought he recognized the provost s daughter and her

governess 



they were in fact colombe and dame perrine  who  after hearing mass  set

out to return to the petit nesle  and had come to a stand still in the

crowd  trembling with alarm on account of what they had heard of the

siege that was in progress  and of what they saw with their own eyes 



but colombe no sooner perceived that there was a momentary cessation of

hostilities  which left the road open for her  than  heedless of the

entreaties of dame perrine  who begged her not to risk her safety in the

tumult  she went forward resolutely  impelled by her anxiety for her

father  and leaving dame perrine entirely free to follow her or to

remain where she was  as the duenna was really deeply attached to her

charge  she determined to accompany her  notwithstanding her fright 



they left the group just as ascanio and jacques aubry turned the corner

of the wall 



now benvenuto cellini s plan may be divined 



as soon as he saw the two women coming toward him  he himself stepped

forward to meet them  and gallantly offered his arm to colombe 



 have no fear  madame   he said   if you will deign to accept my arm i

will escort you to your father  



colombe hesitated  but dame perrine seized the arm on her side which

benvenuto had forgotten to offer her 



 take his arm  my dear  take it   she said   and let us accept this

noble knight s protection  look  look  there is monsieur le prévôt 

leaning over the wall  he is anxious about us  no doubt  



colombe took benvenuto s arm  and the three walked to within a step or

two of the door 



there cellini stopped  and said to the provost in a loud voice  making

sure that colombe s arm and dame perrine s were safely within his own   



 monsieur le prévôt  your daughter who is here desires to enter  i

trust that you will open the door to her  unless you prefer to leave so

charming a hostage in your enemy s hands  



twenty times within two hours the provost  behind his ramparts  had

thought of his daughter  whom he had so imprudently allowed to go out 

being in considerable doubt as to the possibility of admitting her

again  he was hoping that she would be warned in time  and would be wise

enough to go to the grand châtelet and await results  when he saw

cellini leave his companions and go to meet two women  in whom he

recognized colombe and dame perrine 



 the little fool   he muttered beneath his breath   but i can t leave

her in the midst of these miscreants  



he opened the wicket  and showed his face behind the grating 



 well   said he   what are your terms  



 these   said benvenuto   i will allow madame colombe and her governess

to enter  but only on condition that you come forth with all your men 

and we will then decide our dispute by a fair fight in the open  they

who remain in possession of the battle field shall have the hôtel de

nesle    vœ victis    as your compatriot brennus said  



 i accept   said the provost   on one condition  



 what is it  



 that you and your people stand back to give my daughter time to come in

and my archers time to go out  



 agreed   said cellini   but do you come out first  and let madame

colombe go in afterward  when she is safely inside  you will throw the

key over the wall to her  and thus leave yourself no opportunity to

retreat  



 agreed   said the provost 



 your word  



 on the faith of a gentleman  and yours  



 on the faith of benvenuto cellini  



these terms being agreed upon  the door opened  and the provost s

retainers filed out  and drew up in two rows before the door  messire

d estourville at their head  they were nineteen in all  on the other

side  benvenuto  without ascanio  hermann  and jacques aubry  had but

eight men remaining  and of these simon le gaucher was wounded   luckily

in the right hand  but benvenuto was not given to counting his foes  it

will be remembered that he did not hesitate to attack pompeo

single handed  although he was attended by a dozen sbirri  he was only

too glad  therefore  to abide by his agreement  for he desired nothing

so much as a general and decisive action 



 you may go in now  madame   he said to his fair prisoner 



colombe flew across the space which lay between the two camps as swiftly

as the bird whose name she bore  and threw herself panting into the

provost s arms 



 father  father   she cried  weeping   in heaven s name  do not expose

yourself  



 go inside   said the provost sharply  taking her by the arm  and

leading her to the door    t is your folly that reduces us to this

extremity  



colombe passed through the door  followed by dame perrine  to whom fear

had lent  if not wings  as to her lovely ward  at least legs  which she

thought she had lost ten years before 



the provost closed the door behind them 



 the key  the key   cried cellini 



true to his promise  the provost took the key from the lock and threw it

over the wall  so that it fell into the courtyard 



 and now   cried benvenuto  rushing upon the provost and his troop 

 every man for himself  and god for us all  



a terrible struggle ensued  for before the provost s people had time to

lower their weapons and fire  benvenuto with his seven workmen was in

their midst  slashing to right and left with the terrible sword which he

handled in such masterly fashion  and which  forged by his own hand  met

few coats of mail or breastplates able to resist it  the soldiers

thereupon cast aside their useless arquebuses  drew their swords  and

began to cut and thrust in return  but  despite their numbers and their

gallantry  in less time than it takes to write the words  they were

scattered all about the square  and two or three of the bravest  wounded

so severely that they could tight no longer  were forced to fall back 



the provost saw the danger  and being a brave man  who in his time had

achieved some fame as a fighting man  he rushed forward to confront this

redoubtable benvenuto cellini  whom nobody seemed able to withstand 



 to me   he cried   to me  infamous robber  and let us decide the

affair  what say you  



 oh  i could ask nothing better   replied benvenuto   if you will bid

your people not to interfere with us  i am your man  



 stand where you are   said the provost to his men 



 let not one of you stir   said cellini to his 



and the combatants on either side stood rooted in their places  silent

and motionless  like the homeric warriors  who ceased their own fighting

in order to miss no part of a contest between two renowned chiefs 



thereupon the provost and cellini  each of whom already held his naked

sword in his hand  attacked each other at the same instant 



the provost was a clever fencer  but cellini s skill in that direction

was of the very first order  for ten or twelve years past the provost

had not once had occasion to draw his sword  on the other hand  during

those same ten or twelve years hardly a day had passed that benvenuto

had not had or made an occasion to draw his  at the outset  therefore 

the provost  who had counted a little too much upon his own prowess 

became conscious of his enemy s superiority 



cellini  for his part  meeting with a resistance which he hardly

anticipated from a man of the robe  exerted all the energy  activity 

and cunning of which he was capable  it was a marvellous thing to watch

his sword  which  like the triple sting of a serpent  threatened the

head and the heart at the same instant  flying from place to place  and

hardly giving his adversary time to parry  much less to make a single

thrust  and so the provost  realizing that he had to do with one

stronger than himself  began to give ground  still defending himself 

however  unluckily for messire robert  his back was toward the wall  so

that a very few steps brought him up against the door  for which he

instinctively aimed  although he was well aware that he had thrown the

key over the wall 



when he reached that point he felt that he was lost  and like a wild

boar at bay  he summoned all his strength  and delivered three or four

lusty blows in such rapid succession that it was benvenuto s turn to

parry  once indeed he was a second too late  and his adversary s blade

grazed his breast  despite the excellent coat of mail he wore  but  like

a wounded lion bent upon speedy vengeance  benvenuto  the moment that he

felt the sharp point of the sword  gathered himself for a spring  and

would have run the provost through with a deadly lunge  had not the door

behind him suddenly given way at that moment  so that messire

d estourville fell over backwards  and the sword came in contact with

the individual who had saved him by opening the door so unexpectedly 



but the result was different from what might have been expected  for the

wounded man said nothing  while benvenuto gave utterance to a terrible

cry  he had recognized ascanio in the man whom he had unintentionally

wounded  he had no eyes for hermann or for jacques aubry  who stood

behind his victim  like a madman  he threw his arms around the young

man s neck  seeking the wound with his eyes and his hand and his mouth 

and crying   



 slain  slain  slain by my hand  ascanio  my child  i have killed thee  

and roaring and weeping  as lions roar and weep 



meanwhile hermann extricated the provost  unharmed  from between

ascanio s and cellini s legs  and  taking him under his arm as he might

have done with a baby  deposited him in a little house where raimbault

kept his gardening tools  he locked the door upon him  drew his sword 

and assumed a posture indicative of his purpose to defend his prisoner

against any one who might undertake to recapture him 



jacques aubry made but one bound from the pavement to the top of the

wall  brandishing his dagger triumphantly  and shouting   blow 

trumpets  blow  the grand nesle is ours  



how all these surprising things had come to pass the reader will

discover in the following chapter 





 footnote 4  left handed  









x





of the advantage of fortified towns





the hôtel de nesle  on the side bounded by the pré aux clercs  was

doubly defended by its walls and by the city moat  so that on that side

it was considered impregnable  now ascanio very sensibly reflected that

it is seldom deemed necessary to guard what cannot be taken  and he

determined to make an attack upon the point where the besieged had not

thought of providing against one 



with that object in view he set out with his friend jacques aubry  not

dreaming that  as he disappeared in one direction  colombe would appear

in the other  and provide benvenuto with a means of compelling the

provost to adopt a course which he was most reluctant to adopt 



ascanio s scheme was very difficult of execution  and very dangerous in

its possible results  he proposed to cross a deep moat  scale a wall

twenty five feet high  and at the end perhaps fall into the midst of the

enemy  not till he arrived at the brink of the moat and of his

enterprise did he realize the difficulty of crossing the one and

carrying through the other  and then his determination  firm as it was

at the outset  wavered for an instant 



jacques aubry halted some ten or twelve paces behind his friend  and

stood tranquilly gazing from the wall to the moat  having measured them

both with his eye  he said   



 i beg you  my dear fellow  to have the kindness to inform me why you

bring me hither  unless it be to fish for frogs  ah  yes   you glance at

your ladder  very good  i understand  but your ladder is only twelve

feet long  while the wall is twenty five feet high and the moat ten

wide  which makes a difference of twenty three feet  if my reckoning is

correct  



ascanio was taken aback for a moment by this unanswerable arithmetic 

but suddenly he cried  striking his forehead with his hand   



 ah  i have an idea  look  



 where  



 there   said ascanio   there  



 that s not an idea you are pointing at   rejoined the student   but an

oak tree  



there was in truth a huge oak growing near the outer edge of the moat 

the upper branches of which gazed inquisitively over the wall of the

séjour de nesle 



 what  don t you understand   cried ascanio 



 yes  yes  i begin to see through it now  yes  it s the very thing  i

see it all  the oak and the wall form part of the arch of a bridge which

your ladder will complete  but the abyss yawns beneath  my friend  and

an abyss full of mud  the devil  we mustn t forget that  i am wearing

my best clothes  and simonne s husband is beginning to grumble about

giving me credit  



 help me to hoist the ladder   said ascanio   that s all i ask of you  



 aha   said the student   and i am to stay below  thanks  



each of them seized a branch  and they were soon in the tree  by their

united strength they succeeded in pulling the ladder up after them to

the top of the tree  where they lowered it like a drawbridge  and found

to their intense satisfaction that while one end rested firmly upon a

stout branch  the other end extended two or three feet beyond the wall 



 but when we are upon the wall  what are we to do   aubry inquired 



 why  when we re upon the wall we will pull the ladder after us  and go

down by it  



 very good  there is only one trifling difficulty  and that is that the

wall is twenty five feet high  and the ladder only twelve  



 i have provided for that   said ascanio  unwinding the rope from his

body  he then made one end fast to the trunk of the tree  and threw the

other over the wall 



 ah  great man  i understand you   cried aubry   and i am proud and

happy to break my neck with you  



 very well  what do you propose to do  



 go across   and aubry prepared to cross the space that lay between them

and the wall 



 no  no   said ascanio   it is my place to go first  



 which finger is wet   said aubry  holding out his hand to his companion

with two fingers open and two closed 



 so be it   said ascanio  touching one of the two closed fingers 



 you have won   said aubry   go on  but keep cool  don t get excited  



 never fear  



ascanio started out upon the flying bridge  while jacques aubry steadied

it by sitting upon the end  the ladder was a frail support  but the

daring youth was light  the student  hardly daring to breathe  thought

that he wavered for an instant  but he passed quickly over the narrow

space that separated him from the wall  and arrived there safe and

sound  he was still in very great danger if any of the besieged should

happen to espy him  but his anticipations were verified 



 no one in sight   he shouted to his companion    no one  



 if that is so   said aubry   on with the dance  



and he ventured upon the narrow  trembling path  while ascanio  putting

his whole weight upon the other end of the ladder  repaid the service

rendered him  as he was as light and as active as ascanio  he was at his

side in an instant 



both of them sat astride the wall and drew the ladder across  they then

made fast the other end of the rope to it  and lowered it  swinging it

out so that the lower end would rest on the ground at a safe distance

from the wall  lastly  ascanio  who had won the privilege of making

experiments  took the rope in both hands and slid down until his feet

rested upon the topmost round of the ladder  another second and he was

on the ground 



jacques aubry followed him with similar good fortune  and the two

friends found themselves in the garden 



it was plainly advisable for them to act at once  all their manœuvring

had taken considerable time  and ascanio was fearful lest his absence

and aubry s had been prejudicial to the master s interests  drawing

their swords as they ran  they hastened to the door leading into the

first courtyard  where the garrison should be  assuming that they had

not changed their position  when they reached the door  ascanio put his

eye to the keyhole  and saw that the courtyard was empty 



 benvenuto has succeeded   he cried   the garrison has gone out  the

hotel is ours   and he tried to open the door  which proved to be

locked 



both of the young men put forth all their strength in an effort to force

it 



 this way  this way   exclaimed a voice  which found an echo in

ascanio s heart   this way  monsieur  



he turned and saw colombe at a window on the ground floor  in two bounds

he was at her side 



 aha   exclaimed jacques aubry  following him   it seems that we have

friends in the citadel  aha  you didn t tell me that  my boy  



 oh  save my father  monsieur ascanio   cried colombe  without any

indication of surprise at the young man s appearance  and as if his

presence were the most natural thing in the world   they are fighting

outside  do you know  and it s all for me  all on my account  o mon

dieu  mon dieu  grant that they kill not one another  



 have no fear   said ascanio  darting into the apartment  which had a

door leading into the little courtyard   have no fear  i will answer for

everything  



 have no fear   said jacques aubry  following at his heels   have no

fear  we will answer for everything  



as he entered the room ascanio heard his name called a second time  but

by a voice much less musical than the other 



 who calls me   he said 



 i  my young friend   the same voice replied  with a most pronounced

teutonic accent 



 pardieu   cried aubry    t is our goliath  what the deuce are you doing

in that hen roost   he added  looking through the window of the

gardener s shed  at which he saw a face which he recognized as

hermann s 



 i haf found myself here  but i know not how i haf here come  draw the

bolt  that i may go and fight  quick  quick  quick  my hand itches  



 there you are   said the student  rendering hermann the service he

requested 



meanwhile ascanio was hurrying toward the door opening on the quay 

where he could hear a tremendous clashing of swords  when naught but the

thickness of the wood separated him from the combatants  he feared that 

if he showed himself at that moment  he might fall into the hands of his

enemies  so he first looked out through the grated wicket  there he saw

cellini facing him  eager  excited and thirsting for the blood of his

antagonist  and realized that messire robert was lost  he picked up the

key  which lay on the ground  opened the door quickly  and thinking of

nothing save his promise to colombe  received in his shoulder the blow

which  but for him  would inevitably have transfixed the provost 



we have already witnessed the result of that occurrence  benvenuto  in

desperation  threw himself upon ascanio s neck  hermann imprisoned the

provost in the same cage from which he had just been set free himself 

and jacques aubry  perched upon the rampart  flapped his wings and

crowed lustily in honor of the victory 



the victory was in very truth complete  the provost s people  when their

master was made prisoner  did not even try to dispute it  but laid down

their arms 



accordingly the goldsmiths all entered the courtyard of the grand nesle 

thenceforth their property  and secured the door behind them  leaving

the archers and sergeants outside 



benvenuto  however  took no part in the latter proceedings  he still

held ascanio in his arms  having removed his coat of mail  torn away his

doublet  and finally reached the wound  and was stanching the flow of

blood with his handkerchief 



 my ascanio  my child   he said again and again   wounded  wounded by

me  what will thy mother in heaven say  forgive me  stefana  forgive me 

art thou in pain  tell me  does my hand hurt thee  will this accursed

blood never stop  a surgeon  quickly  pray  will not some one call a

surgeon  



jacques aubry ran out of the courtyard at the top of his speed 



 it is nothing  dear master  it is nothing   said ascanio   a mere

scratch on my arm   don t feel so terribly  for i assure you it s

nothing  



the surgeon  brought to the hotel by jacques aubry five minutes later 

confirmed ascanio s assurance that the wound was not dangerous  although

quite deep  and at once set about bandaging it 



 ah  what a weight you lift from my heart   said cellini   then i am not

thy murderer  dear child  but what is the matter  my ascanio  thy pulse

is beating madly  and the blood rushing to thy face  o monsieur le

chirurgien  we must take him away from here   the fever is laying hold

of him  



 no  no  master   said ascanio   on the contrary i feel much better 

leave me here  leave me here  i implore you  



 my father   suddenly inquired a voice behind benvenuto  which made him

jump   what have you done with my father  



benvenuto turned and saw colombe  pale and rigid  seeking the provost

with her glance  as she asked for him with her voice 



 oh  he is safe and sound  mademoiselle  safe and sound  thanks be to

heaven   cried ascanio 



 thanks be to this poor boy  who received the blow intended for him  

said benvenuto   for you may truly say that this gallant fellow saved

your life  monsieur le prévôt   how s this  where are you  messire

robert   exclaimed cellini  looking about for the provost  whose

disappearance he could not understand 



 he is here  master   said hermann 



 where  pray  



 here  in the little prison  



 o monsieur benvenuto   cried colombe  darting to the shed with a

gesture of mingled entreaty and reproach 



 open  hermann   said cellini 



hermann obeyed  and the provost appeared in the doorway  somewhat

humiliated by his misadventure  colombe threw herself into his arms 



 o father  father   she cried   are you not wounded  has no harm

befallen you   and as she spoke she looked at ascanio 



 no   said the provost in his harsh voice   no  thank heaven  nothing

has happened to me  



 and  and    queried colombe  in a faltering tone   is it true that this

youth   



 i cannot deny that he arrived at just the right time  



 yes   interposed cellini   yes  at the right time to receive the sword

thrust which i intended for you  monsieur le prévôt  yes  mademoiselle

colombe  yes   he added   you owe your father s life to this brave

fellow  and if monsieur le prévôt doesn t proclaim it from the

housetops  he is an ingrate as well as a liar  



 i trust that his rescuer will not have to pay too dearly for his

gallantry   rejoined colombe  blushing at her own audacity 



 o mademoiselle   cried ascanio   i would gladly have shed all my blood

in such a cause  



 well  well  messire le prévôt   said cellini   see what tender

emotions you have caused to spring up  but ascanio may not be able to

bear the excitement  the bandage is in place  and it would be well for

him  i think  to take a little rest now  



what benvenuto had said to the provost of the service rendered him by

the wounded man was no more than the truth  and as every truth has an

innate strength of its own  the provost in his heart could but admit

that he owed his life to ascanio  he therefore put a good face on the

matter  and approached the wounded man  saying   



 young man  an apartment in my hotel is at your service  



 in your hotel  messire robert   exclaimed cellini  with a laugh  for

his good humor returned as his anxiety on ascanio s account vanished 

 in your hotel  why  do you really wish to begin the battle over again  



 what   cried the provost   do you claim the right to turn my daughter

and myself out of doors  



 by no means  messire  you now occupy the petit nesle  very good  keep

the petit nesle  and let us live on such terms as good neighbors should 

be good enough  messire  to make no opposition to ascanio s being at

once made comfortable in the grand nesle  where we will join him this

evening  thereafter  if you prefer war   



 o father   cried colombe 



 no  peace   said the provost 



 there can be no peace without conditions  monsieur le prévôt  do me

the honor to accompany me to the grand nesle  or the favor to receive me

at the petit  and we will draw up our treaty  



 i will go with you  monsieur   said the provost 



 so be it  



 mademoiselle   said d estourville then to his daughter   be good enough

to return to your apartments and await my return there  



colombe  notwithstanding the harsh tone in which this command was

uttered  presented her forehead to her father to kiss  and with a

courtesy addressed to everybody present  so that ascanio might come in

for a share of it  she withdrew 



ascanio followed her with his eyes until she disappeared  as there was

nothing further to detain him in the courtyard  he asked to be taken

inside  hermann thereupon took him under the arms as if he were a child 

and transported him to the grand nesle 



 on my word  messire robert   said benvenuto  who had also looked after

the maiden while she was in sight   on my word  you were very judicious

to send my late prisoner away  and i thank you for the precaution   on

my honor i do  i am free to say that mademoiselle colombe s presence

might have been prejudicial to my interests by making me too weak  and

too willing to forget that i am a victor  to remember simply that i am

an artist   that is to say  a lover of every perfect form and of all

divine beauty  



messire d estourville acknowledged the compliment by a decidedly

ungracious contortion of his features  he followed the goldsmith 

however  without outwardly manifesting his ill humor  but mumbling dire

threats beneath his breath  cellini  to put the finishing touch to his

mortification  begged him to go over his new abode with him  the

invitation was conveyed in such courteous terms that it was impossible

to decline  the provost therefore accompanied his neighbor  who showed

him no mercy  and left not a corner of the garden nor a room in the

château unvisited 



 ah  this is truly magnificent   said benvenuto when they had finished

the tour of inspection  during which they were actuated by widely

opposed emotions   now  monsieur le prévôt  i can understand and

excuse your repugnance to give up this property  but i need not say that

you will be most welcome whenever you may choose  as to day  to do me

the honor of calling upon me in my poor abode  



 you forget  monsieur  that i am here to day for no other purpose than

to listen to your conditions and state my own  i am ready to listen  



 how so  messire robert  on the contrary  i am at your service  but if

you choose to allow me first to make known my wishes to you  you will

then be free to give expression to your own  



 say on  



 first of all  the one essential clause  



 what is that  



 it is this   



 article i   messire robert d estourville doth concede benvenuto

cellini s right to the property called the grand nesle  doth freely

abandon it to him  and doth renounce all claim thereto forever  for

himself and his heirs  



 accepted   said the provost   but if it should please the king to take

from you what he has now taken from me  and to give to some other what

he has now given to you  i am not to be held responsible  



 ouais   said cellini   there s some mischievous mental reservation

hidden in that  monsieur le prévôt  but no matter  i shall know how to

retain what i have won  let us pass to the next  



  t is my turn   said the provost 



 that is no more than fair  



 article ii   benvenuto cellini agrees to make no attack upon the

petit nesle  which is and is to remain the property of robert

d estourville  furthermore  he will not even attempt to gain a footing

there as a neighbor  and under the guise of friendship  



 very good   said benvenuto   although the clause is by no means

conceived in kindness  but if the door is thrown open to me i shall not

show myself so devoid of courtesy as to refuse to enter  



 i will give orders to avert that possibility   retorted the provost 



 let us to the next  



 i continue   



 article iii   the first courtyard  between the grand and petit nesles 

shall be common to both estates  



 that is quite right   said benvenuto   and you will do me the justice

to believe that if mademoiselle colombe desires to go out  i shall not

keep her a prisoner  



 oh  never fear  my daughter will go in and out by a door which i

undertake to have cut in the wall  i simply wish to make sure of an

entrance for carriages and wagons  



 is that all  



 yes   replied messire robert   apropos   he added   i trust that you

will allow me to remove my furniture  



 that is no more than fair  your furniture is yours  as the grand nesle

is mine  now  messire le prévôt  let us add one more clause to the

treaty   a clause purely benevolent in its purpose  



 state it  



 article iv  and last   messire robert d estourville and benvenuto

cellini lay aside all ill will  and loyally and sincerely agree to abide

in peace  



 i accept the article  but only in so far as it does not bind me to bear

aid to you against those who may attack you  i agree to do nothing to

injure you  but i do not agree to make myself agreeable to you  



 as to that  monsieur le prévôt  you know perfectly well that i can

defend myself alone  do you not  if there is no objection now on your

part   added cellini  passing the pen to him   sign  monsieur le

prévôt  sign    i will sign   said the provost  suiting the action to

the word  and each of the contracting parties retained a copy of the

treaty 



this formality at an end  messire d estourville returned to the

petit nesle  being in great haste to scold poor colombe for her rash

expedition  colombe hung her head  and let him say what he chose  not

hearing a single word of his reproaches  for during all the time that

they endured the girl was engrossed by a single longing  to ask her

father for news of ascanio  but it was useless  try as hard as she

would  she could not force the wounded youth s name beyond her lips 



while these things were taking place on one side of the wall  on the

other side  catherine  who had been sent for from the church  made her

entry into the grand nesle  the fascinating madcap threw herself into

benvenuto s arms  pressed ascanio s hand  complimented hermann  made

sport of pagolo  laughed  wept  sang  asked questions  all in the same

breath  she had suffered terribly  for the reports of fire arms had

reached her ears and interrupted her prayers again and again  but now

everything was all right  everybody had come out safe and sound from the

battle  save four dead and three wounded men  and scozzone s high

spirits did homage to both victory and victors 



when the uproar caused by catherine s arrival had subsided in some

measure  ascanio remembered the motive which brought the student to the

spot so opportunely  he turned to benvenuto and said   



 master  my comrade jacques aubry and i were to try our hands at a game

of tennis to day  in good sooth  i am hardly in condition to be his

partner  as our friend hermann says  he has assisted us so gallantly in

our undertaking  however  that i venture to beg you to take my place  



 with all my heart   said benvenuto   but you must look to yourself 

master jacques aubry  



 i will try  i will try  messire  



 we shall sup together afterward  and you know that the victor will be

expected to drink two bottles more than his vanquished opponent  



 which means that i shall be carried home dead drunk  master benvenuto 

 vive la joie   this suits me  ah  the devil  there s simonne waiting

for me  too  pshaw  i had to wait for her last sunday  it s her turn

to day  so much the worse for her  



with that the two seized balls and rackets  and hied them to the garden 









xi





owls  magpies  and nightingales





as this was the blessed sabbath day  benvenuto did nothing more than

play tennis  rest after playing  and inspect his new property  but on

the following day the work of moving began  and was fully completed two

days later  by virtue of the assistance of his new companions  on the

third day benvenuto resumed his modelling as calmly as if nothing had

happened 



when the provost realized that he was definitively vanquished  when he

learned that benvenuto s studio  tools  and workmen were actually

installed at the grand nesle  rage took possession of him once more  and

he began to plot and plan for vengeance  he was in one of his most

wrathful moments when the vicomte de marmagne surprised him on the

morning of this same third day  wednesday  marmagne could not resist the

longing to gratify his vanity by triumphing over the sorrows and

reverses of his friends  as every man who is a coward and an idiot loves

to do 



 well   he said   i told you so  my dear provost  



 ah  is it you  viscount  good morning  



 well  was i right or wrong  



 alas  right  are you well  



 at all events i have no reason to reproach myself in this accursed

business  i gave you sufficient warning  



 has the king returned to the louvre  



  nonsense   you said   a workman  a nobody  a fine sight it will be  

you have seen it  my poor friend  



 i asked you if his majesty has returned from fontainebleau  



 yes  and he keenly regrets not having reached paris on sunday  in order

to look on from one of his towers at his goldsmith s victory over his

provost  



 what is said at court  



 why  they say that you were thoroughly whipped  



 hum   said the provost  who began to be annoyed by this desultory

conversation 



 how was it  did he really give you such an ignominious whipping  



 why   



 he killed two of your men  did he not  



 i think so  



 if you wish to replace them  i have two italian bravos  consummate

fighting men  who are quite at your service  you will have to pay them

well  but they are sure men  



 we shall see  i won t say no  if not for myself  i may require them for

my son in law  comte d orbec  



 whatever they may say  i cannot believe that this benvenuto cudgelled

you personally  



 who says so  



 everybody  some are indignant  like myself  others laugh  like the

king  



 enough  we have not seen the end of this affair  



 ah  you were very wrong to compromise yourself with such a clown  and

for such a paltry affair  



 i shall fight for my honor henceforth  



 if there had been a woman in the affair  why  you might properly have

drawn your sword against such people  but for a mere place to sleep

in   



 the hôtel de nesle is a place for princes to sleep in  



 agreed  but even so  think of exposing yourself for such a matter to be

chastised by a blackguard  



 ah  i have an idea  marmagne   said the provost   parbleu  you are so

devoted to me that i long to render you a friendly service  and i am

delighted to have the opportunity now  for a nobleman  and secretary to

the king  you are wretchedly located on rue de la huchette  my dear

viscount  now i recently requested for a friend of mine  from the

duchesse d etampes  who refuses nothing that i ask  apartments in such

one of the king s palaces as my friend might select  i obtained the

privilege for him  not without difficulty  but it so happens that he has

been called to spain on urgent business  i have therefore at my disposal

the document signed by the king containing this grant of apartments  i

cannot make use of it myself  will you have it  i should be happy to

acknowledge thus your services and your generous friendship  



 dear d estourville  how can i ever repay you  it is quite true that i

am living in very unsuitable quarters  and i have complained to the king

a score of times  



 i shall insist upon one condition  



 what is that  



 that  inasmuch as you are at liberty to take your choice among all the

royal hotels  you will choose   



 go on  i am waiting  



 the hôtel de nesle  



 aha  you were laying a trap for me  



 not at all  and to show you that i am speaking seriously  here is the

document  duly signed by his majesty  with the necessary blanks for the

name of the beneficiary  and of the place selected  i will write the

hôtel du grand nesle  and leave you to insert such names as you

choose  



 but this damned benvenuto  



 is entirely off his guard  relying upon a treaty we entered into and

signed  whoever cares to enter will find the doors open  and if on a

sunday he will find the rooms empty  in any event  it s not a matter of

turning benvenuto out  but simply of sharing the grand nesle with him 

for it is quite large enough for three or four families  benvenuto will

hear reason   well  what are you doing now  



 i am writing my names and titles in the grant  do you see  



 beware  benvenuto is more to be feared than you think  



 bah  i will take my two fire eaters and surprise him some sunday  



 what  compromise yourself with a clown for such a trifling matter  



 a victor is always right  and then  too  i shall be avenging a friend  



 good luck to you then  i have given you fair warning  marmagne  



 thanks twice over   once for the gift and once for the warning  



and marmagne  delighted beyond measure  thrust the precious paper in his

pocket  and set out in all haste to make sure of his two bravos 



 very good   said messire d estourville  rubbing his hands and looking

after him   go on  viscount  and one of two things will come of

it   either you will avenge me for benvenuto s victory  or benvenuto

will avenge me for your sarcasm  in any case  i shall be the gainer  i

make my enemies of each other  let them fight and kill  i will

applaud every blow on either side  for all will be equally gratifying to

me  



let us now cross the seine and look in upon the occupants of the

grand nesle  and see how they were employing their time  pending the

results of the provost s militant hatred 



benvenuto  in the tranquil confidence of conscious strength  had quietly

resumed the work he had in hand  without suspecting or caring for

messire d estourville s animosity  his day was divided thus  he rose at

daybreak  and went at once to a small  isolated room that he had

discovered in the garden  above the foundry  with a window from which

one could look obliquely into the flower garden of the petit nesle 

there he worked during the forenoon upon the model of a small statue of

hebe  after dinner  that is to say  at one o clock in the afternoon  he

went to the studio and worked at his jupiter  in the evening  for

relaxation  he played a game of tennis  or went for a walk 



now let us see how catherine employed her time  she sewed and sang and

ran hither and thither  instinct with joyous life  much more at her ease

in the grand nesle than at the cardinal of ferrara s palace 



ascanio  whose wound made it impossible for him to work  did not find

the time irksome  notwithstanding the activity of his mind  for he was

dreaming 



if now  availing ourselves of the thief s privilege of climbing walls 

we enter the petit nesle  this is what we shall see there  in the first

place  colombe  in her chamber  dreaming like ascanio  we beg leave to

pause here for the moment  all that we can say is  that  while ascanio s

dreams were rose colored  poor colombe s were black as night  and then

here is dame perrine just setting out to market  and we must  if you

please  follow her for an instant 



for a long time  so at least it seems to us  we have lost sight of the

good dame  indeed  it must be said that courage was not her

predominating virtue  and amid the perilous encounters we have described

she had purposely kept herself out of sight  but when peace began to

bloom once more  the roses reappeared in her cheeks  and as benvenuto

resumed his artistic labors she peaceably resumed her joyous humor  her

chattering  her gossip s inquisitiveness   in a word  the practice of

all the excellent housewifely qualities 



dame perrine on her way to market was obliged to pass across the common

courtyard  for the new door for the petit nesle was not yet made  now it

happened  by the merest chance  that ruperta  benvenuto s old

maid servant  was setting out at precisely the same moment to purchase

her master s dinner  these two estimable individuals were much too well

suited to each other to share the antipathies of their masters  so they

walked along together on the best possible terms  and  as talking

shortens the longest road by half  they talked 



ruperta began by inquiring of dame perrine the price of various

articles  and the names of the dealers in the quarter  from that they

passed to more interesting subjects 



 is your master such a terrible man   queried dame perrine 



 terrible  when you don t offend him he is as gentle as a jesus  but 

dame  when one doesn t do as he wishes  i must say that he s not very

agreeable  he is fond  oh  very fond  of having his own way  that s his

mania  and when he once gets a thing in his head  all the five hundred

thousand devils in hell can t drive if out  but you can lead him like a

child by pretending to obey him  and it s very pleasant to hear him

talk  you should hear him say to me   dame ruperta    he calls me

ruperta in his strange pronunciation  although my real name is ruperte 

at your service    dame ruperta  this is an excellent leg of mutton  and

done to a turn  dame ruperta  your beans are seasoned most triumphantly 

dame ruperta  i look upon you as the queen of governesses    and all

this so winningly that it touches one to the heart  



  à la bonne heure   but he kills people  they say  



 oh yes  when he s crossed  he kills very handily  it s a custom of his

country  but it s only when he s attacked  and then only in

self defence  otherwise he is very light hearted and prepossessing  



 i haven t seen him myself  he has red hair  hasn t he  



 no indeed  his hair is as black as yours and mine   as mine was  that

is  all  you have never seen him  well  just come in casually some time

to borrow something  and i ll show him to you  he s a handsome man  and

would make a superb archer  



 apropos of handsome men  how is our comely youth to day  the wounded

man  i mean  the attractive young apprentice who received such a

terrible wound in saving the provost s life  



 ascanio  pray do you know him  



 do i know him  he promised my young mistress colombe and myself to show

us his jewels  remind him of it  if you please  my dear madame  but all

this doesn t answer my question  and colombe will be very glad to know

that her father s savior is out of danger  



 oh  you can tell her that he is doing very well  he got up just now 

but the surgeon has forbidden his leaving his room  although i think a

breath of fresh air would do him a world of good  it s out of the

question  though  in this burning sun  your grand nesle garden is a

veritable desert  not a shaded spot anywhere  no vegetation but nettles

and briers  and four or five leafless trees  it s enormous  but very

unpleasant to walk in  our master consoles himself with tennis  but poor

ascanio isn t well enough yet to hold a racket  and must be bored to

death  he s so active  the dear boy   i speak of him in that way because

he s my favorite  and is always courteous to his ciders  he s not like

that bear of a pagolo  or catherine the giddy pate  



 and you say that the poor fellow   



 must be eating his heart out with having to pass whole days on a couch

in his bedroom  



 mon dieu   exclaimed kind hearted dame perrine   pray tell the poor boy

to come over to the petit nesle  where there is such beautiful shade  i

will gladly admit him  although messire le prévôt has expressly

forbidden it  why  it would be most virtuous in me to disobey him  in

order to benefit the man who saved his life  and you talk of ennui  we

are the ones who are drying up with it  the comely apprentice will

divert us  he will tell us tales of his italy  and show us his necklaces

and bracelets  and chatter with colombe  young folks like to be together

and prattle  and they languish in solitude  so it s agreed  isn t it 

just tell your benjamin that he s at liberty to come and walk in our

garden whenever he pleases  provided he comes alone  or with you  dame

ruperte  to give him your arm  knock four times  the first three gently

and the last louder  i shall know what it means  and i will come and

open the door  



 thanks for ascanio and myself  i will not fail to tell him of your

amiable offer  and he will not fail to avail himself of it  



 i am delighted to think so  dame ruperte  



  au revoir   dame perrine  charmed to have made the acquaintance of

such an estimable person  



 the same to you  dame ruperte  



the two gossips bowed low to each other  and parted with mutual

satisfaction 



the gardens of the séjour de nesle were in truth  as ruperta said  dry

and scorched on one side of the wall  cool and shady as a forest on the

other  the provost s miserly instinct led him to leave the garden of the

grand nesle uncared for  as the cost of keeping it in condition would

have been considerable  and he was not sufficiently sure of his title to

renew  perhaps for the benefit of his successor  the trees which he had

lost no time in cutting down as soon as he took possession  his

daughter s presence at the petit nesle accounted for his leaving the

shady thickets there untouched  as the poor child had no other

recreation than to sit beneath them  raimbault and his two assistants

sufficed to keep colombe s garden in order  and even to embellish it

somewhat 



it was laid out and planted in extremely good taste  at the back was the

kitchen garden  dame perrine s kingdom  along the wall dividing it from

the grand nesle colombe had her flower garden  called by dame perrine

the morning avenue  because the sun s early rays fell full upon it  and

sunrise was the time ordinarily selected by colombe to water her

marguerites and roses  let us note  in passing  that from the room over

the foundry in the grand nesle one could see every movement of the

lovely gardener without being seen  following out dame perrine s

geographical nomenclature  there was the noonday avenue  terminated by a

thicket where colombe loved to sit  and read or embroider  during the

beat of the day  at the other end of the garden was the evening avenue 

planted with a triple row of lindens  which made it delightfully cool

and fresh  it was here that colombe was accustomed to walk after supper 



this last named avenue dame perrine had in mind as a spot well adapted

to hasten the convalescence of the wounded ascanio  she was very

careful  however  to say nothing to colombe of her charitable

intentions  it was possible that she would be too obedient to her

father s commands  and would refuse to concur in her governess s open

defiance of them  and in that case what would dame ruperta think of her

neighbor s authority and influence  no  since she had gone so far 

perhaps a little recklessly  she must go on to the end  indeed  the good

woman s offence was excusable when we reflect that she had no one but

colombe to whom she could speak from morning till night  and more often

than not colombe was so deeply absorbed in her own thoughts that she did

not reply 



the reader will readily understand ascanio s ecstasy when he learned

that paradise was open to him  and how fervently he blessed ruperta  he

insisted upon availing himself of his good fortune on the instant  and

ruperta had all the difficulty in the world in persuading him that he

ought at least to wait until evening  he had every reason to believe

that dame perrine s suggestion was made with colombe s sanction  and

that thought made him mad with joy  with how great impatience 

therefore  mingled with vague alarm  did he count the dragging hours  at

last  at last  the clock struck five  the apprentices left the studio 

benvenuto had been away since noon  and was believed to have gone to the

louvre 



thereupon ruperta said solemnly to the apprentice  who gazed at her as

she had not been gazed at for many a year   



 now that the time has come  follow me  young man  



they crossed the courtyard together  and she knocked four times at the

door leading into the precincts of the petit nesle 



 say nothing of this to the master  good ruperta   said ascanio  who

knew that cellini was a good deal of a scoffer and sceptic in the matter

of love  and did not choose to have his pure flame profaned by his

witticisms 



ruperta was on the point of making inquiries as to the reason for this

injunction  which it would be hard for her to obey  when the door opened

and dame perrine appeared 



 come in  my fine fellow   she said   how are you to day  pallor becomes

you  do you know  it s a pleasure to look at you  come in also  dame

ruperta  take the path to the left  young man  colombe is just coming

down to the garden  it s the time when she always walks  do you try and

persuade her not to scold me too severely for admitting you  



 what   cried ascanio    mademoiselle colombe doesn t know   



 no indeed  do you think she would have consented to disobey her father 

i have brought her up on correct principles  i disobeyed for both 

myself  faith  i don t care  we can t always live like hermits 

raimbault won t see anything  or  if he does  i have a way to make him

hold his tongue  if worse comes to worst  it won t be the first time i

have held my own against monsieur le prévôt  



dame perrine was very loquacious concerning her master  but ruperta

alone followed her in what she said  ascanio was standing still 

listening to nothing save the beating of ids heart  he did  however 

hear these words  let fall by dame perrine as they moved away   



 this is the path where colombe walks every evening  and she will soon

be here without doubt  you see that the sun won t reach you here  my

gallant invalid  



ascanio expressed his thanks with a gesture  and walked forward a few

steps  once more immersed in his reverie  and anticipating what was to

come with mingled anxiety and impatience  he heard dame perrine say to

ruperta as they walked along   



 this is colombe s favorite bench  



and upon that he left the two gossips to continue their walk and their

conversation  and sat softly down without a word upon the sacred seat 



what was his purpose  whither was he going  he had no idea  he sought

colombe because she was young and fair  and he was young and fair  no

ambitious thought had ever entered his head in connection with her  to

be near her was his only desire  for the rest he put his trust in god 

or  rather  he did not look so far into the future  there is no

to morrow in love 



colombe  for her part  had thought more than once  and in spite of

herself  of the young stranger who had appeared to her in her loneliness

as gabriel appeared to mary  to see him once more had been from the

first the secret desire of this child  who had hitherto had no desire 

but  being abandoned by an inconsiderate father to the guardianship of

her own virtue  she was too high minded not to deal with herself with

the severity which noble souls never think themselves free to dispense

with unless their will is fettered  she therefore bravely put aside her

thoughts of ascanio  and yet those thoughts persisted in forcing a way

through the triple ramparts colombe had built around her heart  more

easily than ascanio made his way through the wall of the grand nesle  so

it was that colombe had passed the three or four days since the

engagement  alternating between the fear of not seeing ascanio again 

and alarm at the thought of being in his presence  her only consolation

was to dream of him as she sat at her work or walked in the garden 

during the day she shut herself up in her own room  to the despair of

dame perrine  who was thereby doomed to carry on a perpetual monologue

in the abyss of her own thoughts  as soon as the intense heat of the day

had gone by  she would go down to the cool  shady path  poetically

christened by dame perrine the evening avenue  and there  sitting on the

bench where ascanio now sat  she would allow the sun to set and the

stars to rise  listening and replying to her thoughts  until dame

perrine came to tell her that it was time to retire 



at the usual hour  then  the young man saw colombe suddenly appear  book

in hand  at the end of the path where he was sitting  she was reading

the  lives of the saints   a dangerous romance of faith and love  well

adapted  perhaps  to prepare one for the cruel sufferings of life  but

not  surely  for the cold realities of the world  colombe did not see

ascanio at first  but started back in surprise when she saw a strange

woman with dame perrine  at that decisive moment  dame perrine  like a

determined general  plunged boldly to the heart of the question 



 dear colombe   she said   i know your kind heart so well that i didn t

think i needed your express sanction to allow a poor wounded youth  who

received his wound in your father s cause  to come and take the air

under these trees  you know there is no shade at the grand nesle  and

the surgeon won t answer for his life unless he can walk an hour every

day  



while she was uttering this well intentioned but barefaced falsehood 

colombe suddenly spied ascanio  and a vivid flush suffused her cheeks 

the apprentice  meanwhile  in the presence of colombe  could hardly

summon strength to rise to his feet 



 it wasn t my sanction that was necessary  dame perrine   said the

maiden at last   but my father s  



as she said these words  sadly but firmly  colombe reached the stone

bench upon which ascanio had been sitting 



he overheard her  and said  with clasped hands   



 forgive me  madame  i thought  i hoped that your kindness had ratified

dame perrine s courteous offer  but if it is not so   he continued  in a

tone of great gentleness  not unmixed with pride   i beg you to excuse

my involuntary boldness  and i will withdraw at once  



 but it is not for me to decide   replied colombe hastily  deeply moved 

 i am not mistress here  remain to day at all events  even if my

father s prohibition was meant to extend to him who saved his life 

remain  monsieur  if for nothing else than to receive my thanks  



 o madame   murmured ascanio   it is for me to thank you  and i do so

from the bottom of my heart  but by remaining shall i not interfere with

your walk  the place i have taken  too  is ill chosen  



 not at all   rejoined colombe mechanically  without apparently paying

attention  so embarrassed was she  to the other end of the stone bench 



at that moment dame perrine  who had not stirred since colombe s

mortifying reprimand  growing weary of her own immobility and her young

mistress s silence  took dame ruperta s arm and walked softly away 



the young people were left alone 



colombe  whose eyes were fixed upon her book  did not at first observe

the departure of her governess  and yet she was not reading  for there

was a mist before her eyes  she was still excited and dizzy  all that

she was capable of doing  and that she did instinctively  was to conceal

her agitation  and repress the violent beating of her heart  ascanio 

too  was beside himself  he was excessively pained when he thought that

colombe desired to send him away  and insanely happy when he fancied

that he could detect signs of emotion in his inamorata  and these sudden

alternations of emotion in his enfeebled state transported and unnerved

him at the same time  he was like one in a swoon  and yet his thoughts

followed upon one another s heels with astounding rapidity and force 

 she despises me  she loves me   he said to himself almost in the same

breath  he glanced at colombe  silent and still  and the tears rolled

down his cheeks  although he felt them not  meanwhile a bird was singing

in the branches overhead  the leaves were scarcely stirring in the

gentle breeze  from the augustine church the evening angelus came

floating softly downward through the air  never was july evening more

calm and peaceful  it was one of nature s solemn moments  when the soul

enters a new sphere   one of those moments which seem twenty years  and

which one remembers all his life 



the two lovely children  so well suited to each other  had but to move

their hands to join them  and yet it seemed as if there were a yawning

gulf between them 



after a moment or two colombe raised her head   



 you are weeping   she cried  obeying an impulse stronger than her will 



 i am not weeping   said ascanio  falling back upon the bench  but his

hands were wet with tears when he took them from his face 



 it is true   he said   i am weeping  



 why  what is the matter  i will call some one  are you in pain  



 only from my thoughts  



 what thoughts  pray  



 i was thinking that perhaps it would have been better for me to die the

other day  



 die  how old are you  pray  that you should talk thus of dying  



 nineteen  but the age of unhappiness is a fit age for death  



 and what of your kindred  who would weep for you   said colombe 

unconsciously eager for a glimpse into the past of this life  of which

she had a confused feeling that the future would be involved with her

own 



 i have no father or mother  and there is no one to weep for me save my

master  benvenuto  



 poor orphan  



 yes  an orphan indeed  my father never loved me  and i lost my mother

at ten years  just when i was beginning to understand her love and

return it  my father  but what am i saying  and what are my father and

my mother to you  



 oh  yes  go on  ascanio  



 saints in heaven  you remember my name  



 go on  go on   whispered colombe  putting her hands before her face to

hide her blushes 



 my father was a goldsmith  and my dear mother was herself the daughter

of a florentine goldsmith  named raphael del moro  of a noble italian

family  for in our italian republics  to work implies no dishonor  and

you will see more than one ancient and illustrious name on the sign of a

shop  my master  cellini  for example  is as noble as the king of

france  if not even more so  raphael del moro  who was poor  compelled

his daughter stefana to marry  against her will  a fellow goldsmith

almost of his own age  but very wealthy  alas  my mother and benvenuto

cellini loved each other  but were both fortuneless  benvenuto was

travelling everywhere to make a name for himself and earn money  he was

far away  and could not interfere to prevent the marriage  gismondo

gaddi  that was my father s name  soon began to detest his wife because

she did not love him  although he never knew that she loved somebody

else  my father was a man of a violent and jealous disposition  may he

forgive me if i accuse him wrongfully  but children have a relentless

memory for their wrongs  very often my mother sought shelter by my

cradle from his brutal treatment  but he did not always respect that

sanctuary  sometimes he struck her  may god forgive him  while she held

me in her arms  and at every blow my mother would give me a kiss to help

deaden the pain  ah  i remember well both the blows my mother received

and the kisses she gave me 



 the lord  who is just  dealt a blow at my father where he would feel it

most keenly   in his wealth  which was dearer to him than anything else

in the world  disaster after disaster overwhelmed him  he died of grief

because his money was all gone  and my mother died a few days after 

because she thought that she was no longer beloved 



 i was left alone in the world  my father s creditors laid hands upon

all that he left  and  in all their ferreting to make sure that they had

forgotten nothing  they failed to discover a little weeping child  an

old maid servant who was fond of me kept me two days from charity  but

she was living on charity herself  and had none too much bread for her

own needs 



 she was uncertain what to do with me  when a man covered with dust

entered the room  took me in his arms  embraced me  weeping  and  having

given the good old woman some money  took me away with him  it was

benvenuto cellini  who had come from rome to florence expressly to find

me  he cherished me  instructed me in his art  and kept me always with

him  and  as i say he is the only one who would weep for my death  



colombe listened with lowered eyes and oppressed heart to the orphan s

story  which in the matter of loneliness was her own  and to the story

of the poor mother s life  which would perhaps be hers some day  for she

too was doomed to marry against her will a man who would hate her

because she would not love him 



 you are unjust to god   she said to ascanio   there is some one  your

kind master at least  who loves you  and you knew your mother  i cannot

remember my mother s kisses  for she died in giving birth to me  i was

brought up by my father s sister  a crabbed  ill tempered woman  and yet

i mourned her bitterly when i lost her two years ago  for in the absence

of any other affection my heart clung to her as ivy clings to a cliff 

for two years i have been living in this place with dame perrine  and

notwithstanding my loneliness  and although my father comes very rarely

to see me  these two years have been and will be the happiest of my

whole life  



 you have indeed suffered much   said ascanio   but though the past has

been so painful  why do you dread the future  yours  alas  is full of

glorious promise  you are nobly born  rich  and beautiful  and the

shadow of your early years will only bring out in bolder relief the

splendor of the rest of your life  



colombe sadly shook her head 



 oh mother  mother   she murmured 



when  rising in thought above the paltry present  one loses sight of the

trivial necessities of the moment in the brilliant flashes which

illuminate and epitomize a whole life  past and future  the heart is

sometimes affected with a dangerous vertigo  and when one s memory is

laden with a thousand sorrows  when one dreads bitter anguish to come 

the same heart is often a prey to terrible emotion and fatal weakness 

one must be very strong not to fall when the weight of destiny is

pressing down upon one s heart  these two children  who had already

suffered so much  who had been always alone  had but to pronounce a

single word to make a single future for their twofold past  but one was

too dutiful  the other too respectful  to pronounce that word 



ascanio gazed at colombe  however  with infinite tenderness in his eyes 

and colombe permitted his scrutiny with divine trust  with clasped

hands  and in the tone in which he might have prayed  the apprentice

said to the maiden   



 colombe  if you have any desire which i can gratify by pouring out all

my blood to gratify it  if any disaster threatens you  and nothing more

than a life is needed to avert it  say one word to me  colombe  as you

might say it to your brother  and i shall be very happy  



 thanks  thanks   said colombe   i know that you have already nobly

risked your life once at a word from me  but god alone can save me this

time  



she had no time to say more  for dame perrine and dame ruperta stopped

in front of them at that moment 



the gossips had made the most of their time  as well as the two lovers 

and had formed a close alliance  based upon mutual sympathy  dame

perrine had confided to dame ruperta an infallible cure for chilblains 

and dame ruperta  not to be outdone  had imparted to dame perrine the

secret of preserving plums  after such an exchange of confidence  it is

easy to understand that they were thenceforth united for life and death 

and they had agreed to meet frequently  whatever the cost 



 well  colombe   said dame perrine  as they drew nigh the bench   do you

still bear me a grudge  tell me  wouldn t it have been a shame to

refuse admission to him but for whom the house would have no master 

shouldn t we do our utmost to help cure this youth of a wound received

for us  look  dame ruperta  and see if he doesn t already look better 

and if he hasn t more color than when he came  



 yes indeed   assented ruperta   he never had more color when he was in

the best of health  



 consider  colombe   continued dame perrine   it would be downright

murder to interrupt convalescence so happily begun  come  the end

justifies the means  you will allow me to admit him to morrow at dusk 

won t you  it will be a pleasant change for you as well  poor child  and

a very innocent one  god knows  when dame ruperta and i are both here 

upon my word  colombe  you need some sort of a change  and who is there

to tell the provost that we have softened his stern orders a bit  and

remember that  before he gave the order  you told ascanio that he might

come and show you his jewels  he forgot them to day  so he must bring

them to morrow  



colombe looked at ascanio  the color had fled from his cheeks  and he

was awaiting her reply in an agony of suspense 



in the eyes of a poor girl  kept a prisoner and tyrannized over  there

was a world of flattery in this humility  there was then some one in the

world whose happiness depended upon her  whom she could make glad or sad

with a word  every one exults in his own power  the insolent airs of

comte d orbec had humiliated colombe very recently  the hapless

prisoner  forgive her  pray   could not resist the longing to see the

joyful light shine in ascanio s eyes  so she said  with a blush and a

smile   



 dame perrine  what is this you have persuaded me to do  



ascanio tried to speak  but could only clasp his hands effusively  his

knees trembled under him 



 thanks  fair lady   said ruperta  with a deep courtesy   come  ascanio 

you are still weak  and it is time to go in  give me your arm  and let

us go  



the apprentice could hardly muster strength to say  adieu  and  thanks  

but he supplemented his words with a look in which his heart spoke

volumes  and meekly followed the servant  his whole being overflowing

with joy 



colombe fell back upon the bench  absorbed in thought  and conscious of

a pleasurable excitement  for which she reproached herself  and which

was entirely unfamiliar to her 



 until to morrow   said dame perrine  triumphantly  as she took leave

of her guests after escorting them to the door   if you choose  young

man  you can come in this way every day for three months  



 and why for three months only   asked ascanio  who had dreamed of

coming always 



 dame   was dame perrine s reply   because in three months colombe is to

marry comte d orbec  



ascanio needed all the strength of his will to keep from falling 



 colombe to marry comte d orbec   he muttered   o mon dieu  mon dieu  so

i deceived myself  colombe does not love me  



as dame perrine closed the door behind him at that moment  and dame

ruperta was walking in front of him  neither of them overheard 









xii





the king s queen





we have said that benvenuto left the studio about noon without saying

whither he was going  he went to the louvre to return the visit

françois i  paid him at the cardinal of ferrara s hotel 



the king had kept his word  the name of benvenuto cellini was given to

all the doorkeepers and ushers  and all the doors flew open before

him   all the doors save one  that leading to the council chamber 

françois was discussing affairs of state with the first men in his

realm  and  although the king s orders were explicit  they dared not

introduce cellini in the midst of the momentous session then in progress

without further instructions from his majesty 



in truth  france was at this time in a critical situation  we have thus

far said but little of affairs of state  feeling sure that our readers 

especially those of the gentler sex  would prefer affairs of the heart

to politics  but we have at last reached a point where we can no longer

draw back  and where we must needs cast a glance  which we will make as

brief as possible  at france and spain  or rather at françois i  and

charles v   for in the sixteenth century kings were nations 



at the period at which we have arrived  by virtue of one of the

periodical movements of the political see saw  of which both so often

felt the effects  françois s situation had recently improved  and

charles s grown worse in equal degree  in fact  things had changed

materially since the treaty of cambrai  which was negotiated by two

women  margaret of austria  aunt of charles v   and the duchesse

d angoulême  mother of françois i  this treaty  which was the

complement of the treaty of madrid  provided that the king of spain

should cede burgundy to the king of france  and that the king of france

should renounce his claim to the homage of flanders and artois 

furthermore  the two young princes  who served as hostages for their

father  were to be sent back to him in exchange for the sum of two

millions of golden crowns  lastly  good queen eleanora  charles v  s

sister  who was promised at first to the constable  bourbon  as a reward

for his treachery  and was afterwards married to françois as a pledge

of peace  was to return to the court of france with the two children  to

whom she had been as affectionate and devoted as any mother  these

stipulations were carried out with equal good faith on both sides 



but it will readily be believed that françois s renunciation of his

claim to the duchy of milan  exacted from him during his captivity  was

only momentary  he was no sooner a free man once more  no sooner

restored to power and health  than he turned his eyes again toward

italy  it was with the object of procuring countenance of his claims at

the court of rome that he had married his son henri  become dauphin by

the death of his elder brother françois  to catherine de medicis  niece

of pope clement vii 



unfortunately  just at the moment when all the preparations for the

king s meditated invasion were completed  clement vii  died  and was

succeeded by alexander farnese  who ascended the throne of st  peter

under the name of paul iii 



now paul iii  was determined not to allow himself to be inveigled into

supporting the party of the emperor  or of the king of france  but to

adhere strictly to the policy of holding an equal balance between them 



with his mind at ease in that direction  the emperor laid aside all

anxiety on the subject of the preparations of france  and busied himself

fitting out an expedition against tunis  which had been seized by the

corsair cher eddin  so famous under the name of barbarossa  who  having

driven out muley hassan  had taken possession of the country  and was

laying sicily waste 



the expedition was entirely successful  and charles v   after destroying

three or four ships  sailed into the bay of naples in triumph 



there he received tidings which tended to encourage him still more 

charles iii   duke of savoy  although he was the maternal uncle of

françois i   had followed the counsel of his new wife  beatrice 

daughter of emmanuel of portugal  and had abandoned the party of the

king of france  so that when françois  by virtue of his former treaties

with charles iii   called upon him to receive his troops  the duke of

savoy answered by refusing to do so  and françois was reduced to the

unenviable necessity of forcing the passage of the alps  which he had

hoped to find open to him by favor of his ally and kinsman 



but charles x  was awakened from his feeling of security by a veritable

thunder clap  the king marched an army into savoy so promptly that the

duke found his province actually under occupation by the french troops

before he suspected that it was invaded  biron  who was in command of

the army  seized chambéry  appeared upon the alpine passes  and

threatened piedmont just as francesco sforza  terror stricken doubtless

by the news of biron s success  died suddenly  leaving the duchy of

milan without an heir  and thereby not only making its conquest an easy

matter for françois  but giving him a strong claim to it as well 



biron marched down into italy  and seized turin  there he halted 

pitched his camp on the banks of the sesia  and awaited developments 



charles v  meanwhile had left naples for rome  the victory he had won

over the long time enemies of christ procured him the honor of a

triumphal entry into the capital of christendom  this entry intoxicated

the emperor to such a point  that  contrary to his custom  he went

beyond all bounds  and in full consistory accused françois i  of

heresy  basing the accusation upon the protection he accorded the

protestants  and upon his alliance with the turks  having recapitulated

all their former causes of disagreement  wherein  according to his view 

françois was always the first at fault  he swore to wage a war of

extermination against his brother in law 



his disasters in the past had made françois as prudent as he formerly

was reckless  and so  as soon as he found himself threatened at one time

by the forces of spain and of the empire  he left d annebaut to guard

turin  and called biron back to france  with orders to devote himself

entirely to protecting the frontiers 



those who were familiar with the chivalrous and enterprising character

of françois were at a loss to understand this retrograde movement  and

supposed from his taking one backward step that he considered himself

whipped in advance  this belief still further exalted the pride of

charles v   he took command of his army in person  and resolved upon

invading france from the south 



the results of this attempted invasion are well known  marseilles  which

had held out against the connétable de bourbon and the marquis of

pescara  the two greatest soldiers of the time  had no difficulty in

holding out against charles v   a great politician  but of only moderate

capacity as a general  charles was not discouraged  but left marseilles

behind  and attempted to march upon avignon  but montmorency had

constructed an impregnable camp between the durance and the rhone 

against which charles expended his force to no purpose  so that  after

six weeks of fruitless endeavor  repulsed in front  harassed upon the

flanks  and in great danger of having his retreat cut off  he ordered a

retreat which strongly resembled a rout  and  having narrowly escaped

falling into his enemy s hands  succeeded with great difficulty in

reaching barcelona  where he arrived without men or money 



thereupon all those who were awaiting the issue of his expedition to

declare themselves declared against charles v  henry viii  cast off his

wife  catherine of aragon  in order to espouse his mistress  anne

boleyn  soliman attacked the kingdom of naples and hungary  the

protestant princes of germany entered into a secret league against the

emperor  lastly  the people of ghent  weary of the incessant burdens

imposed upon them to defray the expense of the war against france 

suddenly rose in revolt  and sent ambassadors to françois to invite him

to place himself at their head 



but amid this universal upheaval  which threatened to destroy the

emperor s fortunes  new negotiations were entered upon by the king of

france and himself  the two monarchs had an interview at aigues mortes 

and françois  bent upon peace  which he felt to be an absolute

necessity for france  was determined thenceforth to rely upon friendly

negotiations to effect his objects  and not upon an armed struggle 



he therefore caused charles to be informed of the proposition of the men

of ghent  offering him at the same time liberty to pass through france

on his way to flanders 



the council had been called together to discuss this subject  when

benvenuto knocked at the door  and françois  true to his promise  as

soon as he was advised of the great artist s presence  ordered that he

be admitted  benvenuto therefore heard the end of the discussion 



 yes  messieurs   françois was saying   yes  i agree with monsieur de

montmorency  and it is my dream to conclude a lasting alliance with the

emperor elect  to raise our two thrones above all the rest of

christendom  and to wipe out all these corporations  communes  and

popular assemblies which assume to set bounds to our royal power by

refusing us to day the arms  to morrow the money  of our subjects  my

dream is to force back into the bosom of the true religion all the

heresies which distress our holy mother church  my dream is  lastly  to

unite all our forces against the enemies of christ  to drive the turkish

sultan from constantinople  were it only to prove that he is not  as he

is alleged to be  my ally  and to establish at constantinople a second

empire rivalling the first in power  in splendor  and in extent  that is

my dream  messieurs  and i have given it that name so that i may not

allow myself to be unduly exalted by hope of success  nor unduly cast

down if the future shall demonstrate  as it may  its impracticability 

but if it should be fulfilled  constable  if it should be fulfilled  if

i were to have france and turkey  paris and constantinople  the occident

and the orient  confess  messieurs  that it would be grand   that it

would be sublime  



 i understand  then  sire   said the duc de guise   that it is

definitely decided that you decline the suzerainty proffered you by the

ghentese  and that you renounce the former domains of the house of

burgundy  



 it is so decided  the emperor shall see that i am an ally as loyal as i

am a loyal foe  but first of all  and in any event  i desire and shall

demand that the duchy of milan be restored to me  it belongs to me by

hereditary right and by imperial investiture  and i will have it  on my

honor as a gentleman  but  i trust  without breaking with my brother

charles  



 and you will offer to allow charles v  to pass through france on his

way to ghent to chastise the rebels   asked poyet 



 yes  monsieur le chancelier   was the king s reply   despatch m  de

fréjus to day to extend the invitation in my name  let us show him that

we are disposed to go any length to maintain peace  but if he prefers

war   



a majestic  awe inspiring gesture accompanied this phrase  interrupted

for an instant as françois caught sight of his artist standing modestly

near the door 



 but if he prefers war   he resumed   by my jupiter  of whom benvenuto

brings me news  i swear that it shall be war bloody  desperate  and

terrible  well  benvenuto  where is my jupiter  



 sire   replied cellini   i bring you the model of your jupiter  but do

you know of what i was dreaming as i looked at you and listened to you 

i was dreaming of a fountain for your fontainebleau   a fountain to be

surmounted by a colossal statue sixty feet high  holding a broken lance

in its right hand  and with the left resting on its sword hilt  this

statue  sire  should represent mars   that is to say  your majesty  for

your nature is all courage  and you use your courage judiciously  and

for the defence of your glory  stay  sire  that is not all  at the four

corners of the base of the statue there should be four seated

figures   poetry  painting  sculpture  and generosity  of that i was

dreaming as i looked at you and listened to you  sire  



 and you shall cause your dream to live in marble or bronze  benvenuto 

such is my wish   said the king in a commanding tone  but with a

cordial  kindly smile 



all the members of the council applauded  for all deemed the king worthy

of the statue  and the statue worthy of the king 



 meanwhile   said the king   let us see our jupiter  



benvenuto drew the model from beneath his cloak  and placed it upon the

table  around which the destiny of the world had so recently been

debated 



françois gazed at it for a moment with undisguised admiration 



 at last   he cried   at last i have found a man after my own heart  my

friend   he continued  laying his hand upon benvenuto s shoulder   i

know not which of the two experiences the greater happiness  the prince

who finds an artist who thoroughly sympathizes with and understands all

his ideas  such an artist as yourself in short  or the artist who meets

a prince capable of appreciating him  i think that my pleasure is the

greater  upon my word  



 oh no  sire  permit me   cried cellini   surely mine is much the

greater  



 no  mine  benvenuto  



 i dare not contradict your majesty  and yet   



 let us say that we experience an equal amount of pleasure  my friend  



 you have called me your friend  sire   said benvenuto   that is a word

which pays me a hundred times over for all that i have done or can ever

do for your majesty  



 very well  it is my purpose to prove to you  benvenuto  that it was no

empty  meaningless word that escaped me  and that i called you my friend

because you are my friend in fact  bring me my jupiter completed as soon

as possible  and whatever you may ask of me when you bring it  upon my

honor as a gentleman  you shall have if a king s hand can procure it for

you  do you hear  messieurs  if i forget my promise  remind me of it  



 sire   cried benvenuto   you are a great and a noble king  and i am

ashamed that i am able to do so little for you  who do so much for me  



having kissed the hand the king held out to him  cellini replaced the

statue of jupiter under his cloak  and left the council chamber with his

heart overflowing with pride and joy 



as he left the louvre  he met primaticcio about to go in 



 whither go you so joyously  my dear benvenuto   he said  as cellini

hastened along without seeing him 



 ah  francesco  is it you   cried cellini   yes  you are quite right  i

am joyous indeed  for i have just seen our great  our sublime  our

divine françois i    



 and did you see madame d etampes   queried primaticcio 



 who said things to me  francesco  that i dare not repeat  although they

say that modesty is not my strong point  



 but what did madame d etampes say to you  



 he called me his friend  francesco  do you understand  he talked to me

as familiarly as he talks to his marshals  finally  he said that when my

jupiter is finished i may ask whatever favor i choose  and it is

accorded in advance  



 but what did madame d etampes promise you  



 what a strange man you are  francesco  



 why so  



 you persist in talking about madame d etampes when i speak of the

king  



 because i know the court better than you do  benvenuto  because you are

my countryman and my friend  because you have brought me a breath of air

from our dear italy  and in my gratitude i desire to save you from a

great danger  mark what i say  benvenuto  the duchesse d etampes is your

enemy  your mortal enemy  i have told you this before  when i only

feared it  i repeat it to day  when i am perfectly sure of it  you have

offended her  and if you do not appease her  benvenuto  she will ruin

you  benvenuto  mark well what i say  madame d etampes is the king s

queen  



 mon dieu  what is all this   cried cellini  with a laugh   i have

offended madame d etampes  how so  in god s name  



 oh  i know you  benvenuto  and i supposed that you knew no more than i

or the woman herself as to the cause of her aversion to you  but what

can we do  women are so constituted  they hate as they love  without

knowing why  and the duchesse d etampes hates you  



 what would you have me do  



 what would i have you do  i would have the courtier rescue the

sculptor  



 i  the courtier of a courtesan  



 you are wrong  benvenuto   said primaticcio  smiling   madame d etampes

is very beautiful  as every artist must admit  



 i admit it   said benvenuto 



 very well  go and say so to herself  and not to me  i ask nothing more

than that to make you the best friends in the world  you have wounded

her by some artist s whim  and it is your place to make the first

advances toward her 



 if i wounded her   said cellini   i did it unintentionally  or rather

without malice  she said some hitter words to me which i did not

deserve  i put her back where she belonged  and she did deserve it  



 never mind  never mind  forget what she said  benvenuto  and make her

forget your reply  i tell you again she is imperious and vindictive  and

she has the king s heart in her hand   a king who loves art  it is true 

but who loves love more  she will make you repent your audacity 

benvenuto  she will make enemies for you  she it was who inspired the

provost with courage to resist you  and listen  i am just setting out

for italy  i am going to rome by her command  and my journey  benvenuto 

is aimed at you   i  your friend  am compelled to become the instrument

of her spleen  



 what are you to do at rome  



 what am i to do there  you have promised the king to emulate the

ancients  and i know that you are a man to keep your promise  but the

duchess thinks you a braggart  and with a view of crushing you by the

comparison no doubt  she is sending me  a painter  to rome to make casts

of the most beautiful of the ancient statues  the laocoön  the venus 

the knife grinder  and god knows what  



 that is  indeed  refinement of hatred   said benvenuto  who 

notwithstanding his good opinion of himself  was not altogether

confident of the result of a comparison of his work with that of the

great masters   but to yield to a woman   he added  clenching his fists 

 never  never  



 who spoke of yielding  i will show you an excellent way to accomplish

it  she is pleased with ascanio  she wishes to employ him  and has

instructed me to bid him call upon her  now  nothing could be simpler

than for you to accompany your pupil to the hôtel d etampes and

introduce him yourself to the fair duchess  seize the opportunity  take

with you one of those marvellous jewels which you alone can make 

benvenuto  show it to her first  and when you see her eyes glisten as

she looks at it  offer it to her as an unworthy tribute to her beauty 

she will accept  will thank you gracefully  and will in return make you

some present worthy of you and take you back into favor  if  on the

other hand  you have that woman for an enemy  abandon henceforth all the

great things of which you are dreaming  alas  i too have been compelled

to stoop for a moment  only to rise to my full stature immediately 

until then that dauber rosso was preferred to me  he was put forward

everywhere  and always over my head  they made him intendant of the

crown  



 you are unjust to him  francesco   said cellini  unable to conceal his

real thought   he is a great painter  



 do you think so  



 i am sure of it  



 and so am i sure of it   said primaticcio   and that is just why i hate

him  they were using him to crush me  i flattered their wretched vanity 

and now i am the great primaticcio  and they are using me to crush you 

do as i did  therefore  benvenuto  you will never repent having followed

my advice  i implore you for your own sake and mine  i implore you in

the name of your renown and your future  both of which you will

compromise if you persist in your obstinacy  



 it is hard   said cellini  who was  however  perceptibly weakening in

his determination 



 if not for yourself  benvenuto  for the sake of our great king  do you

wish to tear his heart by compelling him to choose between a mistress he

adores  and an artist he admires  



 very well  so be it  for the king s sake i will do it   cried cellini 

overjoyed to find a pretext which would spare his self esteem 



  à la bonne heure    said primaticcio   you understand  of course 

that if a single word of this conversation should be repeated to the

duchess  it would cause my ruin  



 oh  i trust that you have no fears on that score  



 if benvenuto gives his word  all is said  



 you have it  



 in that case  adieu  brother  



 a pleasant journey to you  



 and good luck to you  



the two friends  having exchanged a cordial grasp of the hand  parted 

each with a gesture which summarized their whole conversation 









xiii





souvent femme varie





the hôtel d etampes was not far from the hôtel de nesle  our readers

will not be surprised therefore at our rapid flight from one to the

other 



it was located near the quai des augustins  and extended the whole

length of rue gilles le gueux  which was at a later date sentimentally

christened rue gît le cœur  the principal entrance was upon rue de

l hirondelle  françois i  had presented it to his mistress to induce

her to become the wife of jacques desbrosses  comte de penthièvre  as

he had given the dukedom of etampes and the government of bretagne to

jacques desbrosses  comte de penthièvre  to induce him to marry his

mistress 



the king had spared no pains to render his gift worthy of the lovely

anne d heilly  he had caused the old edifice to be refurbished and made

over according to the latest style 



upon its frowning façade the delicate flowers of the renaissance sprang

into life by magic  like so many thoughts of love  it was evident from

the zeal displayed by the king in the decoration of this princely abode 

that he anticipated passing almost as much of his time there as the

duchess herself  the apartments were furnished with royal magnificence 

and the whole establishment was upon the footing of that of a real

queen  much more extensive and luxurious  indeed  than that of the

chaste and kindly eleanora  sister of charles v  and the lawful wife of

françois i   who was a personage of so little importance in the world 

as well as at the french court 



if we are so indiscreet as to make our way into the duchess s sleeping

apartment early in the morning  we shall find her half reclining upon a

couch  her charming head supported by one of her lovely hands  and

passing the other carelessly through her chestnut locks  which shone

with a golden light  her bare feet seem even smaller and whiter than

they really are in her wide black velvet slippers  and her floating 

 négligée  morning gown lends an irresistible charm to the coquette s

fascinations 



the king is in the room  standing by a window  but he is not looking at

his duchess  he is tapping his fingers rhythmically against the glass 

and seems to be deep in meditation  he is thinking  no doubt  of the

momentous question of charles v  s journey through france 



 pray what are you doing there  sire  with your back turned   the

duchess finally asks  petulantly 



 making verses for you  my love  and they are finished at last  i

believe  



 oh  repeat them to me quickly  i pray you  my gallant crowned poet  



 that i will   the king replies  with the confidence of a laurel crowned

rhymer   listen   





 étant seul et auprès d une fenêtre 

par un matin comme le jour peignait 

je regardais aurore à main senestre 

qui à phœbus le chemin enseignait 

et d autre part ma mie qui peignait

son chef doré  et vis ses luisans yeux 

dont un jeta un trait si gracieux 

qu à haute voix je fus contraint de dire 

dieux immortels  rentrez dedans vos cieux 

car la beauté de ceste vous empire    5 





 oh  the lovely verses   says the duchess  clapping her hands   look at

aurora to your heart s content  henceforth i ll not be jealous of her 

since to her i owe such charming verses  say them to me once again  i

beg  



françois obligingly repeated his flattering lines  for his own benefit

as well as hers  but this time anne said nothing 



 what is the matter  my fair siren   said françois  who expected a

second compliment 



 the matter is  sire  that i am considering whether i will say to you

again even more emphatically what i said last evening  a poet has even

less pretext than a knightly king for allowing his mistress to be

insulted  for she is at the same time his mistress and his muse  



 again  naughty one   rejoined the king with an impatient gesture   an

insult indeed  bon dieu  your wrath is implacable  in good sooth  my

nymph of nymphs  when it leads you to neglect my verses  



 monseigneur  i hate as warmly as i love  



 and yet suppose i were to beg you to lay aside your animosity to

benvenuto   a great fool  who knows not what he says  who talks just as

he fights  heedless of consequences  and who had not  i swear  the

slightest purpose to wound you  you know  moreover  that clemency s the

attribute of goddesses  dear goddess mine  so pray forgive the simpleton

for love of me  



 simpleton  indeed   muttered anne 



 oh  a sublime simpleton  i grant you   said françois   i saw him

yesterday  and he promised to do marvellous things  he is a man  i

verily believe  who has no rival in his art  and will hereafter shed as

much lustre on my reign as andrea del sarto  titian  and leonardo da

vinci  you know how i love my artists  dearest duchess  so be

complaisant and indulgent to him  i beg you  mon dieu  an april shower 

a woman s caprice  and an artist s whim have more of fascination than of

ennui for me  come  come  do you  whom i do love so dearly  pardon at my

bidding  



 i am your servant  sire  and i will obey you  



 thanks  in return for this favor accorded by the woman s kindly heart 

you may demand such gift as pleases you that lies within the prince s

power to bestow  but  alas   t is growing late  and i must leave you 

the council meets again to day   t is an insufferable bore  ah  my good

brother charles makes the king s trade most irksome to me  with him

cunning replaces chivalry  the pen the sword  and  t is a burning shame 

upon my soul  i think we need new words to be devised for all this

science and erudition of government  adieu  my poor beloved  i will do

my best to be adroit and clever  you are very fortunate  my dear  for

you have only to remain beautiful  and heaven has made that an easy task

for you  adieu  nay  do not rise  my page is waiting for me in the

antechamber   au revoir   and think of me  



 as always  sire  



françois waved a last farewell to her with his hand  raised the

hangings  and went out  leaving the fair duchess alone  and she  true to

her promise  began at once  if we must say it  to think of other things 



madame d etampes was of an impulsive  active  ambitious nature  having

eagerly sought and gallantly won the king s love  it was not long before

that love ceased to satisfy her restless spirit  and she began to suffer

from ennui  neither admiral biron  nor the comte de longueval  whom she

loved for some time  nor diane de poitiers  whom she always hated 

furnished a sufficient amount of excitement for her needs  but within a

week the void in her heart had been measurably filled  and she had begun

to live again  thanks to a new hate and a new love  she hated cellini

and loved ascanio  and she was thinking of one or the other while her

women were completing her toilet 



when she was fully dressed except as to her headgear  the provost of

paris and the vicomte de marmagne were announced 



they were among the most devoted partisans of the duchess in the warfare

which existed at court between the dauphin s mistress  diane de

poitiers  and herself  one is naturally glad to see one s friends when

thinking of one s enemies  and the manner of madame d etampes was

infinitely gracious as she gave the scowling provost and the smiling

viscount her hand to kiss 



 messire le prévôt   she began  in a tone in which unfeigned wrath was

blended with compassion that contained no suggestion of offence   we

have been informed of the infamous treatment you have received from this

italian clown   you  our best friend   and we are extremely indignant  



 madame   replied d estourville  neatly turning his misfortune into an

occasion for flattery   i should have been ashamed if one of my years

and character had been spared by the villain who was not deterred by

your beauty and charm  



 oh   said anne   i think only of you  as to the insult to me

personally  the king  who is really too indulgent to these insolent

foreigners  has begged me to forget it  and i have done so  



 in that case  madame  the request we have to make will doubtless be but

ill received  and we ask your permission to withdraw without stating

it  



 what  messire d estourville  am i not at your service at all times  and

whatever may happen  speak  speak  or i shall lose my temper with so

distrustful a friend  



 very well  madame  this is what we have to say  i had believed that i

might dispose of this grant of lodgings which i owe to your munificence

in favor of the vicomte de marmagne  and naturally we cast our eyes upon

the hôtel de nesle  which has fallen into such bad hands  



 aha   said the duchess   you interest me immensely  



 the viscount  madame  accepted my suggestion in the first place with

the utmost enthusiasm  but now  upon reflection  he hesitates  and

thinks with terror of the redoubtable benvenuto  



 pardon me  my good friend   the viscount interposed    pardon me  you

explain the matter very ill  i am not afraid of benvenuto  but of the

anger of the king  i have no fear of being killed by the italian clown 

to use madame s words   no  no  what i fear  so to speak  is that i may

kill him  and that some ill may come to me for having deprived our lord

and master of a servitor by whom he seems to set great store  



 i ventured to hope  madame  that  in case of need  your protection

would not fail him  



 it has never yet failed my friends   said the duchess   and 

furthermore  have you not on your side a better friend than i   justice 

are you not acting in accordance with the king s will  



 his majesty   marmagne replied   did not himself designate the hôtel

de nesle as the abode of any other than benvenuto  and our choice  under

those circumstances  would seem very much like revenge   there s no

denying it  and then  suppose that i kill this cellini  as i can promise

to do  for i shall have two sure men with me  



 oh  mon dieu   exclaimed the duchess  showing her white teeth as she

smiled   the king s protection extends to living men  but i fancy that

he takes but little thought to avenge the dead  and when his admiration

for art is deprived of this particular subject  he will remember naught

save his affection for me  i trust  the man insulted me publicly and

outrageously  marmagne  do you forget it  



 but  madame   rejoined the prudent viscount   be very sure that you

know all you will have to defend  



 oh  you are perfectly clear  viscount  



 nay  madame  if you will permit me  i do not wish to leave you in

ignorance upon any point  it may be that force will fail to effect our

purpose with this devil of a man  in that event  we shall have recourse

to stratagem  if he escapes my bravos in his hôtel in broad daylight 

they will meet him again some night by accident in a lonely street 

and  they have daggers  madame  as well as swords  



 i understand   said the duchess  nor did she turn a shade paler while

listening to this little scheme of assassination 



 well  madame  



 well  viscount  i see that you are a man of precautions  and that it s

not well to be numbered among your enemies  deuce take me  



 but touching the affair itself  madame  



  t is serious  in very truth  and is perhaps worth reflecting upon  but

what was i saying  every one knows  the king himself included  that this

man has wounded me grievously in my pride  i hate him as bitterly as i

hate my husband or madame diane  and i  faith i think that i can promise

you  what is it  isabeau  why do you interrupt us  



the duchess s last words were addressed to one of her women  who entered

hurriedly in a state of intense excitement 



 mon dieu  madame   said she   i ask madame s pardon  but the florentine

artist  benvenuto cellini  is below with the loveliest little golden

vase you can imagine  he said very courteously that he has come to

present it to your ladyship  and he requests the favor of speaking with

you a moment  



 aha   exclaimed the duchess  with an expression of gratified pride 

 what reply did you make to him  isabeau  



 that madame was not dressed  and that i would go and inform her of his

presence  



 very good  it would seem   the duchess added  turning to the dismayed

provost   that our enemy sees the error of his ways  and begins to

realize who we are  and what we can do  all the same  he will not come

off so cheaply as he thinks  and i don t propose to accept his excuses

all in a moment  he must be made to feel the enormity of his offence and

the weight of our indignation a little more sensibly  say to him 

isabeau  that you have informed me  and that i bid him wait  



isabeau went out 



 i was saying  vicomte de marmagne   resumed the duchess  with a

perceptible softening in her tone   that what you were speaking of is a

very serious matter  and that i could hardly promise to give my

countenance to what is  after all  nothing less than ambuscade and

murder  



 but the insult was so pronounced   the provost ventured  to say 



 the reparation will be no less so  i trust  messire  this famous pride 

which has resisted the will of sovereigns  is yonder in my antechamber

awaiting the good pleasure of a woman  and two hours of this purgatory

will  in all conscience  sufficiently atone for an impertinent word  we

must not be altogether pitiless  provost  forgive him  as i shall

forgive him two hours hence  ought my influence over you to be less than

the king s over me  



 kindly permit us to take leave now  madame   said the provost  bowing 

 for i prefer not to make a promise to my real sovereign which i could

not keep  



 take your leave  oh no   said the duchess  who was determined to have

witnesses of her triumph   i intend  messire le prévôt  that you shall

be present at the humiliation of your enemy  and thus we shall both be

avenged by the same stroke  i devote the next two hours to you and the

viscount  nay  do not thank me  they say that you are marrying your

daughter to comte d orbec  i believe   a beautiful  parti   in sooth 

fine  i should have said  not beautiful  6  pray  sit you down  messire 

do you know that my consent is needful for this marriage  and you ve not

asked it yet  but i will give it you  d orbec is as devoted to me as

yourself  i hope that we are at last to see your lovely child  and have

her for our own  and that her husband will not be so ill advised as not

to bring her to court  what is her name  messire  



 colombe  madame  



 a sweet  pretty name   t is said that one s name has an influence upon

one s destiny  if it be so  the poor child should have a tender heart 

and be foredoomed to suffer  well  isabeau  what is it now  



 nothing  madame  he said that he would wait  



 ah  yes   t is well  i had forgotten him already  yes  yes  messire  i

say again  keep your eye on colombe  the count s a husband of the same

sort as mine  as ambitious as the duc d etampes is avaricious  and quite

capable of exchanging his wife for some duchy  and then you must be

beware of me as well  especially if she s as pretty as she s said to be 

you will present her to me  will you not  messire   t will be no more

than fair  so that i may be prepared to defend myself  



the duchess  exultant in anticipation of her triumph  ran on thus for a

long while with apparent unconcern  although her impatient joy could be

discerned in her every movement 



 well  well   she said at last   another half hour and the two hours

will have passed  then we will release poor benvenuto from his agony 

put yourselves in his place  he must suffer terribly  for he is little

wonted to this sort of sentry go  to him the louvre is always open  and

the king always visible  in truth  i pity him  although he well deserves

it  he must be gnashing his teeth  must be not  and then to be unable to

give vent to his anger  ha  ha  ha  i shall have many a hearty laugh

over this  but what is that i hear  bon dieu  all that shouting and

uproar  



 may it not be that the soul of the damned is wearying of purgatory  

suggested the provost  with renewed hope 



 i propose to go and see   said the duchess  turning pale   come with

me  my masters  come  



benvenuto  persuaded by the arguments we have heard to make his peace

with the all powerful favorite  on the day following his conversation

with primaticcio took the little golden vase as a peace offering  and

repaired to the hôtel d etampes  with ascanio leaning on his arm  still

very weak and very pale after a night of suffering  in the first place 

the footmen refused to announce him at so early an hour  and he lost a

good half hour parleying with them  he had already begun to lose his

temper  when isabeau at last made her appearance  and consented to

announce him to her mistress  she returned to say to benvenuto that the

duchess was dressing  and he must wait a short time  he took patience 

therefore  and sat himself down upon a stool beside ascanio  who was

considerably overdone  by the walk  in conjunction with his fever and

his painful thoughts 



an hour passed  benvenuto began to count the minutes   after all   he

thought   the toilette of a duchess is the most important function of

the day  and i don t propose to lose the benefit of the step i have

taken for a quarter of an hour more or less  



nevertheless  in the face of this philosophical reflection  he began to

count the seconds 



meanwhile ascanio turned paler and paler  he was determined to say

nothing to his master of his sufferings  and had accompanied him without

a word  but he had eaten nothing that morning  and  although he refused

to acknowledge it  he felt that his strength was failing him 



benvenuto could not remain seated  but began to stalk up and down the

room 



a quarter of an hour passed 



 are you suffering  my child   he asked 



 no  master  indeed i m not  you are the one who is suffering  be

patient  i beg you  for she cannot be long now  



at that moment isabeau appeared again 



 your mistress is very slow   said benvenuto 



the mischievous girl went to the window  and looked at the clock in the

courtyard 



 why  you have waited only an hour and a half   she said   why do you

complain  pray  



as cellini frowned  she laughed in his face  and tripped away 



benvenuto  by a violent effort  subdued his wrath once more  but in

order to do it he was obliged to resume his seat  and sat with folded

arms  silent and stem  he seemed calm  but his wrath was fermenting

silently  two servants stood like statues at the door  observing him

with a serious expression  which seemed to him derisory 



the clock struck the quarter  benvenuto glanced at ascanio  and saw that

he was paler than ever  and almost ready to faint 



 ah ça   he cried  throwing his self restraint to the winds   so this

is done designedly  i chose to believe what i was told  and wait

good naturedly  but if an insult is intended  and i am so little wonted

to them  that the thought did not occur to me  if an insult is intended 

i am not the man to allow myself to be insulted  even by a woman  and i

go  come  ascanio  



as he spoke  benvenuto  raising in his powerful hand the unhospitable

stool  on which the duchess in her wrath had humiliated him for two

mortal hours without his knowledge  let it fall to the floor and

shattered it  the valets made a movement toward him  but he half drew

his dagger and they stopped  ascanio  terrified for his master  essayed

to rise  but his excitement had exhausted what remained of his strength 

and he fell to the floor unconscious  benvenuto at first did not see

him 



at that moment the duchess appeared in the doorway  pale and trembling

with wrath 



 yes  i go   benvenuto repeated in a voice of thunder  perfectly well

aware of her presence  but addressing the valets   do you tell the woman

that i take my present with me to give to somebody  i know not whom  who ll

be more worthy of it than herself  tell her that  if she took me for

one of her valets  like yourselves  she made a sad mistake  and that we

artists do not sell our loyalty and homage as she sells her love  and

now make way for me  follow me  ascanio  



as he spoke  he turned toward his beloved pupil  and saw that his eyes

were closed  and that his head had fallen back against the wall 



 ascanio   he cried   ascanio  my child  fainting  perhaps dying  o

ascanio  my beloved  and  t is this woman again    and benvenuto turned

with a threatening gesture to madame d etampes  at the same time

starting to carry ascanio away in his arms 



the duchess meanwhile  transfixed with rage and terror  had not moved or

spoken  but when she saw ascanio with his head thrown back  and his long

hair dishevelled  as white as marble  and so beautiful in his pallor 

she rushed to him in obedience to an irresistible impulse  and fell on

her knees opposite benvenuto  seizing one of ascanio s hands in her own 



 why  the child is dying  if you take him away  monsieur  you will kill

him  he may need immediate attention  jerome  run and fetch master

andré  i do not mean that he shall go from here in this condition  do

you understand  you may go or stay  as you please  but leave him  



benvenuto cast a penetrating glance at the duchess  and one of deep

anxiety at ascanio  he realized that there could be no danger in leaving

his cherished pupil in the care of madame d etampes  while there might

be very serious danger in removing him without proper precaution  his

mind was soon made up  as always  for swift and inexorable decision was

one of cellini s most striking good or had qualities 



 you will answer for him  madame   he said 



 oh  with my life   cried the duchess 



he softly kissed his apprentice on the forehead  and  wrapping his cloak

about him  stalked proudly from the room  with his hand upon his dagger 

not without exchanging a glance of hatred and disdain with the duchess 

as for the two men  he did not deign to look at them 



anne followed her enemy so long as she could see him with eyes blazing

with wrath  then  with an entire change of expression  her eyes rested

sadly and anxiously upon the comely invalid  love took the place of

anger  the tigress became a gazelle once more 



 master andré   she said to her physician  who entered hurriedly   save

him  he is wounded and dying  



 it is nothing   said master andré   a mere passing weakness  



he poured upon ascanio s lips a few drops of a cordial which he always

carried about him 



 he is coming to himself   cried the duchess   he moved  now  master  he

must be kept quiet  must he not  take him into yonder room   she said to

the valets   and lay him upon a couch   but  hark ye   she added 

lowering her voice  so that none but they could hear   if one word

escapes you as to what you have seen and heard  your neck shall pay for

your tongue  go  



the trembling lackeys bowed  and  gently lifting ascanio  bore him away 



remaining alone with the provost and the vicomte de marmagne  prudent

and passive spectators of the outrage upon her  madame d etampes eyed

them both  especially the latter  with a scornful glance  but she

speedily repressed the inclination to express her contempt in words 



 i was saying  viscount   she began in a bitter tone  but calmly   i was

saying that the thing you proposed was very serious  but i did not

reflect sufficiently upon it  i have sufficient power  i think  to

permit me to strike down a traitor  even as i should have sufficient  if

need were  to deal with indiscreet friends  the king would condescend to

punish him this time  i trust  but i choose to avenge myself  punishment

would make the insult public  vengeance will bury it  you have been cool

and clever enough  messieurs  to postpone my vengeance  in order not to

compromise its success  and i congratulate you upon it  be shrewd enough

now  i conjure you  not to let it escape you  and do not compel me to

have recourse to others than yourselves  vicomte de marmagne  it is

necessary to speak plainly to you  i guarantee you equal impunity with

the executioner  but if you care for my advice  i advise you and your

sbirri to lay aside the sword  and trust to the dagger  say nothing  but

act  and that promptly  that is the most satisfactory response  adieu 

messieurs  



with these words  uttered in a short  abrupt tone  the duchess extended

her hand as if to point out the door to the two noblemen  they bowed

awkwardly  too confused to find words in which to frame an excuse  and

left the room 



 oh  to think that i am only a woman  and am obliged to resort to such

dastards   exclaimed anne  looking after them while her lips curled

disdainfully   oh how i despise them all  royal lover  venal husband 

valet in silken doublet  valet in livery   all save a single one whom in

my own despite i admire  and another whom i delight to love  



she entered the room to which the interesting invalid had been carried 

as she approached the couch ascanio opened his eyes 



 it was nothing   said master andré to the duchess   the young man has

received a wound in the shoulder  and fatigue  some mental shock  or

hunger  it may be  caused a momentary faintness  from which he has

completely recovered  as you see  by the use of cordials  he is fully

restored now  and may safely be taken home in a litter  



 very good   said the duchess  handing a purse to master andré  who

bowed low and went out 



 where am i   said ascanio  seeking to collect his thoughts 



 you are with me  at my home  ascanio   the duchess replied 



 at your home  madame  ah  yes  i recognize you  you are madame

d etampes  and i remember too  where is benvenuto  where is my master  



 do not stir  ascanio  your master is safe  never fear  he is dining

peaceably at home at the present moment  



 but how does it happen that he left me here  



 you lost consciousness  and he trusted you to my care  



 and you assure me  madame  that he is in no danger  that he went from

here unharmed  



 i tell you again  i promise you  ascanio  that he has never been less

exposed to danger than at this moment  ungrateful boy  when i  duchesse

d etampes  am watching over him and caring for him with the tender

solicitude of a sister  to persist in speaking of his master  



 o madame  i pray you pardon me  and accept my thanks   said ascanio 



 indeed  it s high time   rejoined the duchess  shaking her pretty head

with a sly smile 



thereupon she began to speak  giving to every word a tender intonation 

and to the simplest phrases the subtlest of meanings  asking every

question greedily and at the same time with respect  and listening to

every reply as if her destiny depended upon it  she was humble  soft and

caressing as a cat  quick to grasp every cue  like a consummate actress 

leading ascanio gently back to the subject if he wandered from it  and

giving him all the credit for ideas which she evolved and cunningly led

up to  seeming to distrust herself  and listening to him as if he were

an oracle  exerting to the utmost the cultivated  charming intellect

which  as we have said  caused her to be called the loveliest of

blue stockings and the most learned of beauties  in short  this

interview became in her hands the most cajoling flattery  and the

cleverest of seductions  as the youth for the third or fourth time made

ready to take his leave  she said  still detaining him   



 you speak  ascanio  with so much eloquence and fire of your goldsmith s

art  that it is a perfect revelation to me  and henceforth i shall see

the conception of a master where i have hitherto seen only an ornament 

in your opinion benvenuto is the great master of the art  



 madame  he has surpassed the divine michel angelo himself  



 i am pleased to hear it  you lessen the ill will i bear him on account

of his rude behavior to me 



 oh  you must not mind his roughness  madame  his brusque manner

conceals a most ardent and devoted heart  but benvenuto is at the same

time the most impatient and fiery of men  he thought that you were

making him wait in mere sport  and the insult   



 say the mischief   rejoined the duchess with the simulated confusion of

a spoiled child   it is the truth that i was not dressed when your

master arrived  and i simply prolonged my toilet a little  it was wrong 

very wrong  you see that i confess my sins to you freely  i knew not

that you were with him   she added eagerly 



 true  madame  but cellini  who is not very sagacious  i admit  and

whose confidence has been sadly abused  deems you to be  i may say it to

you who are so gracious and kind  very wicked and very terrible  and he

thought that he detected an insult in what was nothing more than child s

play  



 do you think so   queried the duchess  unable wholly to repress a

mocking smile 



 oh  forgive him  madame  he is noble hearted and generous  and if he

knew you as you are  believe me  he would ask your pardon for his error

on his knees  



 say no more  i pray you  do you think to make me love him now  i bear

him a grudge  i tell you  and  to begin with  i propose to raise up a

rival  



 that will be difficult  madame  



 no  ascanio  for you  his pupil  shall be the rival  allow me  at

least  if i must do homage to this great genius who detests me  to do it

indirectly  say  will you  of whose charming inventive talent cellini

himself boasts  refuse to place your talent at my service  and since you

do not share your master s prejudices against my person  will you not

prove it to me by consenting to assist in embellishing it  



 madame  all that i am and all the power i have is at your service  you

are so kind to me  you have inquired with so much interest concerning my

past and my hopes for the future  that i am henceforth devoted to you

heart and soul  



 child  i have done nothing yet  and i ask nothing from you at present

except a little of your talent  tell me  have you not seen some jewel of

surpassing beauty in your dreams  i have superb pearls  into what

marvellous creation would you like to transform them  my pretty wizard 

shall i confide to you an idea of my own  a moment since  as you lay in

yonder room with pale cheeks and head thrown back  i fancied that i saw

a beautiful lily whose stalk was bending in the wind  make me a lily of

pearls and silver to wear in my corsage   said the enchantress  placing

her hand upon her heart 



 ah  madame  such kindness   



 ascanio  do you care to repay my kindness  as you call it  promise me

that you will take me for your confidante  your friend  that you will

hide nothing from me of your acts  your plans  your sorrows  for i see

that you are unhappy  promise to come to me when you stand in need of

help or counsel  



 why  madame  you bestow one favor more upon me  rather than ask a proof

of my gratitude  



 however that may be  you promise  



 alas  i would have given you the promise yesterday  madame  for

yesterday i might have thought that i might some day need your help or

counsel  but to day it is in no one s power to help me  



 who knows  



 i know  madame  



 ah me  ascanio  you are unhappy  you are unhappy  you cannot deceive

me  



ascanio sadly shook his head 



 you are disingenuous with a friend  ascanio   t is not well done of

you   the duchess continued  taking the young man s hand  and softly

pressing it 



 my master must be anxious  madame  and i am afraid that my presence

discommodes you  i feel quite well again  allow me to withdraw  



 how eager you are to leave me  wait at least until a litter is prepared

for you  do not resist  it is the doctor s order  and my own  



anne called a servant  and gave him the necessary orders  then bade

isabeau bring her pearls and some of her jewels  which she handed to

ascanio 



 how i restore your freedom   she said   but when you are fully restored

to health  my lily will be the first thing you give your mind to  will

it not  meanwhile  think upon it  i beg you  and as soon as you have

finished your design come and show it to me  



 yes  madame la duchesse  



 and do you not wish me to think upon how i can be of service to you 

and to do whatever you wish  since you are doing for me what i wish 

come  ascanio  come  my child  and tell me what you sigh for  for at

your age one seeks in vain to still the heating of his heart  turn his

eyes away  and close his lips   one always sighs for something  do you

deem me to be so devoid of power and influence that you disdain to make

me your confidante  



 i know  madame   rejoined ascanio   that you enjoy all the power which

you deserve  but no human power will avail to help me in my present

plight  



 tell me all the same   said the duchess   i insist   then  with

fascinating coquetry  softening her voice and her expression  she added 

 i beseech you  



 alas  alas  madame   cried ascanio  as his grief overflowed   alas 

since you speak so kindly to me  and since my departure will cover my

shame and tears  i will do  not as i should have done yesterday  address

a prayer to the duchess  but make a confidante of the woman  yesterday i

would have said   i love colombe  and i am happy   to day i will say 

 colombe does not love me  and there is nothing left for me to do but to

die   adieu  madame  and pity me  



ascanio hurriedly kissed madame d etampes s hand  as she stood mute and

motionless  and vanished 



 a rival  a rival   said anne  as if awaking from a dream   but she does

not love him  and he shall love me  for i will have it so  oh yes  i

swear that he shall love me  and that i will kill benvenuto  





 footnote 5 



standing alone beside my window 

one morning as the day was breaking 

i saw at my left hand aurora

to phœbus pointing out his daily road 

and on the other hand my sweetheart combing

her golden locks  i saw her beaming eyes

that shone so lovingly upon me 

that i was fain to cry aloud 

 immortal gods  return to your abodes celestial 

her loveliness doth put yours to the blush

xiv





wherein it is proven that sorrow is the

groundwork of the life of man





we ask pardon for the bitter misanthropy of this title  it is the fact

that the present chapter will exhibit scarcely any other coherent

principle than sorrow  and therein will resemble life  the reflection is

not new  as a celebrated character in comic opera would say  but it is

consoling  in that it will perhaps he accepted as an apology by the

reader  whom we are about to lead  even as virgil led dante  from

despair to despair 



no offence is intended either to the reader or to virgil 



our friends  in very truth  at the moment at which we have now arrived 

mere all  beginning with benvenuto and ending with jacques aubry 

plunged in melancholy  and we are about to see them gradually engulfed

in the dark rising tide of sorrow 



we left benvenuto exceedingly anxious concerning ascanio s condition  on

his return to the grand nesle  he thought but little of the wrath of

madame d etampes  i promise you  his sole preoccupation was his dear

invalid  so it was that his joy knew no hounds when the door opened to

give admission to a litter  and ascanio  leaping lightly to the ground 

grasped his hand  and assured him that he was no worse than in the

morning  but benvenuto s brow quickly grew dark at the apprentice s

first words  and he listened with an expression of peculiar

dissatisfaction while the younger man said   



 master  i propose to show you that you have done a wrong for which you

must make amends  and i am sure that you will thank me instead of

hearing me ill will for it  you are mistaken with relation to madame

d etampes  she neither despises nor hates you  on the contrary  she

honors and admires you  and you must agree that you were very rude in

your treatment of her   a woman and a duchess  master  madame d etampes

is not only as beautiful as a goddess  she is as kind as an angel 

modest and enthusiastic  simple minded and noble  and at heart her

disposition is lovely  what you deemed insulting insolence this morning

was nothing more than childish mischief  i implore you  for your own

sake  you surely would not be unjust  as well as for mine  whom she made

welcome and cared for with such touching kindness  not to persist in

your insulting contempt for her  i will answer for it that you will have

no difficulty in persuading her  but you do not answer me  dear master 

you shake your head  can it be that i have wounded you  



 hark ye  my child   rejoined benvenuto gravely   i have often told you

that in my view there is but one thing in the world forever beautiful 

forever young  forever fruitful  and that is art divine  and yet  i

think  i hope  i know  that in certain tender hearts love also counts

for much   a deep and noble sentiment  which may make happy a whole

life  but it is very rare  for what is love in most cases  a fancy of a

day  a joyous intimacy  in which both parties are deceived  and very

often in the best of faith  i make sport of this love  as it is called 

ascanio  with great freedom as you know  i laugh at its high flown

pretensions and its stilted language  i do not slander it  to say truth 

it rather pleases me  it has  in petto  all the joy  all the sweetness 

all the jealousy of a serious passion  but its wounds are not mortal 

comedy or tragedy  after a certain time one hardly remembers it save as

a sort of theatrical performance  and then  ascanio  while women are

charming creatures  to my mind all save a very few do not deserve and do

not understand anything more than this passing fancy  to give them more 

one must be a dupe or an imprudent fool  take scozzone  for example  if

she should enter my heart  she would be terrified at what she saw

therein  i leave her at the threshold  and she sings and dances  she is

light of heart and happy  moreover  ascanio  these ever changing

alliances have a less durable basis  which however is all sufficient for

the artist   the worship of form  and the adoration of pure beauty  that

is their serious side  and it is on account of that i say no ill of

them  although i laugh at them  but  ascanio  mark this  there are other

passions which do not make me laugh  but make me tremble   terrible 

insensate passions  as impossible as things we see in dreams  



 mon dieu   thought ascanio   can he have learned aught of my mad

passion for colombe  



 they afford neither pleasure nor happiness   continued cellini   and

yet they take possession of one s whole being  they are vampires which

slowly drink your whole existence  which devour your heart little by

little  they hold you in a deathly embrace  and you cannot extricate

yourself  ascanio  ascanio  beware of such a passion   t is clear that

they are mere chimeras  and that they can in no way profit one  and yet

men who know this well plunge into them body and soul  and abandon their

lives to them almost with joy  



 he has that in his mind  he knows all   said ascanio to himself 



 my dear son   pursued benvenuto   if there still is time  break these

bonds which would hold you fast forever  you will bear the mark of them 

but try at least to save your life  



 who told you that i love her  in god s name   demanded the apprentice 



 if you do not love her  god be praised   exclaimed benvenuto  thinking

that ascanio denied the impeachment  when he simply asked a question 

 beware at all events  for i saw this morning that she loves you  



 this morning  of whom are you speaking  what do you mean  



 of whom am i speaking  of madame d etampes  



 madame d etampes   echoed the bewildered apprentice   why  master you

are wrong  it s not possible  you say that you saw that madame d etampes

loves me  



 ascanio  i am forty years old  i have lived  and i know whereof i

speak  by her manner of looking at you  by the favorable opinion which

she has succeeded in leading you to form of her  i would dare swear that

she loves you  and from the enthusiasm with which you defended her just

now i was much afraid that you had fallen in love with her as well  in

that case  dear ascanio  you would be lost  her love  hot enough to

consume your whole being  when it left you  would leave you with no

illusion  no faith  no hope  and you would have no other resource but to

love others as you had been loved yourself  and to carry to other hearts

the havoc that had been wrought in your own  



 master   said ascanio   i do not know whether ha dame d etampes loves

me  but i am perfectly sure that i do not love madame d etampes  



benvenuto was no more than half convinced by ascanio s apparent

sincerity  for he thought that he might be deceived as to his own

feelings  he said nothing more on the subject  and in the days which

followed often gazed at the apprentice with a sad face 



it should be said  however  that he did not seem to be troubled

exclusively on ascanio s account  he gave every indication of being

tormented by some personal distress  he lost his frank  joyous manner 

and no longer indulged in his original pranks of former days  he always

secluded himself during the forenoon in his room over the foundry  and

had given explicit orders that he should not be disturbed there  the

rest of the day he worked at the gigantic statue of mars with his

accustomed ardor  but without talking about it with his accustomed

effusiveness  especially in ascanio s presence did he seem gloomy 

embarrassed  and almost shamefaced  he seemed to avoid his dear pupil as

if he were his creditor or his judge  in short  it was easy to see that

some great sorrow or some great passion had found its way into that

manly heart  and was laying it waste 



ascanio was hardly more happy  he was persuaded  as he had said to

madame d etampes  that colombe did not love him  comte d orbec  whom he

knew only by name  was  in his jealous thoughts  a young and attractive

nobleman  and messire d estourville s daughter  the happy betrothed of a

well favored  nobly born lover  had never for an instant thought of an

obscure artist  even if he had retained the vague and fleeting hope

which never deserts a heart overflowing with love  he had himself

destroyed his last chance if madame d etampes was really in love with

him  by disclosing to her the name of her rival  this proposed marriage 

which she might perhaps have prevented  she would now do everything in

her power to hasten forward  and poor colombe would feel the full force

of her hatred  yes  benvenuto was right  that woman s love was in very

truth a terrible and deadly thing  but colombe s love would surely be

the sublime  celestial sentiment of which the master had first spoken 

and alas  that immeasurable blessing was destined for another 



ascanio was in despair  he had believed in madame d etampes s

friendship  and now it seemed that this deceitful friendship was a

dangerous passion  he had hoped for colombe s love  and it seemed that

her supposititious passion was nothing more than indifferent friendship 

he felt that he almost hated both these women  who had so falsified his

dreams in that each of them regarded him as he would have liked to be

regarded by the other 



entirely absorbed by a feeling of hopeless discouragement  he did not

once think of the lily ordered by madame d etampes  and in his jealous

anger he would not repeat his visit to the petit nesle  despite the

entreaties and reproaches of ruperta  whose innumerable questions he

left unanswered  sometimes  however  he repented of the resolution he

made on the first day  which was assuredly cruel to none but himself  he

longed to see colombe  to demand an explanation  but of what  of his own

extravagant visions  however  he would see her  he would think in his

softer moments  he would confess his love to her as a crime  and she was

so tender hearted that perhaps she would comfort him as if it were  a

misfortune  but how explain his absence  how excuse himself in the

maiden s eyes 



ascanio allowed the days to pass in innocent  sorrowful reflections  and

did not dare to take any decided step 



colombe awaited ascanio s coming with mingled terror and joy on the day

following that on which dame perrine floored the apprentice with her

direful revelation  but in vain did she count the hours and the minutes 

in vain did dame perrine keep her ears on the alert  ascanio  who had

recovered in good time from his swoon  and might have availed himself of

colombe s gracious permission  did not come  attended by ruperta  and

give the preconcerted signal at the door in the wall of the petit nesle 

what did it mean 



it meant that ascanio was ill  dying perhaps  at all events too ill to

come  at least that was what colombe thought  she passed the whole

evening kneeling at her prie dieu  weeping and praying  and when she

ceased to pray she found that she continued to weep  that discovery

terrified her  the anxiety which oppressed her heart was a revelation to

her  indeed  there was sufficient cause for alarm  for in less than a

month ascanio had taken possession of her thoughts to such a degree as

to make her forget her god  her father  and her misery 



but there was room in her mind for nothing now but this  ascanio was

suffering within two steps of her  he would die before she could see

him  it was no time to reason  but to weep and weep  if he should be

saved  she would reflect 



the next day it was still worse  perrine watched for ruperta  and as

soon as she saw her leave the house rushed out to go to market for news

far more than for supplies  now ascanio was no longer seriously ill  he

had simply refused to go to the petit nesle  without replying to dame

ruperta s eager questions otherwise than by obstinately keeping silent 

the two gossips were reduced to conjectures  such a thing was entirely

incomprehensible to them 



colombe  however  did not seek long for the explanation  she said to

herself at once   



 he knows all  he has learned that in three months i shall be comte

d orbec s wife  and he has no wish to see me again  



her first impulse was to be grateful to her lover for his anger  and to

smile  let him explain this secret joy who can  we are simply the

historian  but soon  upon reflection  she took it ill of ascanio that he

was able to believe that she was not in despair at the thought of such

a union 



 so he despises me   she said to herself 



all these impulses  indignant or affectionate  were very dangerous  they

laid bare the heart which before knew not itself  colombe said to

herself aloud  that she did not desire to see ascanio  but she

whispered  that she awaited his coming to justify herself  she suffered

in her timorous conscience  she suffered in her misapprehended love 



it was not the only passion which ascanio did not understand  there was

another more powerful  more impatient to make itself known  and which

dreamed darkly of happiness  as hatred dreams of vengeance 



madame d etampes did not believe  did not choose to believe  in

ascanio s profound passion for colombe 



 a child who has no conception of what he really wants   she said to

herself   who falls in love with the first pretty girl he sees  who has

come in collision with the high and mighty airs of an empty headed

little fool  and whose pride takes offence at the least obstacle  oh 

when he realizes what true love is  ardent  clinging love   when he knows

that i  duchesse d etampes  whose caprice rules a kingdom  love

him   ah  but he must know it  



the vicomte de marmagne and the provost of paris suffered in their

hatred  as anne and colombe suffered in their love  they harbored mortal

enmity to benvenuto   marmagne especially  benvenuto had caused him to

be despised and humiliated by a woman  benvenuto constrained him to be

brave  for before the scene at the hôtel d etampes the viscount might

have had him poniarded by his people on the street  but now he must

needs go and beard him in his own house  and marmagne shuddered with

dismay at the prospect  we do not readily pardon those who force us to

realize that we are cowards 



thus all were suffering  even scozzone  scozzone the madcap laughed and

sang no more  and her eyes were often red with weeping  benvenuto did

not love her  benvenuto was always cold  and sometimes spoke sharply to

her 



scozzone had for a long time had a fixed idea  which had become a

monomania with her  she was determined to become benvenuto s wife  when

she first went to him  expecting to serve him as a plaything  and he

treated her with all the consideration due a wife  and not as a mere

light o  love  the poor child was greatly exalted by such unlocked for

respect and honor  and at the same time she felt profoundly grateful to

her benefactor  and unaffectedly proud to find herself so highly

esteemed  afterward  not at benvenuto s command  but in response to his

entreaty  she gladly consented to serve him as model  and by dint of

seeing her own form and features so often reproduced  and so often

admired  in bronze  in silver  and in gold  she had simply attributed

half of the goldsmith s success to herself  for the lovely outlines 

which were so loudly praised  belonged to her much more than to the

master  she blushed with pleasure when benvenuto was complimented upon

the purity of the lines of this or that figure  she complacently

persuaded herself that she was indispensable to her lover s renown  and

had become a part of his glory  even as she had become a part of his

heart 



poor child  she did not dream that she had never been to the artist that

secret inspiration  that hidden divinity  which every creator evokes 

and which makes him a creator  because benvenuto copied her graceful

attitudes  she believed in good faith that he owed everything to her 

and little by little she took courage to hope that  after raising the

courtesan to the rank of mistress  he would raise the mistress to the

rank of wife 



as dissimulation was altogether foreign to her character  she had avowed

her ambition in very precise terms  cellini listened to her gravely  and

replied   



 this requires consideration  



the fact was that he would have preferred to return to the castle of san

angelo at the risk of breaking his leg a second time in making his

escape  not that he despised his dear scozzone  he loved her dearly  and

sometimes a little jealously  as we have seen  but he adored art before

everything  and his true and lawful wife was sculpture first of all 

furthermore  when he should be married  would not the husband depress

the spirits of the gay bohemian  would not the  pater familias 

interfere with the freedom of the sculptor  and  again  if he must marry

all his models  he would commit bigamy a hundred times over 



 when i cease to love scozzone  and to need her as a model   he said to

himself   i will find some worthy fellow for her  too short sighted to

look back into the past and to divine the future  who will see nothing

but a lovely woman and the marriage portion i will give her  thus i will

satisfy her mania for wearing the name of wife  bourgeois fashion   for

benvenuto was convinced that scozzone s desire was simply to have a

husband  and that it mattered little to her who the husband might be 



meanwhile  he left the ambitious damsel to take what comfort she could

in her fancies  but since their installation at the grand nesle  her

eyes had been opened  and she realized that she was not so necessary to

cellini s life and work as she thought  for she could no longer with her

gayety dispel the cloud of melancholy which overhung his brow  and he

had begun to model a hebe in wax for which she was not asked to pose  at

last  the poor child   horribile dictu    had essayed to play the

coquette with ascanio in cellini s presence  and there had been not the

slightest drawing together of the eyebrows to bear witness to the

master s jealous wrath  must she then bid farewell to all her blissful

dreams  and become once more a poor  humiliated creature 



as to pagolo  if any one cares to sound the depths of his heart  we

venture to say that he had never been more gloomy and taciturn than of

late 



it may be imagined that the hilarious student  jacques aubry  had

escaped this contagious depression of spirits  not at all  he had his

own cause for rejoining  simonne  after waiting a long while for him on

the sunday of the siege of nesle  returned to the conjugal mansion in a

rage  and had since stubbornly refused to meet the impertinent embryo

lawyer upon any pretext whatsoever  he  in revenge  had withdrawn his

custom from his capricious charmer s husband  but that disgusting

tradesman evinced at the news no other sentiment than the keenest

satisfaction  for although jacques aubry wore out his clothes quickly

and recklessly  always excepting the pockets  we must add that his

guiding economical maxim was never to pay for them  when simonne s

influence was no longer exerted as a counterpoise to the absence of

money  the selfish tailor concluded that the honor of dressing jacques

aubry did not compensate him for the loss he suffered by dressing him

for nothing 



thus our poor friend found himself at one and the same time bereft of

his love and cut short in his supply of clothing  luckily  as we have

seen  he was not the man to wither away in melancholy  he soon fell in

with a charming little consolation named gervaise  but gervaise was

bristling all over with principles of all sorts  which to his mind were

most absurd  she eluded him again and again  and he wore his heart out

in devising means to bring the flirt to her senses  he almost lost the

power to eat and drink  especially as his infamous landlord  who was own

cousin to his infamous tailor  refused to give him credit 



thus all whose names have figured prominently in these pages were sorely

ill at ease   from the king  who was very anxious to know whether

charles v  would or would not conclude to pass through france  to dame

perrine and dame ruperta  who were much put out at their inability to

continue their gossip  if our readers  like jupiter of old  had the

wearisome privilege of listening to all the complaints and all the

wishes of mankind  they would hear a plaintive chorus something like

this   



jacques aubry   if gervaise would only cease to laugh in my face  



scozzone   if benvenuto would only have one pang of jealousy  



pagolo   if scozzone could only bring herself to detest the master  



marmagne   if i might have the good fortune to surprise cellini alone  



madame d etampes   if ascanio only knew how i love him  



colombe   if i could see him for one moment   long enough to justify

myself  



ascanio   if she would only explain  



benvenuto   if i dared confess my agony to ascanio  



all   alas  alas  alas  









xv





wherein it appears that joy is nothing more

than sorrow in another form





all these longings were to be gratified before the end of the week  but

their gratification was destined to leave those who had formed them more

unhappy and more melancholy than ever  such is the universal law  every

joy contains the germ of sorrow 



in the first place gervaise ceased to laugh in jacques aubry s face  a

change most ardently desired by the student  as the reader will

remember  jacques aubry had discovered the golden fetters which were to

bind the damsel to his chariot  they consisted in a lovely ring carved

by benvenuto himself  and representing two clasped hands 



it should be said that  since the day of the siege  jacques aubry had

conceived a warm friendship for the outspoken and energetic nature of

the florentine artist  he did not interrupt him when he was

speaking   an unheard of thing  he kept his eyes fixed upon him and

listened to him with respect  which was more than he had ever consented

to do for his professors  he admired his work with an enthusiasm which 

if not very enlightened  was at least very warm and sincere  on the

other hand  his loyalty  his courage  and his jovial disposition

attracted cellini  he was just strong enough at tennis to make a good

fight  but to lose in the end  he was his match at table  within a

bottle  in short he and the goldsmith had become the best friends in the

world  and cellini  generous because his wealth was inexhaustible  had

one day forced him to accept this little ring  which was carved with

such marvellous skill that  in default of the apple  it would have

tempted eve  and sown discord between peleus and thetis 



on the morrow of the day when the ring passed from jacques aubry s hands

to those of gervaise  gervaise resumed a serious demeanor  and the

student hoped that she was his  poor fool  on the contrary  he was hers 



scozzone succeeded  as she desired  in kindling a spark of jealousy in

benvenuto s heart  this is how it came about 



one evening  when her wiles and coquetries had as usual failed to arouse

the master from his imperturbable gravity  she assumed a solemn

expression herself 



 benvenuto   said she   it seems to me  do you know  as if you had

forgotten your promise to me  



 what promise is that  my dear child   rejoined benvenuto  apparently

seeking an explanation of her reproach from the ceiling 



 haven t you promised a hundred times to marry me  



 i don t remember it  



 you don t remember it  



 no  i should say that my only reply was   this requires

consideration   



 well  have you considered it  



 yes  



 with what result  



 that i am still too young to be anything else than your lover 

scozzone  we will speak of it again later  



 and i am no longer foolish enough  monsieur  to be content with so

vague a promise as that  and to wait for you forever  



 do as you please  little one  and if you are in so great a hurry  go

ahead  



 but what prejudice have you against marriage  after all  why need it

make any change in your life  you will have made a poor girl  who loves

you  happy  that s all  



 what change will it make in my life  scozzone   said benvenuto gravely 

 you see yonder candle  whose pale flame but feebly lights this great

room where we are  i place an extinguisher over it  and now it is quite

dark  marriage would do the same to my life  light the candle again 

scozzone  i detest the darkness  



 i understand   cried scozzone volubly  bursting into tears   you bear

too illustrious a name to give to a poor girl  a nobody  who has given

you her heart and her life  all that she had to give  and is ready to

suffer everything for you  who lives only in your life  who loves only

you   



 i know it  scozzone  and i assure you that i am as grateful as

possible  



 who has gladly done her best to enliven your solitude  who  knowing

your jealous disposition  never looks at the cavalcades of handsome

archers and sergeants  who has always closed her ears to the soft words

which she has not failed to hear  nevertheless  even here  



 even here   rejoined benvenuto 



 yes  here  even here  do you understand  



 scozzone   cried benvenuto   it s not one of my comrades  i trust  who

has dared so to insult his master  



 he would marry me if i would let him   continued scozzone  attributing

cellini s wrath to a rejuvenescence of his love for her 



 scozzone  tell me the insolent varlet s name  it s not ascanio  i

hope  



 there is a man who has said to me more than a hundred times 

 catherine  the master abuses you  he will never marry you  sweet and

pretty as you are  he is too proud for that  oh  if he loved you as i

love you  or if you would love me as you love him   



 give me his name  the traitor s name   cried benvenuto 



 but i simply would not listen to him   continued scozzone  enchanted at

the success of her stratagem   on the contrary  all his soft words were

wasted  and i threatened to tell you all if he kept on  i loved only

you  i was blind  and the gallant got nothing by his fine speeches and

his languishing looks  oh  put on your indifferent air  and pretend not

to believe me  it is all true  none the less  



 i do not believe you  scozzone   said benvenuto  who saw that  if he

desired to know his rival s name  he must employ a very different method

from any he had hitherto attempted 



 what  you don t believe me  



 no  



 you think that i am lying  



 i think that you are mistaken  



 in your opinion  then  it s not possible for any one to love me  



 i don t say that  



 but you think it  



benvenuto smiled  for he saw that he had found a way to make catherine

speak 



 but there is some one who loves me  and that s the truth   continued

scozzone 



benvenuto made another gesture indicating incredulity 



 he loves me more than you ever loved me  more than you ever will love

me  monsieur  do you understand  



benvenuto began to laugh heartily 



 i am very curious to know who this gallant médor is   he said 



 his name is not médor   retorted catherine 



 what then   madis  



 nor amadis  his name is   



 galaor  



 his name is pagolo  if you must know  



 aha  so it s monsieur pagolo   muttered cellini 



 yes  it s monsieur pagolo   rejoined scozzone  wounded by the

contemptuous tone in which cellini uttered his rival s name    a boy of

good family  sedate  quiet  devout  and who would make a most excellent

husband  



 is that your opinion  scozzone  



 yes  it is my opinion  



 and yet you have never given him any hope  



 i have never listened to him  oh  i was a great fool  but after this   



 you are right  scozzone  you should listen to him  and reply to him  



 how so  what s that you say  



 i bid you listen when he speaks to you of love  and not turn him away 

i will attend to the rest  



 but   



 but  never fear  i have my plan  



  à la bonne heure   but i hope you don t propose to punish him very

severely  poor devil  he acts as if he were confessing his sins when he

says   i love you   play him a trick  if you choose  but not with your

sword  i ask mercy for him  



 you will be content with my vengeance  scozzone  for it will turn to

your advantage  



 in what way  



 it will help to gratify one of your fondest desires  



 what do you mean  benvenuto  



 that is my secret  



 oh  if you knew what an absurd figure he cuts when he tries to be

tender   said the volatile creature  incapable of remaining sad five

minutes in succession   and so  naughty man  you are still interested to

know whether any one is paying court to your giddy girl  you do still

love poor scozzone a little  



 yes  but do not fail to follow the instructions i give you in regard to

pagolo to the letter  



 oh  don t be afraid  i can play a part as well as another  it won t be

long before he will say to me   catherine  are you still cruel   and i

will reply   what  again  monsieur pagolo   but in a not very indignant

tone  you understand   encouraging rather  when he sees that i am no

longer harsh  he will think he s conquered the world  but what shall you

do to him  benvenuto  when shall you begin to take your revenge upon

him  will it be long drawn out  and very amusing  shall we laugh  



 yes  we shall laugh   benvenuto replied 



 and you will always love me  



benvenuto imprinted an assenting kiss upon her forehead   the best of

all answers  since it answers for everything without answering for

anything 



poor scozzone did not suspect that cellini s kiss was the beginning of

his vengeance 



the vicomte de marmagne s wish that he might find benvenuto alone was

also gratified  this is how it came about 



spurred on by the provost s anger  goaded by the memory of madame

d etampes s disdain  and influenced above all by his inordinate avarice 

the viscount  having resolved to attack the lion in his den with the aid

of his two sbirri  selected for his enterprise saint eloy s day  when

the studio was likely to be deserted  as it was a holiday in the

goldsmith s guild  he was proceeding along the quay  with his head high 

and his heart beating fast  his two bravos walking ten steps behind him 



 well  well   said a voice at his side   here s a fine young gentleman

on amorous conquest bent  with his valorous bearing for the lady  and

his two sbirri for the husband  



marmagne turned  thinking that some one of his friends was speaking to

him  but he saw only a stranger who was going in the same direction as

himself  but whom in his absorption he had failed to observe 



 i ll wager that i have guessed the truth  my fair sir   continued the

stranger   i will bet my purse against yours  without knowing what it

contains  that you are out on some such errand  oh  tell me nothing 

it s one s duty to be circumspect in love  my own name is jacques aubry 

my profession  student  and i am on my way at present to an appointment

with my sweetheart  gervaise philipot  a pretty girl  but  between

ourselves  of appalling virtue  which suffered shipwreck  however  upon

a certain ring  to be sure the ring was a jewel  and a jewel of

marvellous workmanship  nothing less than one of benvenuto cellini s

own  



until then the vicomte de marmagne had hardly listened to the

confidences of his loquacious interlocutor  and had been careful not to

reply  but his interest was aroused by the name of benvenuto cellini 



 one of benvenuto cellini s carvings  the devil  that s a royal gift for

a student to make  



 oh  pray understand  my dear baron  are you baron  count  or viscount  



 viscount   said marmagne  biting his lips at the impertinent

familiarity with which the student assumed to address him  but anxious

to find out if he could not procure some valuable information from him 



 pray understand  my dear viscount  that i did not buy it  no  although

i m an artist in my way  i don t put my money into such trifles 

benvenuto himself gave it to me in acknowledgment of my lending him a

hand last sunday to take the grand nesle from the provost  



 then you are cellini s friend   marmagne inquired 



 his most intimate friend  viscount  and i glory in it  between

ourselves it s a friendship for life and death  doubtless you also know

him  



 yes  



 you are very fortunate  a sublime genius  is he not  my dear fellow 

pardon me  i say   my dear fellow   but it s simply my way of speaking 

besides i think that i am nobly born  too   at least my mother used to

tell my father so whenever he beat her  however  i am  as i told you 

the admirer  the confidant  the brother of the great benvenuto cellini 

and consequently a friend to his friends  and a foe to his foes  for my

sublime goldsmith doesn t lack foes  in the first place madame

d etampes  secondly  the provost of paris  the old villain  and thirdly 

a certain vicomte de marmagne  a great  lanky creature  whom you perhaps

know  and who proposes  so they say  to take possession of the

grand nesle  pardieu  he ll have a warm reception  



 benvenuto has heard of his claim  has he   queried marmagne  beginning

to take a very decided interest in the student s conversation 



 he has been warned  but  hold  i must  not tell you  so that the

aforesaid marmagne may receive the chastisement he deserves  



 from what you say i judge that benvenuto is on his guard  



 on his guard  why  benvenuto is always on his guard  he has come within

an ace of being assassinated  i don t know how many times  but  thank

god  he has always come safely out of it  



 what do you mean by on his guard  



 oh  i don t mean that he has a garrison  as that old poltroon of a

provost had  no  no  quite the contrary  indeed  he is entirely alone at

this moment as all the fellows have gone to vanvres for a holiday  i was

to go myself  and play a game of tennis with him  dear benvenuto 

unluckily gervaise s convenience conflicted with the great artist s  and

naturally  as you will agree  i gave the preference to gervaise  



 in that case i will take your place with benvenuto   said marmagne 



 do so  it will be a meritorious action on your part  go  my dear

viscount  and say to benvenuto from me that he will see me this evening 

three knocks  rather loud  is the signal  you know  he adopted that

precaution on account of that great oaf of a marmagne  who is likely  so

he imagines  to try to play him some scurvy trick  do you know this

vicomte de marmagne  



 no  



 ah  so much the worse  you might have described him to me  



 what for  



 so that i might suggest a little game with clubs to him  if i should

fall in with him  i don t know why it is  but although i never saw him 

do you know i particularly detest your marmagne  my dear fellow  and if

he ever falls in my way  i propose to pummel him in fine shape  but

pardon me  here we are at the augustins  and i am compelled to leave

you  by the way  what is your name  my friend  



the viscount walked away as if he did not hear the question 



 aha   said jacques aubry   it seems that we prefer to remain  incog  

that s the purest chivalry  or i don t know myself  as you please  my

dear viscount  as you please  



and jacques aubry thrust his hands in his pockets and strutted down rue

de battoir  at the end of which gervaise lived  whistling a student s

song 



the vicomte de marmagne continued his journey toward the grand nesle 



benvenuto was in fact alone  as jacques aubry had said  ascanio had

wandered away  i know not where  to dream  catherine had gone with

ruperta to visit one of her friends  and all the workmen and apprentices

were holiday making at vanvres 



the master was in the garden working at the clay model of his gigantic

statue of mars  whose colossal head could see the louvre over the roof s

of the grand nesle  when little jehan  who was on guard at the door for

the day  deceived by marmagne s manner of knocking  took him for a

friend  and admitted him with his two sbirri 



if benvenuto did not  like titian  work with his coat of mail upon his

back  he did  like salvator rosa  work with his sword at his side  and

his carbine within reach of his hand  marmagne therefore quickly

discovered that life had gained very little by surprising him  he had

simply surprised an armed man 



the viscount did not even try to dissemble his bravado born of

poltroonery  and when cellini  in an imperative tone which called for an

immediate reply  demanded why he had come upon his premises   



 i have no business with you   was his answer   i am the vicomte de

marmagne  i am the king s secretary  and here is an order from his

majesty   he added  holding a paper above his head   which allots a

portion of the grand nesle to me  i am here to make provision for

arranging to my taste that portion of the hotel which is allotted to me 

and which i shall occupy henceforth  



with that  marmagne  still followed by his two sbirri  stalked toward

the door of the château 



benvenuto seized his carbine  which was  as we have said  within his

reach  and with one bound stood in front of the door on the stoop 



 halt where you are   he cried in a terrible voice  stretching out his

right arm in marmagne s direction   one step more  and you re a dead

man  



the viscount at once stopped short  although after these preliminaries

we might perhaps have anticipated a desperate conflict 



but there are men to whom is given the power to strike terror to other

men s hearts  there is an indescribable something in their look  their

gestures  their attitude  as in the look  the gestures  and the attitude

of the lion  the air about them is instinct with awe  their power is

felt afar off  when they stamp upon the ground  clench their fists  knit

their brows  or inflate their nostrils  the boldest hesitate to attack

them  a wild beast  whose young are attacked  has but to bristle up and

breathe noisily to make the assailant tremble  the men of whom we speak

are living dangers  valiant hearts recognize their like in them  and go

straight forward to meet them  despite their secret emotion  but the

weak  the timid  the cowardly  recoil at sight of them 



now marmagne  as the reader has discovered  was not a valiant heart  and

benvenuto had all the appearance of a living danger 



and so when the viscount heard the redoubtable goldsmith s voice  and

observed the imperial gesture of the arm extended toward him  he

realized that death for himself and his two sbirri lay dormant in the

carbine  the sword  and the dagger with which he was armed 



furthermore  little jehan  seeing that his master was threatened  had

armed himself with a pike 



marmagne felt that his game was up  and that he would be only too

fortunate if he could extricate himself safe and sound from the wasps 

nest he had stumbled upon 



 it s all right  it s all right  messire goldsmith   he said   all that

we wanted was to know whether you were or were not disposed to obey his

majesty s orders  you scoff at them  and refuse to abide by them  very

good  we shall apply to some one who will find a way to compel their

execution  but do not hope that we shall do ourselves the honor of

bargaining with you   bonsoir   



  bonsoir    said benvenuto  with his hearty laugh   jehan  show these

gentlemen out  



the viscount and his two sbirri shamefacedly retreated from the

grand nesle  cowed by one man  and shown out by a mere boy 



such was the lamentable result of the fulfilment of the viscount s wish 

 if only i could find benvenuto alone  



as he had been even more cruelly treated by fate in the matter of his

desires than jacques aubry and scozzone  who did not even yet detect the

irony of destiny  our valorous viscount was furious 



 madame d etampes was right   he said to himself   and i am fain to

follow the advice she gave me  i must break my sword and sharpen my

dagger  this devil of a man is just what he is said to be  very

intolerant  and not at all agreeable  i saw it written plainly enough in

his eyes  that if i took another step i was a dead man  but in every

lost cause there is a possibility of revenge  look well to yourself 

master benvenuto  look well to yourself  



he proceeded to lay the blame upon his companions  who were tried men 

however  and would have asked nothing better than to earn their money

honestly  by slaying or being themselves slain  in retiring  they had

simply obeyed their master s orders  they promised to give a better

account of themselves in an ambuscade  but as marmagne  to shield his

own honor  claimed that the check he had met with was due to them  he

informed them that he did not propose to accompany them in their next

undertaking  and that they must go through with it alone as best they

could  it was the very thing they most desired 



having enjoined silence upon them concerning their recent experience  he

called upon the provost of paris  and informed him that he had concluded

that the surest way to avoid all suspicion was to postpone benvenuto s

punishment until some day when  as frequently happened  he ventured into

a lonely  deserted street with a considerable sum of money  or some

valuable piece of his handiwork  then it would be believed that he had

been murdered by robbers 



it now remains for us to see how the wishes of madame d etampes 

ascanio  and cellini were gratified to their increased sorrow 









xvi





a court





meanwhile ascanio had completed the design for his lily  and  perhaps

from mere curiosity  perhaps under the influence of the magnet which

attracts the wretched to those who sympathize with them  he at once

repaired to the hôtel d etampes  it was about two o clock in the

afternoon  and just at that hour the duchess was sitting upon her

throne  surrounded by a veritable court  but similar orders to those

which were given at the louvre relating to benvenuto  were given at the

hôtel d etampes for ascanio  he was therefore at once escorted to a

reception room  and his arrival was made known to the duchess 



she trembled with joy at the thought that the young man was about to see

her in all her splendor  and gave certain orders in a low tone to

isabeau  who had brought her the message  isabeau returned to ascanio 

took him by the hand without a word  led him into a corridor  raised a

heavy curtain  and gently pushed him forward  he found himself in the

duchess s salon  immediately behind the arm chair of the sovereign of

the mansion  who guessed his presence more by the thrill which ran

through her whole being than by the rustling of the curtain  and gave

him her fair hand to kiss over her shoulder  which his lips almost

touched in the position in which he stood 



the lovely duchess was  as we have said  surrounded by a veritable

court  at her right was seated the duke of medina sidonia  ambassador of

charles v   monsieur de montbrion  governor of charles d orléans  the

king s second son  was at her left  the rest of the company sat in a

circle at her feet 



with the leading personages of the kingdom  warriors  statesmen 

magistrates  artists   were assembled the leaders of the protestant

sect  which madame d etampes secretly favored  great nobles all  and

much courted  who had constituted themselves courtiers of the favorite 

it was a gorgeous throng  and dazzling to the eyes at first sight  the

conversation was enlivened with satirical remarks of all sorts

concerning diane de poitiers  mistress of the dauphin  and the bitter

enemy of madame d etampes  but anne took no part in this petty warfare

of quips and cranks  save by a word or two thrown in at random now and

then  as   softly  messieurs  softly  no abuse of madame diane  or

endymion will be angry   or   poor madame diane  she was married the day

i was born  



except for these sparks with which she lighted up the conversation 

madame d etampes hardly spoke to anybody beside her two neighbors  she

talked with them in undertones  but with great animation  and not so low

that ascanio  who was humble and abashed among so many great men  could

not hear her 



 yes  monsieur de montbrion   said she confidentially to her left hand

neighbor   we must make an admirable prince of your pupil  he is the

real king of the future  you know  i am ambitious for the dear child 

and i am engaged at this moment in carving out an independent

sovereignty for him in case god should take his father from us  henri

ii   a poor creature  between ourselves  will be king of france  so be

it  our king will be a french king  and we will leave madame diane and

paris to his elder brother  but we will take with us  with our charles 

the heart of paris  the court will be where i am  monsieur de montbrion 

i shall displace the sun  we shall have great painters like primaticcio 

charming poets like clement marot  who is fidgeting about yonder in his

corner without speaking  a sure proof that he would like an opportunity

to repeat some verses to us  all these people are at heart more vain

than selfish  and more thirsty for glory than for money  ant he who has

the greatest wealth  but he who will flatter them most freely  will have

them on his side  and he who has them will be always great  for they

will shed lustre upon any place upon which their rays fall  the dauphin

cares for naught but jousting  oh  well  let him keep the lances and

swords  and we will take the pens and the brushes with us  never fear 

monsieur de montbrion  i will never allow myself to be put down by

madame diane  the queen in expectancy  let her wait patiently till time

and chance give her kingdom  i shall have made one for myself twice

over meanwhile  what say you to the duchy of milan  there you will not

be very far from your friends at geneva  for i know that you are not

altogether indifferent to the new doctrine blown over from germany 

hush  we will speak of this again  and i will tell you things that will

surprise you  why has madame diane assumed to set herself up as

protectress of the catholics  she protects  i protest  that s the

difference between us  



with an imperative gesture and a meaning glance  madame d etampes

brought her confidences upon this subject to a close  leaving the

governor of charles d orléans sadly bewildered  he was on the point of

replying  nevertheless  but found that the duchess had already turned to

the duke of medina sidonia 



we have said that ascanio could hear all 



 well  monsieur l ambassadeur   so madame d etampes began   does the

emperor finally conclude to pass through france  he can hardly do

otherwise  to tell the truth  and a net on land is always preferable to

a yawning gulf at sea  his cousin henry viii  would have no scruples

about kidnapping him  and if he escaped the english he would fall into

the hands of the turk  by land the three protestant princes would oppose

his passage  what can he do  he must either proceed through france  or

else  cruel sacrifice   forego the chastisement of the rebels of ghent 

his dear compatriots  for our great emperor charles is a good burgher of

ghent  that is very evident in the slight respect which he has shown on

occasion for royal majesty  memories of that sort are what make him so

timid and circumspect to day  monsieur de medina  oh  we understand it

all  he fears that the king of france will avenge the prisoner in spain 

and that the prisoner at paris may pay the balance of the ransom due

from the prisoner of the escurial  o mon dieu  let his mind be at ease 

even if he does not comprehend our chivalrous loyalty  he has heard of

it  i trust  



 most assuredly  madame la duchesse   said the ambassador   we know the

loyalty of françois i  when left to his own devices  but we fear   



the duke paused 



 you fear his advisers  do you not   rejoined the duchess   yes  yes 

oh  i know very well that advice from a pretty mouth  advice which

should take a clever and satirical form  would never fail of influence

upon a king s mind  it is your duty to think of that  monsieur

l ambassadeur  and take your precautions accordingly  after all  you

must have full powers  or  if not full powers  a little paper signed in

blank  wherein a good many things can be inserted in a few words  we

know how it s done  we have studied diplomacy  indeed  i once asked the

king to make me an ambassador  for i believe that i have a decided

talent for negotiation  yes  i am sure that it would be very painful for

charles v  to give up a slice of his empire in order to obtain his

release  or to assure his inviolability  on the other hand  flanders is

one of the fairest jewels of his crown  it is the inheritance of his

mother  marie de bourgogne  and it is hard to renounce the patrimony of

one s ancestors with a stroke of the pen  especially when that patrimony

is a great duchy  which may well be transformed into a little monarchy 

but what am i saying  mon dieu  i  who have a perfect horror of

politics  for it is universally agreed that politics and women do not go

well together  to be sure  i let fall a word or two thoughtlessly now

and then on affairs of state  but if his majesty presses me and insists

upon my expressing my thoughts more fully  i beg him to spare me such

tiresome discussions  and sometimes i run away and leave him alone to

dream upon them  you  clever diplomatist that you are  and who know

mankind so well  will tell me that these words tossed into the air are

just the ones which take root in minds like the king s  and that such

words  which are supposed to have been blown away by the wind  almost

always have more weight than a long harangue which is not listened to 

that may be  monsieur le duc de medina  that may be  but i am only a

poor woman  engrossed with ribbons and gewgaws  and you understand all

these serious matters a thousand times better than i  but the lion may

have need of the ant  the skiff may save the ship  we are here to come

to an understanding  monsieur le duc  and that s all we have to do  



 if you choose  madame   said the ambassador   it will be very quickly

done  



 who gives to day receives to morrow   continued the duchess  evading a

direct reply   my womanly instinct will always lead me to advise

françois i  to perform great and generous deeds  but instinct often

turns its back on reason  we must also think of our interest  of the

interest of france  of course  but i have confidence in you  monsieur de

medina  i will ask your advice  and upon the whole i think that the

emperor will do well to rely upon the king s word 



 ah  if you were in our interest  madame  he would not hesitate  



 master clement marot   said the duchess  abruptly breaking off the

conversation  as if she had not heard the ambassador s last exclamation 

 master clement marot  do you not happen to have some flowing madrigal 

or some stately sonnet to repeat to us  



 madame   said the poet   sonnets and madrigals are natural flowers

beneath your feet  and grow apace in the sunshine of your lovely eyes 

half a score of lines have come to my mind simply from looking into

them  



 indeed  master  very good  we will listen to them  ah  messire le

prévôt  welcome  pray forgive me for not seeing you at once  have you

news of your future son in law  our friend comte d orbec  



 yes  madame   replied d estourville   he writes that he is to hasten

his return  and we shall soon see him  i trust  



a half suppressed sigh made madame d etampes start  but she said 

without turning toward its author   



 he will be welcomed by us all  well  vicomte de marmagne   she

continued   have you found the sheath of your dagger  



 no  madame  but i am on the trace of it  and i know how and where to

find it now  



 good luck to you then  monsieur le vicomte  good luck to you  are you

ready  master clement  we are all ears  



 the subject is the duchy of etampes   said marot 



a murmur of approval ran through the room  and the poet recited the

following lines in an affected voice   





 ce plaisant val que l on nomme tempé

dont mainte histoire est encore embellie 

arrosé d eau  si doux  si attrempé 

sachez que plus il n est en thessalie 

jupiter  roi qui les cœurs gagne et lie 

l a de thessale en france remué 

et quelque peu son propre nom mué 

car pour tempé veut qu etampes s appelle 

ainsi lui plait  ainsi l a situé

pour y loger de france la plus belle   7 





madame d etampes clapped her hands and smiled  and all the hands and all

the lips applauded after her 



 faith   said she   i see that jupiter transported pindarus to france

when he transported tempe  



with that the duchess rose  and all the company followed suit  she was

fully justified in deeming herself the veritable queen  and it was a

true queenly gesture with which she took leave of her guests  and it was

as a queen that all sainted her as they withdrew 



 remain   she said in a low voice to ascanio 



ascanio obeyed 



but when all the others had left the room  it was no haughty and

disdainful queen  but an humble and passionate woman  who turned and

confronted the young artist 



ascanio  born of humble parents  brought up far from the world  in the

almost cloister like twilight of the studio  and an unaccustomed guest

in palaces  whither he had accompanied his master only on rare

occasions  was already giddy  confused  dazzled by the light and noise

and conversation  his mind was attacked by something very like vertigo

when he heard madame d etampes speak in such simple terms  or rather so

coquettishly  of such grave subjects  and touch lightly in familiar

phrase upon the destinies of kings and the dismemberment of kingdoms 

the woman  like a very providence  had in some sort distributed to each

one his portion of joy or sorrow  she had with the same hand rattled

fetters and let crowns fall  and lo  this sovereign of the loftiest

earthly things  proud as lucifer with her noble flatterers  turned to

him not only with the soft glance of the loving woman  but with the

suppliant air of the slave who fears  ascanio had suddenly become the

leading character in the play  instead of a simple spectator 



it should be said that the coquettish duchess had skilfully planned and

brought about this effect  ascanio was conscious of the empire which

this woman assumed  despite his efforts to combat it  not over his

heart  but over his mind  and like the child that he was  he sought to

hide his trouble beneath a cold  stern demeanor  it may perhaps be that

he had seen his spotless colombe pass like a ghost between the duchess

and himself   colombe with her white robe and her luminous brow 





 footnote 7 



that lovely valley called the vale of tempe 

whose refreshing shade doth many a tale adorn 

watered by cool and limpid streamlets 

is no more to be found in thessaly 

for jupiter  the king who conquers hearts and binds them 

has bodily transported it from thessaly to france 

and in a slight degree has changed its name 

for  tempe  read  etampes   such is his will 

and he hath so ordained  and placed it there 

that there might dwell she who is france s loveliest

love as passion





 madame   said ascanio   you requested me to design a lily  do you

remember  you ordered me to bring the design to you as soon as it should

be completed  i completed it this morning  and i have it here  



 we have time enough  ascanio   said the duchess  with a smile  and in a

siren s voice   sit you down  pray  well  my bonny invalid  what of your

wound  



 i am entirely recovered  madame  



 so far as your shoulder is concerned  but here   said the duchess 

laying her hand upon the young man s heart  with a graceful gesture  and

a world of sentiment in her tone 



 i beg you  madame  to forget all that nonsense  i am very angry with

myself for having annoyed your ladyship with it  



 o mon dieu  what means this air of constraint  what means this clouded

brow  and this harsh voice  all those men wearied you  did they not 

ascanio   and as for myself  i hate and abhor them  but i fear them  oh

how i longed to be alone with you  did you not see how quickly i

dismissed them  



 you are right  madame  i felt sadly out of place in such a

distinguished company  i  a poor artist  who am here simply to show you

this lily  



 ah  mon dieu  in a moment  ascanio   continued the duchess  slinking

her head   you are very cold  and very sober with a friend  the other

day you were so expansive and so delightful  why this change  ascanio 

doubtless some speech of your master s  who cannot endure me  how could

you listen to him  ascanio  come  be frank  you have discussed me with

him  have you not  and he told you that it was dangerous to trust me 

that the friendly feeling i had manifested for you concealed some snare 

he told you  did he not  that i detest you  



 he told me that you loved me  madame   retorted ascanio  looking

earnestly into her face 



madame d etampes was speechless for a moment  in presence of the

thoughts which rushed through her mind  she wished without doubt that

ascanio should know her love  but she would have liked time to prepare

him for it  and to extinguish gradually  without seeming interested in

so doing  his passion for colombe  how that the ambuscade she had

arranged was discovered  she must fight her battle in the broad

daylight  and win the victory openly if at all  she made her decision in

a second 



 well  yes   said she   i do love you  is it a crime  is it a sin even 

can one command one s love or hatred  you should never nave known that i

love you  for why tell you  when you love another  but that man revealed

the whole truth  he laid bare my heart to you  and he did well  ascanio 

look upon it  and you will see there adoration so deep that you can but

be touched by it  and now  ascanio  you must love me too  mark that  



anne d etampes  a potent  superior nature  disdainful by instinct and

ambitious from weariness of her surroundings had had several lovers

hitherto  but not one love  she had fascinated the king  admiral brion

had taken her by surprise  the comte de longueval caught her fancy for

the moment  but throughout all these intrigues the head had always taken

the place of the heart  at last  one day she found this young  true

love  tender and deep  which she had so often summoned without avail 

and now another woman disputed its possession with her  ah  so much the

worse for that other woman  she could not know what an irresistible

passion she had to contend with  all the determination and all the

violent impulses of her heart  she  anne d etampes  would make manifest

in her affection  that woman did not yet know what a fatal thing it

would be to have the duchesse d etampes for her rival  the duchesse

d etampes  who desired to have her ascanio to herself  and whose power

was such that she could  with a look  a word  a gesture  crush whatever

might come between him and herself  the die was cast  the ambition and

the beauty of the king s mistress were thenceforth to serve no other

masters than her love for ascanio and her jealousy of colombe 



poor colombe  at that moment bending over her embroidery  sitting at her

spinning wheel  or kneeling before her prie dieu 



ascanio  in presence of so outspoken and so redoubtable a passion  felt

fascinated  carried away  and dismayed  all at the same moment 

benvenuto had said  and ascanio now realized  that this was no mere

whim  but he was deficient  not in the strength to struggle  but in the

experience which would have taught him to feign submission  he was

hardly twenty years old  and was too candid to pretend  he fancied  poor

child  that the memory of colombe  the name of the innocent girl uttered

by him  would be an offensive and defensive weapon  a sword and a

shield  while on the other hand it was sure to drive the shaft still

deeper into the heart of madame d etampes  who perhaps would soon have

grown weary of a love in which she had no rival and no battle to wage 



 come  ascanio   she resumed more calmly  seeing that the young man held

his peace  alarmed perhaps by the words she had let fall   let us for

to day forget my love  which an imprudent word of yours inopportunely

awakened  let us think now of yourself only  oh  i love you more on your

own account than mine  i swear to you  i long to brighten your life as

you have brightened mine  you are an orphan  take me for your mother 

you heard what i said to montbrion and medina  and you may have thought

that i am all ambition   t is true  i am ambitious  but for you alone 

how long is it since i conceived this project of creating an independent

duchy in the heart of italy for a son of france  only since i have loved

you  if i were queen there  who would be the veritable king  you  for

you i would cause empire and kingdom to change places  ah  ascanio  you

do not know me  you do not know what a woman i am  you see that i tell

you the whole truth  i unfold my plans to you without reserve  how do

you  in your turn  confide in me  ascanio  what are your wishes  that i

may fulfil them  what are your passions  that i may minister to them  



 madame  i desire to be as frank and loyal as yourself  and to tell you

the truth  as you have told it to me  i ask nothing  i wish nothing  i

long for nothing  save colombe s love  



 but she loves you not  you yourself told me so  



 i was desperate the other day  true  but to day who can say   ascanio

lowered his eyes and his voice   for you love me   he added 



the duchess was taken aback by this instance of the instinctive

divination of true love  there was a moment of silence  and that moment

sufficed for her to collect her thoughts 



 ascanio  let us not talk to day of affairs of the heart   she said   i

made that request once before  i make it again  love isn t the whole of

life to you men  for instance  have you never thirsted for wealth 

honors  glory  



 oh  yes  yes  for a month past i have most ardently longed for them  

replied ascanio  always reverting to the same idea in spite of himself 



again there was a pause 



 are you fond of italy   anne resumed with effort 



 yes  madame   said ascanio   there are flowering orange groves there 

beneath which it is so pleasant to wander and converse  there the bluest

of blue skies surrounds  caresses  and adorns everything that is

beautiful  



 oh  to fly thither with you   to have you all to myself   to be all in

all to you  as you would be all in all to me  mon dieu  mon dieu   cried

the duchess  likewise yielding to the irresistible force of her love 

but she at once recovered herself  fearing to frighten ascanio again 

and continued   i thought that you loved art before everything  



 before everything i love  to love   said ascanio   oh  it is my great

master cellini  not i  who throws his whole being into his work  he is

the great  the marvellous  the sublime artist  i am a poor apprentice 

nothing more  i came to france with him  not to acquire wealth  nor

glory  but because i loved him  that s all  and it was impossible for me

to part from him  for at that time he was everything to me  i have no

personal will  no strength independent of his strength  i became a

goldsmith to gratify him  and because he wished it  as i became a carver

because of his enthusiasm for skilful and delicate carving  



 very well   said the duchess   now listen  to live in italy 

all powerful  almost a king  to patronize artists  cellini at their

head  to give him bronze  and silver and gold  to carve and cast and

mould  and beyond all that  to love and be loved  say  ascanio  is it

not a lovely dream  



 it would be paradise  madame  if it were colombe whom i loved and who

loved me  



 still colombe  always colombe   cried the duchess   so be it  since the

subject persistently forces itself into our words and our thoughts 

since your colombe is here with us  constantly before your eyes  and

constantly in your heart  let us speak of her and of myself frankly and

without hypocrisy  she does not love you  and you know it full well  



 oh  no  i do not know it now  madame  



 but how can she love you when she is to marry another   cried the

duchess 



 her father forces her  perhaps  



 her father forces her  and do you think that if you loved me as you

loved her   do you think that if i were in her place there is in this

wide world any force or will or power that could keep us apart  oh  i

would leave everything  i would fly from everything  i would run to your

arms  and would give you my love  my honor  and my life to guard  no 

no  i say she does not love you  and now would you have me tell you

something else  you do not love her  



 what  i not love colombe  i think you said that i do not love her 

madame  



 no  you do not love her  you deceive yourself  at your age  one

mistakes the need of loving for love  if you had seen me first  you

would love me instead of her  oh  when i think that you might have loved

me  but no  no  it is much better that you should choose me in

preference to her  i do not know this colombe  she is lovely and pure 

and whatever you choose  but these slips of girls know nothing about

loving  your colombe would never have told you what i  whom you despise 

have just said  she would have too much vanity  too much diffidence  too

much shame perhaps  but my love is simple  and expresses itself in

simple words  you despise me  you think that i forget my sex  and all

because i don t dissemble  some day  when you know the world better 

when you have drunk so deeply of life that you have reached the

dregs   sorrow   then you will think better of your present injustice 

then you will admire me  but i do not choose to be admired  ascanio  i

choose to be loved  i say again  ascanio  if i loved you less  i might

be false  artful  coquettish  but i love you too well to try to

fascinate you  i long to receive your heart as a gift  not to steal it 

what will be the end of your love for that child  tell me  you will

suffer  my best beloved  and that s all  but i can serve you in many

ways  in the first place  i have suffered for two  and perhaps god will

permit my surplusage of suffering to be credited to you  and then i lay

my wealth  my power  my experience  all at your feet  i will add my life

to yours  and will save you from all sorts of missteps and from all

forms of corruption  to arrive at fortune  or even to attain glory  an

artist must often stoop to base  crawling expedients  you will be beyond

all necessity for that with me  i will lift you ever higher and higher 

i will be your stepping stone  with me you will continue to be the

proud  the noble  the pure ascanio  



 but colombe  colombe  madame  is not she too an immaculate pearl  



 my child  believe what i say   replied the duchess  relapsing from

feverish exaltation to melancholy   your pure white  innocent colombe

will make your life monotonous and dreary  you are both too divine  god

didn t make angels to be joined together  but to make bad people

better  



the duchess s manner was so eloquent  and her voice so sincere  that

ascanio was conscious of a thrill of affectionate compassion stealing

over him  in spite of himself 



 alas  madame   he said   i see that i am indeed honored by your

affection  and i am very deeply touched  but it is even better to love  



 oh  how true  how true that is  i prefer your disdain to the king s

softest words  ah me  i love for the first time  for the first time  i

swear  



 and the king  pray do you not love him  madame  



 no  i am his mistress  but he is not my master  



 but he loves you  



 mon dieu   cried anne  gazing earnestly into ascanio s face  and

seizing both his hands in hers   am i so fortunate that you are jealous 

does the king s love offend you  listen  hitherto i have been in your

eyes the duchess  wealthy  noble  powerful  offering to stir up crowned

heads and overturn thrones  do you prefer the poor  lonely woman  out of

the world  with a simple white robe  and a wild flower in her hair  do

you prefer that  ascanio  let us leave paris  the court  the world  let

us take refuge in some far off nook in your sunny italy  beneath the

lofty pines of rome  or on the shores of your lovely bay of naples  here

i am  i am ready  o ascanio  ascanio  does it really flatter your pride 

that i would sacrifice a crowned lover for your sake  



 madame   said ascanio  whose heart was beginning to melt in the flame

of so great a passion   madame  my heart is too proud and too exacting 

you cannot give me the past  



 the past  o you men  you men  always cruel  the past  in god s name

ought an unfortunate woman to be compelled to answer for her past  when

it has almost always been made what it was by events and circumstances

stronger than herself  suppose that a storm should arise and a whirlwind

carry you off to italy  when you return  one year  two years  three

years hence  should you take it ill of your colombe  whom you love so

dearly to day  because she had obeyed her parents and married comte

d orbec  would you make her virtue a subject of reproach  would you

punish her for obeying one of god s commandments  and if she had not

your memory to feed upon  if she had never known you   if  in her

deathly ennui  crushed with grief  forgotten for a moment by god  she

had sought to gain some knowledge of that paradise called love  the door

of which was closed to her   if she had loved another than her husband 

whom she could not love   if in a moment of delirium she had given her

heart in exchange for another   she would then be ruined in your eyes 

dishonored in your heart  she could no longer hope to be blessed by your

love  because she had not an unsullied past to give in exchange for your

heart  oh  i repeat  it is unjust  it is cruel  



 madame   



 who told you that is not my story  listen to what i say  and

believe what i declare to be the truth  i say again that i have suffered

for both  and this poor woman  whom god forgives  you refuse to forgive 

you do not understand how much greater and nobler it is to raise one s

self from the abyss after falling into it  than to pass close by without

seeing it  having the bandage of happiness over your eyes  o ascanio 

ascanio  i deemed you better than the others  because you were younger 

and fairer to look upon   



 o madame  



 reach me your hand  ascanio  and at one bound i will spring from the

bottom of the abyss to your heart  will you  to morrow i will have

broken with the king  the court  the world  oh  i am valiant in love 

but i do not wish to make myself any greater than i am  it would be but

a trifling sacrifice for me  believe me  all these men are not worth one

glance from you  but  if you would trust to me  dear child  you would

let me retain my authority  and continue my plans for you  i would make

you great  and you men can do without love if you attain glory  you are

ambitious   you may not know it yet  but you are  as for the king s

love  don t be alarmed about that  i will turn it aside upon some other

to whom he will give his heart while i retain his mind  choose  ascanio 

powerful through my means and with me  or i humble through your means

and with you  look you  a short time since  as you know  i was in this

chair  and the most powerful courtiers were at my feet  sit you in my

place  sit you there  and behold me at your feet  oh  how i love to be

here  ascanio  oh what bliss to see you and look into your eyes  you

turn pale  ascanio  oh  if you would but tell me that you would love me

some day  though not for a long  a very long while  



 madame  madame   cried ascanio  hiding his face in his hands  and

covering eyes and ears  so conscious was he of the potent fascination of

the aspect and the accent of the siren 



 do not call me madame  do not call me anne   said the duchess  putting

aside his hands   call me louise  it is also my name  but a name by

which no one has ever called me  and it shall be yours  louise 

louise   do you not think it a sweet name  ascanio  



 i know one sweeter still   replied ascanio 



 beware  ascanio   cried the wounded lioness   if you make me suffer too

keenly  i may perhaps come to hate you as much as i love you  



 mon dieu   replied the young man  shaking his head  as if to avert the

spell   mon dieu  you confuse my thoughts  and overwhelm my heart  am i

delirious  have i a fever  am i dreaming  if i say harsh things to you 

forgive me  for i do it to awaken myself  i see you  lovely  adored  a

queen  here at my feet  it cannot be that such temptations exist except

to lead souls to perdition  ah  you are  as you say  in an abyss  but

instead of rising out of it yourself  you would draw me in  oh  do not

expose my weakness to such a trial  



 there is neither temptation  nor trial  nor dream  there is a

resplendent reality for us both  i love you  ascanio  i love you  



 you love me  but you will repent of your love hereafter and will

reproach me some day for what you have brought into my life  or what i

have taken away from yours  



 ah  you do not know me   cried the duchess   if you think me weak

enough to repent  stay  will you have a pledge  



anne hastily seated herself at a table upon which were writing

materials  and  seizing a pen  dashed off a few words 



 take this   she said   and doubt me again  if you dare  



ascanio took the paper and read   





 ascanio  i love you  go with me where i go  or let

me go with you where you go 



 anne d heilly  





 oh  that cannot be  madame  it seems to me that my love would be a

cause of shame to you  



 shame   cried the duchess   do i know shame  i am too proud for that 

my pride is my virtue  



 ah  i know a lovelier and more saintly virtue than that   said ascanio 

clinging to the thought of colombe with a desperate effort 



the blow struck home  the duchess rose  trembling with indignation 



 you are an obstinate  hard hearted child  ascanio   she said in a

broken voice   i would fain have spared you much suffering  but i see

that sorrow alone can teach you what life is  you will come back to me 

ascanio  you will return wounded  bleeding  heartbroken  and you will

know then the worth of your colombe and of myself  i will forgive you

then  because i love you  but ere that time comes terrible things will

happen   au revoir   



and madame d etampes  wild with love and hatred  left the room 

forgetting that the two lines she had written in a moment of exaltation

remained in ascanio s hands 









xviii





love as a dream





as soon as ascanio was out of madame d etampes s presence  the

fascinating influence which emanated from her disappeared  and he could

once more see clearly the condition of his own heart  as well as what

was going on about him  how  he recalled two things he had said  colombe

might love him  since the duchesse d etampes loved him  thenceforth his

life did not belong to him  his instinct had served him well in

suggesting these two thoughts to him  but it had led him astray when it

inspired him to give utterance to them  if the honest  upright soul of

the young man had been capable of descending to dissimulation  all would

have been well  but he had simply put the wounded and much to be dreaded

duchess on her guard  the struggle henceforth was to be the more

terrible  in that colombe only was threatened 



however  this passionate and perilous scene with the duchess was of

service to ascanio in one respect  he carried away from it a new born

feeling of exaltation and confidence  his mind  excited by the spectacle

it had witnessed as well as by its own efforts  was more active than

ever  and more inclined to audacious deeds  so that he gallantly

determined to find out what basis there might be for his hopes  and to

sound the depths of colombe s heart  though he were to find nothing more

than indifference there  if colombe really loved comte d orbec  why

contend longer against madame d etampes  she might do what she would

with a rebellious  despised  desolate  despairing existence  he would be

ambitious  he would become gloomy and evil minded  what matter if he

did  but first of all he must put an end to his doubts  and go with a

determined step to meet his fate  if worse came to worst  madame

d etampes s promise would take care of the future 



ascanio arrived at this decision as he returned along the quay  watching

the sun sink in a sea of flame behind the black  frowning tour de nesle 

when he reached the hôtel  without delay or hesitation  he went first

to put together a few jewels  then resolutely knocked four times at the

door leading to the petit nesle 



dame perrine chanced to be in the neighborhood  with astonishment 

mingled with curiosity  she made haste to open the gate  but when she

saw the apprentice  she felt called upon to assume a very frigid

demeanor 



 ah  is it you  monsieur ascanio  what do you wish  



 i wish to show these jewels to mademoiselle colombe immediately  good

dame perrine  is she in the garden  



 yes  in her path  but wait  young man  wait for me  



ascanio  who had not forgotten the road  walked swiftly away without

giving another thought to the governess 



 let us see   said she  stopping to reflect   i think my best course is

not to join them  but to leave colombe free to select her purchases and

her gifts  it would not be becoming for me to be there  if  as is

probable  she puts something aside for me  i will arrive when she has

completed her purchases  and then i should certainly be very ungrateful

to refuse  that s what i ll do  stay here and not embarrass the dear 

kind hearted child  



it will be seen that the good woman was not deficient in delicacy 



for ten days past colombe had not found it necessary to ask herself if

ascanio had become her dearest thought  the pure souled  unsophisticated

child did not know what love was  but her heart was overflowing with

love  she told herself that she did wrong to indulge in such dreams  but

she excused herself on the ground that she certainly should never see

ascanio again  and that she should not have the consolation of

justifying herself in his eyes 



upon this pretext she passed all her evenings upon the bench where he

had sat beside her  and there she would talk to him  listen to him  and

concentrate her whole soul upon the memory  and when the darkness came

on  and dame perrine bade her retire  the lovely dreamer would return to

the house with reluctant steps  and not until she was recalled to

herself would she remember her father s commands  comte d orbec  and the

rapid flight of time  her sleepless nights were hard to bear  but not

sufficiently so to efface the charm of her visions of the evening 



on this evening  as usual  colombe was living over again the delicious

hour she had passed with ascanio  when  happening to raise her eyes  she

uttered a sharp cry 



he was standing before her  gazing at her in silence 



he found her changed  but lovelier than ever  pallor and melancholy were

most becoming to her ideally beautiful face  she seemed to belong still

less to earth  and so ascanio  gazing admiringly upon her enhanced

charms  was assailed once more by his former modest apprehensions  which

madame d etampes s passion had dissipated for a moment  how could this

celestial creature ever love him 



the two lovely children  who had loved each other so long without a

word  and who had already suffered so much  were at last face to face 

they ought  no doubt  to have traversed in an instant the space they had

traversed step by step  and separately  in their dreams  they might now

come to an understanding first of all  and then allow all their long

pent up emotion to find expression in an outburst of joy 



but they were both too timid for that  and although their emotion

betrayed each to the other  their angel hearts did not come together

until they had first made a detour 



colombe  speechless and blushing  had risen to her feet by a sudden

impulse  ascanio  pale with the intensity of his emotion  repressed with

a trembling hand the rapid beating of his heart 



they both began to speak at once  he to say   forgive me  mademoiselle 

but you gave me leave to show you some jewels   she to say   i am glad

to see that you are entirely recovered  monsieur ascanio  



they ceased speaking simultaneously  but nevertheless they had perfectly

understood each other  and ascanio  emboldened by the involuntary smile

which the incident naturally brought to the maiden s lips  rejoined 

with somewhat more assurance   



 are you so kind as to remember that i was wounded  



 indeed  yes  and dame perrine and i have been very anxious and

astonished not to see you  



 i did not intend to come again  



 why not  pray  



at this decisive moment ascanio was fain to lean against a tree for

support  but in a moment he summoned all his strength and all his

courage  and said breathlessly   



 i may confess it now  i loved you  



 and now  



the question came from colombe s lips almost without her knowledge  it

would have put to flight all the doubts of an older hand than ascanio 

but it simply revived his hopes a little 



 now  alas   he continued   i have measured the distance that lies

between us  and i know that you are happily betrothed to a noble count  



 happily   interposed colombe  with a bitter smile 



 what  you do not love the count  great god  pray tell me  is he not

worthy of you  



 he is rich and powerful  far above me  but you have seen him  



 no  and i was afraid to inquire  besides  i cannot say why  but i felt

certain that he was young and attractive  and that he was agreeable to

you  



 he is older than my father  and he frightens me   said colombe  hiding

her faee in her hands with a gesture of abhorrence which she could not

repress 





 illustration 04 





ascanio  beside himself with joy  fell on his knees  with clasped hands 

pale as death  his eyes half closed  but a sublime light shone out from

beneath his eyelids  and a smile fit to rejoice god s heart played about

his colorless lips 



 what is the matter  ascanio   said colombe in alarm 



 what is the matter   cried the young man  finding in the excess of his

joy the audacity which sorrow first gave him   what is the matter  why 

i love you  colombe  



 ascanio  ascanio   murmured colombe  in a tone that was half reproof 

half pleasure  and it must be said  as soft as a confession of love 



but they understood each other  their hearts were united  and before

they were conscious of it  their lips had followed suit 



 my friend   said colombe  softly pushing ascanio away 



they gazed into one another s faces in ecstasy  the two angels

recognized each other at last  life does not contain two such moments 



 and so   said ascanio   you do not love comte d orbec  you are free to

love me  



 my friend   said colombe  in her sweet  grave voice   no one save my

father ever kissed me before  and he  alas  very rarely  i am an

ignorant child  and i know nothing of life  but i know from the thrill

which your kiss caused me that it is my duty henceforth to belong only

to you or to heaven  yes  if it were otherwise  i am sure that it would

be a crime  your lips have consecrated me your  fiancée  and your wife 

and though my father himself should say no  i would listen only to the

voice of god  which says yes in my heart  here is my hand  which is

yours  



 angels of paradise  hear her and envy me   cried ascanio 



such ecstasy is not to be pictured or described  let those who can

remember  remember  ft is impossible to put upon paper the words  the

looks  the hand pressures of these pure hearted lovely children  their

spotless souls flowed together  as do the waters from two springs 

without changing their nature or their color  ascanio did not sully with

the shadow of an impure thought the chaste brow of his beloved  colombe

laid her head in perfect trust upon her lover s shoulder  had the virgin

mary looked down upon them from on high she would not have turned her

head away 



when one begins to love  one is in haste to bring to the support of his

love all that he can of his past  present  and future  as soon as they

could speak calmly  ascanio and colombe described to each other all

their sorrows  all their hopes  of the days just gone by  it was

charming to both to find that each had the other s story to tell  they

had suffered much  and they smiled upon each other as they remembered

their suffering 



but when they came to speak of the future  then they became serious and

sad  what had god in store for them for the morrow  according to all

divine laws they were made for each other  but human prejudices would

declare their union ill assorted  monstrous  what were they to do  how

persuade comte d orbec to renounce his wife  how persuade the provost of

paris to give his daughter to an artisan 



 alas  my friend   said colombe   i promised you that i would belong to

you or to heaven   i see that it must be to heaven 



 no   said ascanio   to me  two children like ourselves cannot move the

world alone  but i will speak to my dear master  benvenuto cellini  he

is powerful  colombe  and sees all things from a higher level  he acts

on earth as god ordains in heaven  and whatever his will has undertaken

he accomplishes  he will give you to me  i do not know how he will do

it  but i am sure  he loves obstacles  he will speak to king françois 

he will persuade your father  the only thing he could not bring to pass

you did without his intervention   you loved me  the rest ought to be

very simple  you see that i believe in miracles now  my best beloved  



 dear ascanio  you hope and i hope  would you like me also to try an

experiment  there is a person whose influence over my father s mind is

unbounded  shall i not write to madame d etampes  



 madame d etampes   cried ascanio   mon dieu  i had forgotten her  



thereupon he told her  simply and without affectation  how he had seen

the duchess  how she had declared her love for him  and how  that very

day  within an hour  she had pronounced herself the enemy of his

beloved  but of what consequence was it  benvenuto s task would be a

little more difficult  that was all  one adversary more would not

terrify him 



 my dear   said colombe   you have faith in your master  and i have

faith in you  speak to cellini as soon as possible  and let him decide

our fate  



 to morrow i will tell him everything  he loves me so well that he will

understand me instantly  but what is it  my colombe  how sad you are  



each sentence of ascanio s narrative had made colombe doubly conscious

of her love for him by forcing the sharp sting of jealousy into her

heart  and more than once she convulsively pressed ascanio s hand  which

she held in her own 



 ascanio  madame d etampes is very beautiful  she is beloved by a great

king  mon dieu  did she make no impression upon your heart  



 i love you   said ascanio 



 wait here for me  



she returned a moment later with a beautiful fresh white lily 



 when you are working at that woman s lily of gold and jewels   said

she   glance sometimes at the simple lilies from your colombe s garden  



with that she put her lips to the flower and handed it to the

apprentice  as coquettishly as madame d etampes herself could have done 



at that moment dame perrine appeared at the end of the path 



 adieu and  au revoir    said colombe  putting her hand to her lover s

lips with a furtive  graceful gesture 



the governess approached them 



 well  my child   she said to colombe   have you given the delinquent a

good scolding  and selected your jewels  



 take this  dame perrine   said ascanio  putting the box of trinkets in

the good woman s hands still unopened   mademoiselle colombe and i have

decided that you shall yourself choose whatever suits you best  and i

will come again to morrow for the others  



with that he ran off with his joy  darting a farewell glance at colombe 

which told her all that he had to tell 



colombe sat with her hands folded upon her breast as if to confine the

happiness it contained   while dame perrine was making her choice among

the marvels brought by ascanio 



alas  the poor child was very soon and very cruelly awakened from her

sweet dreams 



a woman appeared  escorted by one of the provost s men 



 monseigneur le comte d orbec  who is to return day after to morrow  

said this woman   places me at madame s service from to day  i am

familiar with the newest and prettiest styles  and i am commanded by

monsieur le comte and messire le prévôt to make for madame a

magnificent brocade gown  as madame la duchesse d etampes is to present

madame to the queen on the day of her majesty s departure for

saint germain  four days hence  



after the scene we have described  the reader may imagine the despairing

effect of this twofold news upon colombe 









xix





love as an idea





the next morning at daybreak ascanio  resolved to place his destiny in

his master s hands at once  repaired to the foundry where cellini worked

every morning  but as he was about to knock at the door of what the

master called his cell  he heard scozzone s voice  he supposed that she

was posing  and he discreetly withdrew  to return a little later 

meanwhile he walked about the gardens of the grand nesle  reflecting

upon what he should say to cellini  and what cellini would probably say

to him 



but scozzone was not posing   far from it  she had never before set foot

in the cell  to which no one  to her great disappointment  was ever

admitted  so it was that the master s wrath was terrible to behold 

when  happening to turn his head  he saw catherine behind him  with her

great eyes open wider than ever  the imprudent damsel s desire to see

found little to gratify it  after all  a few drawings upon the walls  a

green curtain before the window  a statue of hebe begun  and a

collection of sculptor s utensils  comprised the whole contents of the

room 



 what do you want  little serpent  why have you come here  in god s name

will you follow me to hell   cried benvenuto at sight of catherine 



 alas  master   said scozzone  in her softest voice   i assure you i am

not a serpent  i confess that rather than part from you i would joyfully

follow you to hell if necessary  and i come here because it is the only

place where i can speak to you in secret  



 very well  make haste  what have you to say to me  



 o mon dieu  benvenuto   exclaimed scozzone  spying the outlined statue 

 what an admirable figure  it is your hebe  i had no idea it was so far

advanced  how lovely it is  



 is it not   said benvenuto 



 ah  yes  very lovely  and i understand that you would not want me to

pose for such a subject  but who is your model   inquired scozzone 

anxiously   i have not seen any woman go in or out  



 hush  come  my dear girl  you surely did not come here to talk of

sculpture  



 no  master it s about our pagolo  i did as you bade me  benvenuto  he

took advantage of your absence last evening to annoy me with his eternal

love  and  as you commanded  i listened to him to the end  



 aha  the traitor  what did he say to you  



 oh  it s enough to make one die with laughing  and i would have given

anything in the world could you have been there  please understand that 

in order not to arouse suspicion  the hypocrite finished the clasp you

had given him to make  while he was speaking to me  and the file that he

held in his hand added not a little to the pathos of his speech 



  dear catherine   said he   i am dying for love of you  when will you

take pity on my martyrdom  one word  i only ask for one word  just see

to what i expose myself for your sake  if i had not finished this clasp 

the master might suspect something  and if he suspected anything he

would kill me without mercy  but i defy everything for your lovely eyes 

jésu  this accursed work doesn t advance at all  after all  catherine 

what good does it do you to love benvenuto  he doesn t thank you for it 

he is always indifferent to you  and i would love you with a love which

would be so ardent and so circumspect at the same time  no one would

discover it  you would never be compromised  and you could rely on my

discretion  whatever might happen  look you   he added  made bold by my

silence   i have already found a safe retreat  hidden from every eye 

where i could take you without fear    ha  ha  you would never guess the

place the sly rascal had selected  benvenuto  i give you a hundred  a

thousand guesses  none but men with hang dog looks  and eyes on the

ground discover such out of the way corners  he proposed to quarter

me   where do you suppose   in the head of your great statue of mars 

 we can go up   he said   with a ladder   he assured me that there is a

very pretty apartment there  out of every one s sight  and with a

magnificent view of the surrounding country  



 faith  it s not a bad idea   said benvenuto  with a laugh   and what

reply did you make  scozzone  



 i replied with a great burst of laughter  which i could not keep back 

and which sorely disappointed mons  pagolo  he undertook then to be very

pathetic  to reproach me with having no heart  and with wishing to cause

his death  and so forth  and so forth  all the time working away with

hammer and file  he talked to me in that strain for a full half hour 

for he s a loquacious rascal when he gives his mind to it  



 what reply did you give him finally  scozzone  



 what reply  just as you knocked at the door  and he placed his clasp 

finished at last  upon the table  i took his hand  and said to him very

soberly   pagolo  you have talked like a jewel   that was why you found

him looking so like an idiot when you came in  



 you were wrong  scozzone  you should not have discouraged him so  



 you told me to listen to him and i listened  do you think it s so very

easy for me to listen to handsome boys  suppose something should happen

some fine day  



 you should not only listen to him  my child  but you must give him an

answer  it is indispensable to my plan  speak to him at first without

anger  then indulgently  and then encouragingly  when you have reached

that point  i will tell you what else you must do  



 but that may have results you do not intend  do you know  at least you

should be there  



 never fear  scozzone  i will appear at the right moment  you have only

to rely upon me  and follow my instructions to the letter  go now 

little one  and leave me to my work  



catherine tripped lightly away  laughing in pleased anticipation of the

fine trick cellini proposed to play upon pagolo  of the nature of which 

however  she could not form the least conception 



benvenuto  when she had left him  did not resume his work  as he had

said  he rushed to the window which looked obliquely upon the garden of

the petit nesle  and stood there in rapt contemplation  a knock at the

door rudely aroused him from his reverie 



 hail and tempest   he cried in a rage   who is there now  can i not be

left in peace  ten thousand devils  



 forgive me  master   said ascanio s voice   if i disturb you  i will go

away  



 what  is it you  my child  no  no  surely not  you never disturb me 

what is it  pray  what do you want with me  



benvenuto lost no time in opening the door for his beloved pupil 



 i interfere with your solitude and your work   said ascanio 



 no  ascanio  you are always welcome  



 master  i have a secret to confide to you  a service to ask of you  



 speak  will you have my purse  do you need my arm or my thoughts  



 i may have need of them all  dear master  



 so much the better  i am yours body and soul  ascanio  i have a

confession to make to you  too  yes  a confession  for although i have

committed no sin  i think  still i shall have some remorse until i am

absolved by you  but do you speak first  



 very well  master   but  great heaven  what is that cast   cried

ascanio  interrupting himself 



his eye had just fallen upon the statue of hebe  and in the statue he

recognized colombe 



 it is hebe   replied benvenuto  with glistening eyes   it is the

goddess of youth  do you think it beautiful  ascanio  



 oh  wonderful  but those features  i know them  i cannot be mistaken  



 rash boy  since you raise the veil half way  i must needs snatch it

away altogether  and so  after all  your confidence will come after

mine  sit down  ascanio  you shall have my heart spread out before you

like an open book  you need me  you say  i  too  need that you should

hear me  i shall be relieved of a great weight when you know all  



ascanio sat down  paler than the culprit about to listen to the reading

of the death sentence 



 you are a florentine  ascanio  and i do not need to ask you if you know

the story of dante alighieri  one day he saw a child named beatrice

passing along the street  and he loved her  the child died and he loved

her still  for it was her soul that he loved and souls do not die  but

he crowned her with a crown of stars  and placed her in paradise  that

done  he set about analyzing human passions  sounding the depths of

poetry and philosophy  and when  purified by suffering and

contemplation  be readied the gates of heaven  where virgil  that is 

wisdom  was to leave him  he was not obliged to stop for lack of a

guide  because he found beatrice  that is  love  awaiting him on the

threshold 



 ascanio  i have my beatrice  dead like the other  and adored as she

was  this has been hitherto a secret between god and her and myself  i

am weak to resist temptation  but my adoration for her has remained

intact amid all the impure passions to which i have yielded  i had

placed my light too high for corruption to reach it  the man plunged

heedlessly into dissipation  the artist remained true to his mysterious

betrothal  and if i have done anything creditable  ascanio   if inert

matter  silver or clay  has been made to assume form and life under my

fingers  if i have sometimes succeeded in imparting beauty to marble and

life to bronze   it has been because my resplendent vision has given me

counsel  support  and instruction for twenty years past 



 but i know not how it is  ascanio  perhaps there is a distinction

between the poet and the goldsmith  between the moulder of ideas  and

the moulder of gold  dante dreams  i need to see  the name of maria is

all sufficient to him  i must have before me the face of the madonna  we

divine his creations  we touch mine  that perhaps is why my beatrice was

not enough  or rather was too much for me  a sculptor  her mind was ever

present with me  but i was compelled to seek the human form  the angelic

woman who shed a bright light upon my life had been beautiful  most

certainly  beautiful above all in the qualities of her heart  but she

did not realize the type of undying beauty upon which my imagination

dwelt  i found myself constrained therefore to seek elsewhere  to

invent 



 now  tell me this  ascanio  do you think that  if my sculptor s ideal

had presented itself to me living on this earth  and if i had bestowed a

share of my admiration upon it  i should have been ungrateful and

faithless to my poetic ideal  do you think that my celestial apparition

would in that case have ceased to visit me  that the angel would be

jealous of the woman  do you think it  i ask you the question  ascanio 

and you will know some day why i ask it of you rather than of

another   why i tremble as i await your reply  as if you were my

beatrice herself  



 master   said ascanio gravely and sadly   i am too young to have an

opinion upon such lofty subjects  i think  however  in my heart  that

you are one of the chosen men whom god leads  and that what you find

upon your path has been placed there by god  not by chance  



 that is really your belief  is it not  ascanio  you are of opinion that

the terrestrial angel  the realization of my longing  would be sent by

god  and that the other celestial angel would not be angry at my

desertion  in that case  i may venture to tell you that i have found my

ideal  that it is living  that i can sec it  and almost touch it 

ascanio  the model of all beauty  of all purity  the type of infinite

perfection to which we artists aspire  is near at hand  it breathes  and

i can admire  it every day  ah  all that i have done hitherto is as

nothing compared with what i will do  this hebe  which you think

beautiful  and which is  in very truth  my  chef d œuvre   does not

satisfy me as yet  my living dream stands beside its image  and seems to

me a hundred times more glorious  but i will attain it  i will attain

it  ascanio  a thousand white statues  all of which resemble it  are

already forming and rising in my brain  i see them  i feel their

presence  and some day they will come forth 



 and now  ascanio  would you like me to show you my lovely inspiration 

it should be close by us  every morning  when the sun rises  it shines

upon me from below  look  



benvenuto drew the curtain aside from the window  and pointed to the

garden of the petit nesle 



in her leafy avenue colombe was walking slowly along  her head resting

upon her hand 



 how fair she is  is she not   said benvenuto ecstatically   phidias and

old michel angelo created nothing purer  and the ancients  if they

equal  do not surpass that graceful young head  how beautiful she is  



 ah  yes  beautiful indeed   murmured ascanio  who had resumed his seat 

without strength to move or to think 



there was a moment s pause  while benvenuto feasted upon his joy  and

ascanio brooded over his pain 



 but  master   the apprentice timidly ventured to say   where will this

artist s passion lead you  what do you mean to do  



 ascanio   replied cellini   she who is dead is not and cannot be mine 

god simply showed her to me  and did not implant any human love for her

in my heart  strangely enough  he did not even lead me to feel what she

was to me until he had taken her from the world  she is naught but a

memory in my life  a vague  indistinct image  but if you have understood

me  colombe more nearly touches my existence  my heart  i dare to love

her  i dare to say to myself   she shall be mine  



 she is the daughter of the provost of paris   said ascanio  trembling 



 and even if she were a king s daughter  ascanio  you know what my will

is capable of  i have attained whatever object i have sought to attain 

and i never longed for aught more ardently  i know not as yet by what

means i shall gain my end  but she must be my wife  



 your wife  colombe your wife  



 i will apply to my mighty sovereign   continued benvenuto   i will

people the louvre and chambord with statues if he wishes  i will cover

his tables with ewers and candelabra  and when i ask no other price than

colombe he will not he françois i  if he refuses  o ascanio  i am

hopeful  i am hopeful  i will seek him in the midst of his whole court 

see  three days hence  when he starts for saint germain  you will come

with me  we will carry the silver salt box  which is completed  and the

designs for a gateway at fontainebleau  every one will admire them  for

they are fine  and he will admire them  and will marvel more than the

others  i will give him a similar surprise every week  i have never been

conscious of a more fruitful creative power  my brain is boiling night

and day  this love of mine  ascanio  has increased my power and renewed

my youth  when françois sees all his wishes gratified as soon as they

are formed   ah  then i will no longer request  but demand  he will make

me great  and i will make myself rich  and the provost of paris  for all

his provostship  will be honored by the alliance  upon my soul  ascanio 

i am going mad  such thoughts make me lose control of myself  she mine 

dreams of heaven  do you realize what it means  ascanio  colombe mine 

embrace me  my child  since i have confessed it all to you  i dare to

listen to my hopes  my heart is calmer now  you have in a measure

legalized my happiness  you will understand some day what i mean by

that  meanwhile  it seems to me that i love you more dearly since you

have received my confidence  it was good of you to listen  embrace me 

dear ascanio  



 but you do not seem to think  master  that perhaps she doesn t love

you  



 oh  hush  ascanio  i have thought of it  and then i have envied your

youth and beauty  but what you say of the far seeing designs of god

reassures me  she is waiting for me to come to her  whom should she

love  some courtier fop  altogether unworthy of her  furthermore 

whoever he may be for whom she is destined  i am as nobly born as he 

and i have more genius  



 comte d orbec  they say  is hex  fiancé   



 comte d orbec  so much the better  i know him  he is the king s

treasurer  and i go to him for the gold and silver to be used in my

work  and for the sums which his majesty s bounty allots to me  comte

d orbec is a crabbed  worn out old curmudgeon  he doesn t count  and

there will be little glory in supplanting such an animal  go to 

ascanio  it is i whom she will love  not for my sake  but for her own 

because i shall be the demonstration of her loveliness  so to speak 

because she will be appreciated  adored  immortalized  moreover  i have

said   i wish it   and  i say again  i never have used that phrase that

i have not succeeded  there is no human power which can hold out against

the energy of my passion  i shall  as always  go straight to my goal 

with the inflexibility of destiny  she shall be mine  i tell you  though

i have to turn the whole kingdom topsy turvy  and if perchance any rival

should block my way  demonio  let him beware  you know me  ascanio  i

will kill him with this hand now grasping thine  but forgive me 

ascanio  in god s name  egotist that i am  i forget that you have a

secret to confide to me  and a service to ask at my hands  i shall never

pay my debt to you  dear child  but say on  say on  for you  as well as

myself  i can do what it is my will to do  



 you are wrong  master  there are things which god alone can do  and i

know that i must rely upon him and none other  i will leave my secret 

therefore  between my feebleness and his might  



ascanio left the room 



he had hardly closed the door when cellini drew the green curtain  and 

placing his table by the window  began to model his hebe  his heart

filled with joy in the present  and a sense of security for the future

the trafficker in his own honor





it was the day on which colombe was to be presented to the queen 



the whole court was assembled in one of the state apartments at the

louvre  after hearing mass the court was to depart for saint germain 

and they were awaiting the coming of the king and queen to go to the

chapel  except a few ladies who were seated  everybody was moving about

from place to place  laughing and talking  there was the rustle of silks

and brocades  and the clash of swords  loving and defiant glances were

exchanged  together with arrangements for future meetings  of amorous or

deadly purport  it was a dazzling  bewildering scene of confusion and

splendor  the costumes were superb  and cut in the latest style  among

them  adding to the rich and interesting variety  were pages  dressed in

the italian or spanish fashion  standing like statues  with arms akimbo 

and swords at their sides  it was a picture overflowing with animation

and magnificence  of which all that we could say would be but a very

feeble and colorless description  bring to life all the dandified 

laughing cavaliers  all the sportive easy mannered ladies who figure in

the pages of brantôme and the  heptameron   put in their mouths the

crisp  clever  outspoken  idiomatic  eminently french speech of the

sixteenth century  and you will have an idea of this seductive court 

especially if you recall the saying of françois i    a court without

women is a year without spring  or a spring without flowers   the court

of françois i  was a perpetual spring  where the loveliest and noblest

of earthly flowers bloomed 



after the first bewilderment caused by the confusion and uproar  it was

easy to see that there were two hostile camps in the throng  one 

distinguished by lilac favors  was that of madame d etampes  the other 

whose colors were blue  hoisted the flag of diane de poitiers  those who

secretly adhered to the reformed religion belonged to the first faction 

the unadulterated catholics to the other  among the latter could be seen

the dull  uninteresting countenance of the dauphin  the intelligent 

winning  blonde features of charles d orléans  the king s second son 

flitted here and there through the ranks of the faction of madame

d etampes  conceive these political and religious antipathies to be

complicated by the jealousy of women and the rivalry of artists  and the

result will be a grand total of hatred  which will sufficiently explain 

if you are surprised at them  a myriad of scornful glances and

threatening gestures  which all the courtier like dissembling in the

world cannot conceal from the observation of the spectator 



the two deadly enemies  anne and diane  were seated at the opposite ends

of the room  but  notwithstanding the distance between them  not five

seconds elapsed before every stinging quip uttered by one of them found

its way to the ears of the other  and the retort  forwarded by the same

couriers  returned as quickly by the same road 



amid all these silk and velvet clad noblemen  in an atmosphere of clever

sayings  in his long doctor s robe  stern featured but indifferent 

walked henri estienne  devotedly attached to the cause of the

reformation  while not two steps away  and equally oblivious of his

surroundings  stood the florentine refugee  pietro strozzi  pale and

melancholy  leaning against a pillar  and gazing doubtless in his heart

at far off italy  whither he was destined to return in chains  there to

have no repose save in the tomb  we need not say that the nobly born

italian  a kinsman  through his mother  of catherine de medicis  was

heart and soul devoted to the catholic party 



there  too  talking together of momentous affairs of state  and stopping

frequently to look each other in the face as if to give more weight to

what they were saying  were old montmorency  to whom the king had given

less than two years before the office of constable  vacant since the

fall of bourbon  and the chancellor  poyet  bursting with pride over the

new tax he had imposed  and the ordinance of villers cotterets  just

countersigned by him  8 



mingling with none of the various groups  taking part in no

conversation  the benedictine and cordelier françois rabelais  with a

smile which showed his white teeth  watched and listened and sneered 

while triboulet  his majesty s favorite jester  rolled his humpback and

his biting jests around between the legs of the guests  taking advantage

of his pygmy like stature to bite here and there without danger  if not

without pain 



clement marot  resplendent in a brand new coat as  valet de chambre  to

the king  seemed fully as uncomfortable as on the day of his reception

at the hôtel d etampes  it was evident that he had in his pocket some

poor fatherless sonnet  which he was seeking to dress in the guise of an

impromptu conception  but alas  we all know that inspiration comes from

on high  and we cannot control it  a ravishing idea had come to his mind

unbidden upon the name of madame diane  he struggled against it  but the

muse is a mistress  not a lover  the lines formed themselves without his

assistance  the rhymes matched themselves to one another as if by some

magic power which he could not control  in fine  the wretched verses

tormented him more than we can say  he was devoted to madame d etampes

beyond question  and to marguerite de navarre   that too  was

incontestable   as was the fact that the protestant party was the one

toward which his sympathies leaned  it may even be that he was in search

of an epigram against madame diane  when this madrigal in her honor came

to his mind  but come it did  and how  we pray to know  when such superb

lines were evolved in his brain in laudation of a catholic  could he

forbear  despite his zeal for the protestant cause  to confide them in a

whisper to some appreciative friend of literary tastes 



that is what poor marot did  but the injudicious cardinal de tournon  to

whose bosom he intrusted his verses  deemed them so beautiful  so

magnificent  that  in spite of himself  he passed them on to m  le duc

de lorraine  who lost no time in telling madame diane of them  instantly

there was a great whispering among the partisans of the blue  in the

midst of which marot was imperatively summoned  and called upon to

repeat them  the lilacs  when they saw marot making his way through the

crowd toward madame diane  hastened in the same direction  and crowded

around the poet  enchanted and terrified at the same time  at last the

duchesse d etampes herself left her place  being curious  as she said 

to see how  that knave marot  9  who had so much wit  would set about

praising madame diane  



poor clement marot  as he was about to begin  after bowing low to diane

de poitiers  who smiled upon him  turned his head slightly to glance

about and caught the eye of madame d etampes  she also smiled upon him 

but the smile of the one was gracious  and of the other awe inspiring 

and so it was with a trembling and uncertain voice that poor marot 

burning up on one side  and frozen on the other  repeated the following

verses   





 etre phœbus bien souvent je désire 

non pour connaître herbes divinement 

car la douleur que mon cœur veut occire

ne se guérit par herbe aucunement 

non pour avoir ma place au firmament 

non pour son arc encontre amour laisir 

car à mon roi ne veux être rebelle 

être phœbus seulement je désir 

pour être aimé de diane la belle   10 





marot had barely littered the last syllable of this charming madrigal 

when the blues applauded vociferously  while the lilacs preserved a

deathly silence  thereupon  emboldened by the applause on the one hand 

and chagrined by the frigid reception accorded his effusion on the

other  he boldly presented the  chef d œuvre  to madame de poitiers 



 to  diane the fair    he said in an undertone  bowing to the ground

before her   you understand  madame  fair in your own right and by

contrast  



diane thanked him with her sweetest smile  and marot turned away 



 one may venture to write verses in praise of a fair one  after having

done the same in honor of the fairest   said the ill fated poet

apologetically as he passed madame d etampes   you remember  madame   de

france la plus belle   



anne replied with a withering glance 



two groups  composed of acquaintances of the reader  stood aloof from

the throng during this incident  in one were ascanio and cellini 

benvenuto was weak enough to prefer the  divina commedia  to airy

conceits  the other group consisted of comte d orbec  the vicomte de

marmagne  messire d estourville  and colombe  who had implored her

father not to mingle with the crowd  with which she then came in contact

for the first time  and which caused her no other sensation than terror 

comte d orbec gallantly refused to leave his  fiancée   who was to be

presented by the provost to the queen after mass 



ascanio and colombe  although they were equally bewildered by their

strange surroundings  had spied each other at once  and from time to

time stealthily exchanged glances  the two pure hearted  timid children 

both of whom had been reared in the solitude which makes noble hearts 

would have been isolated and lost indeed in that gorgeous and corrupt

throng  had they not been so situated that they could see and thereby

mutually strengthen and encourage each other 



they had not met since the day they confessed their love  half a score

of times ascanio had tried to gain admission to the petit nesle  but

always in vain  the new servant  presented to colombe by comte d orbec 

invariably answered his knock instead of dame perrine  and dismissed him

unceremoniously  ascanio was neither rich enough nor bold enough to try

to buy the woman  furthermore he had naught but sad news  which she

would learn only too soon  to impart to his beloved  the news of the

master s avowal of his own passion for colombe  and the consequent

necessity  not only of doing without his support  but perhaps of having

to contend against him 



as to the course to be pursued  ascanio felt  as he had said to cellini 

that god alone could now save him  and being left to his own resources

he had  in his innocence  resolved to attempt to soften madame

d etampes  when a hope upon which one has confidently relied is blasted 

one is always tempted to have recourse to the most desperate expedients 

the all powerful energy of benvenuto not only had failed ascanio  but

would undoubtedly be turned against him  ascanio determined  therefore 

with the trustfulness of youth  to appeal to what he believed he had

discovered of grandeur and nobleness and generosity in the character of

madame d etampes  in an attempt to arouse the sympathy of her by whom he

was beloved with his suffering  afterward  if that last fragile branch

slipped from his hand  what could he do  a poor  weak friendless child 

but wait  that was why he had accompanied benvenuto to court 



the duchesse d etampes had returned to her place  he joined the throng

of her courtiers  reached a position behind her  and finally succeeded

in making his way to her chair  chancing to turn her head  she saw him 



 ah  is it you  ascanio   she said  coldly 



 yes  madame la duchesse  i came hither with my master  benvenuto  and

my excuse for venturing to address you is my desire to know if you were

hopelessly dissatisfied with the drawing of the lily which you kindly

ordered me to prepare  and which i left at the hôtel d etampes the

other day  



 no  in very truth  i think it most beautiful   said madame d etampes 

somewhat mollified   and connoisseurs to whom i have shown it  notably

monsieur de guise here  are entirely of my opinion  but will the

completed work be as perfect as the drawing  and if you think that you

can promise that it will  will my gems be sufficient  



 yes  madame  i hope so  i should have liked  however  to place on the

heart of the flower a large diamond  which would glisten there like a

drop of dew  but it would be too great an expense perhaps to incur for a

work intrusted to an humble artist like myself  



 oh  we can indulge in that extravagance  ascanio  



 but a diamond of that size would be worth some two hundred thousand

crowns  madame  



 very well  we will reflect thereon  but   added the duchess  lowering

her voice   confer a favor upon me  ascanio  



 i am at your service  madame  



 a moment since  while listening to marot s insipid trash  i spied comte

d orbec at the other end of the room  find him out  if you please  and

say to him that i would speak with him  



 what  madame   exclaimed ascanio  turning pale at the count s name 



 did you not say that you were at my service   continued madame

d etampes haughtily   moreover  my reason for asking you to undertake

this commission is that you are interested in the subject of the

conversation i wish to have with comte d orbec  and it may well give you

food for reflection  if they who are in love do ever reflect  



 i will obey you  madame   said ascanio  apprehensive lest he should

displease her at whose hands he hoped to obtain salvation 



 very good  pray address the count in italian   i have my reasons for

requesting you to do so   and return to me with him  



ascanio  to avoid the danger of any further collision with his

redoubtable foe  walked away  and asked a young nobleman wearing a lilac

favor if he had seen comte d orbec  and where he was 



 there he is   was the reply   that old ape whispering with the provost

of paris  and standing so near that lovely girl  



the lovely girl was colombe  at whom all the dandies were gazing with

admiring curiosity  the old ape seemed to ascanio as repulsive a

creature as a rival could desire  after scrutinizing him for a moment he

walked up to him  and to colombe s unbounded amazement accosted him in

italian  requesting him to go with himself to madame d etampes  the

count excused himself to his fiancée and friends  and made haste to

obey the duchess s command  followed by ascanio  who did not take his

leave until he had bestowed a significant reassuring glance upon poor

colombe  who was confounded by the extraordinary message  and more than

all else by the sight of the messenger 



 ah  count  good morning   said madame d etampes  as her eye fell upon

d orbec   i am charmed to see you  for i have matters of importance to

discuss with you  messieurs   she added  addressing those who were

standing near   we have still a quarter of an hour to await the coming

of their majesties  and if you will allow me i will seize the

opportunity to talk with my old friend comte d orbec  



all the noblemen who had crowded about the duchess hastened to stand

discreetly aside  in obedience to this unceremonious dismissal  and left

her with the king s treasurer in one of the window embrasures  as large

as one of our salons of to day  ascanio was about to do as the rest did 

but  at a sign from the duchess  he remained 



 who is this young man   queried the count 



 an italian page who does not understand a word of french  you may speak

before him exactly as if we were alone  



 very well  madame   rejoined d orbec   i have obeyed your orders

blindly  without even seeking to know your motives  you expressed a wish

that my future wife should be presented to the queen to day  colombe is

here with her father  but  now that i have complied with your command  i

confess that i should be glad to understand it  do i presume too much 

madame  in asking you for some little explanation  



 you are the most devoted of my faithful friends  d orbec  happily there

is still much that i can do for you  but i do not know if i shall ever

be able to pay my debt to you  however  i will try  this treasurership

which i have given you is simply the corner stone upon which i propose

to build your fortune  count  



 madame   said d orbec  bowing to the ground 



 i am about to speak frankly to you  therefore  but before all let me

offer my congratulations  i saw your colombe just now  she is truly

ravishingly beautiful  a little awkward  but that adds to her charm  and

yet  between ourselves  i have racked my brain in vain   i know you  and

i cannot understand with what object you  a serious  prudent man  but

slightly enamored  i fancy  of youth and beauty  are entering into this

marriage  i say  with what object  for there must necessarily be

something underneath it  you are not the man to take such a step at

random  



 dame  one must settle down  madame  and the father is an old villain

who has ducats to leave to his daughter  



 but how old is he  pray  



 oh  some fifty five or six years  



 and you  count  



 about the same age  but he is so used up  



 i begin to understand  and to recognize your fine hand  i knew that you

were above mere vulgar sentiment  and that yonder child s fascinations

did not constitute the attraction for you  



 fie  madame  i have never even thought of them  if she had been ugly it

would have been all the same  she happens to be pretty  so much the

better  



 oh  that s all right  count  otherwise i should despair of you  



 and now that you have found me  madame  will you deign to inform me   



 oh  it is simply that i am indulging in some beautiful dreams for you  

the duchess interposed   where i would like to see you  d orbec  do you

know  is in poyet s place  for i detest him   she added  with a

malevolent glance at the chancellor  who was still walking with the

constable 



 what  madame  one of the most exalted posts in the realm  



 well  are you not yourself an eminent man  count  but alas  my power is

so precarious  my throne is upon the brink of an abyss  even at this

moment i am in mortal terror  the king has for a mistress the wife of a

nobody  a petty judge named féron  if the woman were ambitious we

should be ruined  i ought to have taken the initiative myself in this

whim of his majesty s  ah  i shall never find another like the little

duchesse de brissac  whom i presented to him  a sweet woman of no force

of character  a mere child  i shall always weep for her  she was not

dangerous  and talked to the king of nothing but my perfections  poor

marie  she assumed all the burdens of my position  and left me all the

benefits  but this féronnière  as they call her  why  it requires all

my power to draw françois i  away from her  i have exhausted my whole

arsenal of seductions  and am driven  alas  to my last intrenchment 

habit  



 how so  madame  



 mon dieu  yes  i devote myself almost exclusively to his mind now  for

his heart is elsewhere  you can understand how much i need an auxiliary 

where can i find her   a devoted  sincere friend  of whom i can be sure 

ah  i would repay her with such quantities of gold and such a host of

honors  seek out such a one for me  d orbec  you know how closely the

king and the man are allied in the person of our sovereign  and to what

lengths the man can lead the king on  if we could be  not rivals but

allies  not mistresses but friends  if  while one held sway over

françois  the other might hold sway over françois i   france would be

ours  count  and at what a moment  just as charles v  is about to plunge

into our net of his own free will  when we can hold him to ransom on

such terms as we choose  and take advantage of his imprudence to assure

ourselves a magnificent future in case of accident  i will explain my

plans to you  d orbec  this diane who pleases you so much would no

longer threaten our fortunes  and the chevalier de france might

become  but here is the king  



such was the way of madame d etampes  she rarely explained her meaning 

but left it to be guessed  she would sow ideas in a man s mind  and set

avarice  ambition  and natural perversity at work  and then she would

conveniently interrupt herself  a great and useful art  which cannot be

too highly commended to many poets and innumerable lovers 



so it was that comte d orbec  eager in the pursuit of gain and honors 

corrupt to the last degree and worn out by years and dissipation 

perfectly understood the duchess  whose eyes more than once during the

interview had wandered toward colombe 



ascanio s noble and straightforward nature was quite incapable of

sounding the depths of this mystery of iniquity and infamy  but he had a

vague foreboding that this strange and ominous conversation concealed

some terrible peril for his beloved  and he gazed at madame d etampes in

terror 



an usher announced the king and queen  in an instant everybody was

standing  hat in hand 



 god have you in his keeping  messieurs   said françois as he entered

the room   i have some weighty news which i must make known to you at

once  our dear brother  the emperor charles v   is at this moment  en

route  for france  if he has not already passed the frontier  let us

prepare  messieurs  to welcome him worthily  i need not remind my loyal

nobility of the obligations imposed upon us by the laws of hospitality

at such a time  we proved at the field of the cloth of gold  that we

knew how kings should be received  within the month charles v   will be

at the louvre  



 and i  my lords   said queen eleanora in her sweet voice   thank you in

advance in my royal brother s name for the welcome you will accord him  



the nobles replied with shouts of  vive le roi  vive la reine  vive

l empereur  



at that moment something wriggled its way along between the legs of the

courtiers toward the king  it was triboulet 



 sire   said the fool   will you permit me to dedicate to your majesty a

work i am about to print  



 with all the pleasure in the world  fool   the king replied   but i

must first know the title of the work  and how far advanced it is  



 sire  the work will be entitled the  almanac of fools   and will

contain a list of the greatest idiots that the world has ever seen  as

to the progress i have made with it  i have already inscribed upon the

first page the name of the king of all fools past and to come  



 who might this illustrious worthy be  whom you give me for cousin  and

select for king of fools  



 charles v   sire  



 charles v    cried the king   and why charles v   



 because there is no other than charles v  in the world  who  after

detaining you a prisoner at madrid as he did  would be insane enough to

pass through your majesty s dominions  



 but suppose that he does pass through the very heart of my dominions

without accident  



 in that case   said triboulet   i promise to erase his name and put

another in its place  



 whose name will that be   queried the king 



 yours  sire  for in allowing him to pass you will show yourself a

greater fool than he  



the king roared with laughter  the courtiers echoed his merriment  poor

eleanora alone turned pale 



 very good   said françois   put my name in place of the emperor s at

once  for i have given my word of honor  and i ll stand to it  as to the

dedication  i accept it  and here is the price of the first copy that

appears  



with that the king tossed a well filled purse to triboulet  who caught

it in his teeth  and hopped away on all fours  growling like a dog with

a bone 



 madame   said the provost of paris to the queen  as he stepped forward

with colombe   will your majesty permit me to avail myself of this

joyful moment to present to you under happy auspices my daughter

colombe  whom you have condescended to receive as one of your maids of

honor  



the kindly queen addressed a few words of congratulation and

encouragement to poor abashed colombe  at whom the king meanwhile was

gazing in admiration 



 by my halidome  messire le prévôt   said françois  smiling   do you

know that it s nothing less than high treason to have kept such a pearl

so long buried and out of sight   a pearl so well adapted to shine in

the garland of beauties who surround the majesty of our queen  if you

are not punished  for the felony  messire robert  you may thank the mute

intercession of those lovely downcast eyes  



thereupon the king  with a graceful salutation to the charming girl 

passed on to the chapel followed by the whole court 



 madame   said the duke of medina sidonia  offering his hand to the

duchesse d etampes   shall we not allow the throng to pass  and remain a

little behind  we shall be more conveniently situated here than

elsewhere for a word or two of importance which i have to say to you in

private  



 i am at your service  monsieur l ambassadeur   replied the duchess   do

not go  comte d orbec  you may say anything  monsieur de medina  before

this old friend  who is my second self  and this young man  who speaks

nothing but italian  



 their discretion is of no less consequence to you than to me  madame 

and if you feel sure of them  but we are alone  and i will go straight

to the point without digression or concealment  you understand that his

sacred majesty has determined to pass through france   that he is in all

probability already within her boundaries  he is well aware  however 

that his path lies between two long lines of enemies  but he relies upon

the chivalrous loyalty of the king  you have yourself advised him so to

rely  madame  and i frankly admit that  having vastly more power than

any titular minister  you have enough influence over françois to set a

trap for the emperor  or guarantee his safety  according as your advice

is friendly or unfriendly  but why should you turn against us  it is

neither for the state s interest nor your own to do so  



 go on  monseigneur  you have not said all that you have to say  i

fancy  



 no  madame  charles v  is a worthy successor of charlemagne  and what a

disloyal ally might demand from him as ransom he proposes to bestow as a

gift  and to leave neither hospitality nor friendly counsel unrewarded  



 superb  he will act with no less discretion than grandeur  



 king françois i  has always ardently desired the duchy of milan 

madame  and charles will consent to cede that province  a never ending

subject of contention between france and spain  in consideration of an

annual rent charge  



 i understand   said the duchess   the emperor s finances are in a

straitened condition  as everybody knows  on the other hand  the

milanese is ruined by a score of wars  and his sacred majesty would not

be sorry to transfer his claim from a poor to an opulent debtor  i

refuse  monsieur de medina  you must yourself understand that such a

proposition could not be acceptable  



 but  madame  overtures have already been made to his majesty on the

subject of this investiture  and he seemed delighted with the idea  



 i know it  but i refuse  if you can dispense with my consent  so much

the better for you  



 madame  the emperor is especially desirous to know that you are in his

interest  and whatever you may desire   



 my influence is not merchandise to be bought and sold  monsieur

l ambassadeur  



 o madame  who implied such a thing  



 hark ye  you assure me that your master desires my support  and between

ourselves he is wise  very well  to promise it to him i demand less than

he offers  follow me closely  this is what he must do  he must promise

françois i  the investiture of the duchy of milan  but as soon as he

has left france behind  he must remember the violated treaty of madrid 

and forget his promise  



 why  that would mean war  madame  



 stay a moment  monsieur de medina  his majesty will cry out and

threaten  no doubt  thereupon charles will consent to make the milanese

an independent state  and will give it  free of all tribute  to charles

d orléans  the king s second son  in that way the emperor will not

aggrandize a rival  that will be worth a few crowns to him  monseigneur 

and i think that you can have nothing to say against it  as to any

personal desires i may have  as you suggested a moment since  if his

sacred majesty enters into my plans  he may let fall in my presence  at

our first interview  a bauble of more or less brilliancy  which i will

pick up  if it is worth the trouble  and retain as a souvenir of the

glorious alliance concluded between the successor of the cæsars  king

of spain and the indies  and myself  



the duchess turned to ascanio  who was as terrified by her dark and

mysterious schemes as the duke of medina was disturbed by them  and as

comte d orbec seemed delighted 



 all this for you  ascanio   she whispered   to win your heart i would

sacrifice france  well  monsieur l ambassadeur   she continued aloud 

 what have you to say to that  



 the emperor alone can decide upon a matter of such gravity  madame 

nevertheless  everything leads me to believe that he will acquiesce in

an arrangement which almost terrifies me  it seems so favorable to us  



 if it will set your mind at rest  i will say to you that it is in

reality equally favorable to me  and that is why i undertake to make the

king accept it  we women have our own political schemes  more profound

sometimes than yours  but i can promise you that mine are in no wise

inimical to your interests  indeed  how could they be  meanwhile 

however  pending the decision of charles v   you may be sure that i

shall not lose an opportunity to act against him  and that i shall do my

utmost to induce his majesty to detain him as a prisoner  



 what  madame  is this your way of beginning an alliance  



 go to  monsieur l ambassadeur  can a statesman like yourself fail to

see that the most essential thing for me is to put aside all suspicion

of undue influence  and that to espouse your cause openly would be the

surest method of ruining it  moreover  i do not propose that any one

shall ever be able to betray me or denounce me  let me be your enemy 

monsieur le duc  and let me talk against you  what does it matter to

you  do you not know what mere words amount to  if charles v  refuses to

accept my terms i will say to the king   sire  trust to my generous

womanly instinct  you must not recoil before just and necessary

reprisals   and if the emperor accepts  i will say   sire  trust to my

feminine  that is to say  feline sharpness  you must resign yourself to

commit an infamous but advantageous act  



 ah  madame   said the duke of medina  bowing low   what a pity it is

that you should be a queen  you would have made such a perfect

ambassador  



with that the duke took leave of madame d etampes  and walked away 

enchanted with the unexpected turn the negotiations had taken 



 now it is my purpose to speak plainly and without circumlocution   said

the duchess to comte d orbec  when she was alone with ascanio and him 

 you know three things  count  first  that it is most important for my

friends and myself that my power should at this moment be put beyond

question and beyond the reach of attack  secondly  that when this

arrangement is once carried through  we shall have no occasion to dread

the future  that charles d orléans will fill the place of françois i  

and that the duke of milan  whom i shall have made what he is  will owe

me much more gratitude than the king of france  who has made me what i

am  thirdly  that your colombe s beauty has made a vivid impression upon

his majesty  very well  i address myself now  count  to the superior

individual  who is not influenced by vulgar prejudices  you hold your

fate in your own hands at this moment  do you choose that trésorier

d orbec should succeed chancelier poyet  or  in more positive terms 

that colombe d orbec should succeed marie de brissac  



ascanio in his horror made a movement which d orbec did not notice  as

he met the searching gaze of madame d etampes with a villanous leer 



 i desire to be chancellor   he replied briefly 



 good  then we are both saved  but what of the provost  



 oh   said the count   you can find some fat office for him  only let it

be lucrative rather than honorable  i beg  it will all fall to me when

the gouty old rascal dies  



ascanio could contain himself no longer 



 madame   he exclaimed in a voice of thunder  stepping forward 



he had no time to say more  the count had no time to be astonished  for

the folding doors were thrown open and the whole court flocked in 



madame d etampes roughly seized ascanio s hand  and drew him aside with

her  as she said in his ear  in a suppressed voice  trembling with

passion   



 now do you see  young man  how one becomes a king s plaything  and

whither life sometimes leads us  in our own despite  



she said no more  her words were interrupted by the uproarious good

humor and witty sallies of the king and courtiers 



françois i  was radiant  for charles v  was coming  there would be

receptions  fêtes  surprises   a glorious part for him to play  the

whole world would have its eyes fixed upon paris and its king  he looked

forward with childish joy to the performance of the drama of which he

held all the threads  it was his nature to look at everything on the

brilliant rather than on the serious side  to aim more at effect than

anything else  and to look upon battles as tournaments  and upon royalty

as an art  with a mind well stored with strange  poetic  adventurous

ideas  françois i  made of his reign a theatrical performance  with the

world for play house 



on this day  as he was on the eve of dazzling a rival and europe  his

clemency and benignity were more charming than ever 



as if reassured by his smiling face  triboulet rolled up to him just as

he passed through the door 



 o sire  sire   cried the fool dolefully   i come to take my leave of

you  your majesty must make up your mind to lose me  and i weep for you

more than for myself  what will become of your majesty without poor

triboulet  whom you love so dearly  



 what  you are going to leave me  fool  at this moment when there is but

one fool for two kings  



 yes  sire  at this moment  when there are two kings for one fool  



 but i do not propose to have it so  triboulet  i order you to remain  



 in that case pray see that monsieur de vieilleville is informed of your

royal pleasure  for i but told him what people say of his wife  and for

so simple a matter he swore that he would cut off my ears in the first

place  and then tear out my soul  if i had one  added the impious

villain  whose tongue your majesty should order to be cut out for such

blasphemy  



 la  la   rejoined the king   have no fear  my poor fool  the man who

should take your life would be very sure to be hanged a quarter of an

hour after  



 o sire  if it makes no difference to you   



 well  what  



 have him hanged a quarter of an hour before  i much prefer that  



the whole assemblage roared with laughter  the king above all the

others  as he walked on he passed pietro strozzi  the noble florentine

exile 



 signor pietro strozzi   he said   it is a long time  altogether too

long  i confess  since you requested letters of naturalization at our

hands  it is a disgrace to us that  after having fought so valiantly in

piedmont for the french and like a true frenchman  you do not yet belong

to us  since your country by birth denies you  this evening  signor

pietro  messire le maçon  my secretary  will take steps to hasten the

issuance of your letters of naturalization  do not thank me  for my

honor and your own charles v  must find you a frenchman   ah  there you

are  cellini  and you never come empty handed  what have you under your

arm  my friend  but stay a moment  it shall not be said  i  faith  that

i did not surpass you in munificence  messire antoine le maçon  you

will see that letters of naturalization are issued to my good friend

benvenuto at the same time with the great pietro strozzi s  and you will

issue them without expense to him  a goldsmith cannot put his hand upon

five hundred ducats so readily as a strozzi  



 sire   said benvenuto   i thank your majesty  but i pray you to forgive

my ignorance  what are these letters of naturalization  



 what   exclaimed antoine le maçon  with great gravity  while the king

laughed like a madman at the question   do you not know  master

benvenuto  that letters of naturalization are the greatest honor his

majesty can bestow upon a foreigner   that you thereby become a

frenchman  



 i begin to understand  sire  and i thank you again   said cellini   but

pardon me  as i am already at heart your majesty s subject  of what use

are these letters  



 of what use are the letters   rejoined françois  still in the best of

humor   why they are of this use  benvenuto  that now that you are a

frenchman  i can make you seigneur du grand nesle  which was not

possible before  messire le maçon  you will add to the letters of

naturalization the definitive deed of the château  do you understand

now  benvenuto  of what use the letters of naturalization are  



 yes  sire  and i thank you a thousand times  one would say that our

hearts understood each other without words  for this favor which you

bestow upon me to day is a step toward a very  very great favor which i

shall perhaps dare to ask at your hands some day  and is  so to say  a

part of it  



 you know what i promised you  benvenuto  bring me my jupiter  and ask

what you will  



 yes  your majesty has a good memory  and i hope your word will prove to

be as good  yes  your majesty  you have it in your power to gratify a

wish  upon which my life in a measure depends  and you have already  by

a sublime instinct worthy of a king  made its gratification more easy  



 it shall be done  my eminent artist  according to your wish  but 

meanwhile  allow us to see what you have in your hands  



 it is a silver salt dish  sire  to go with the ewer and the basin  



 show it me quickly  benvenuto  



the king scrutinized  carefully and silently as always  the marvellous

piece of work which cellini handed him 



 what a blunder   he said at last   what a paradox  



 what  sire   cried benvenuto  disappointed beyond measure   your

majesty is not pleased with it  



 certainly not  monsieur  why  you spoil a lovely idea by executing it

in silver  it must be done in gold  cellini  i am very sorry for you 

but you must begin again  



 alas  sire   said benvenuto sadly   be not so ambitious for my poor

works  the richness of the material will destroy these treasures of my

thought  i greatly fear  more lasting glory is to be attained by working

in clay than in gold  sire  and the names of us goldsmiths survive us

but a little while  necessity is sometimes a cruel master  sire  and men

are always greedy and stupid  who can say that a silver cup for which

your majesty would give ten thousand ducats  might not be melted down

for ten crowns  



 how now  do you think that the king of france will ever pawn the dishes

from his table  



 sire  the emperor of constantinople pawned our saviour s crown of

thorns with the venetians  



 but a king of france took it out of pawn  monsieur  



 very true  but think of the possible risks  revolution and exile  i

come from a country whence the medicis have been thrice expelled and

thrice recalled  and it is only kings like your majesty  who are

glorious in themselves  from whom their treasures cannot be taken away  



 no matter  benvenuto  no matter  i desire my salt dish in gold  and my

treasurer will hand you to day a thousand gold crowns of the old weight

for that purpose  you hear  comte d orbec  to day  for i do not wish

cellini to lose a minute  adieu  benvenuto  go on with your work  the

king does not forget his jupiter  adieu  messieurs  think of charles v  



while françois was descending the staircase to join the queen  who was

already in her carriage  and whom he was to accompany on horseback 

divers incidents occurred which we must not omit to mention 



benvenuto walked up to comte d orbec and said to him   be good enough to

have the gold ready for me  messire le trésorier  in obedience to his

majesty s commands i go at once to my house for a bag  and shall be at

your office in a half hour   the count bowed in token of acquiescence 

and cellini took his departure alone  after looking around in vain for

ascanio 



at the same time marmagne was speaking in an undertone with the provost 

who still held colombo s hand 



 this is a magnificent opportunity   he said   and i shall go at once

and summon my men  do you tell d orbec to detain cellini as long as

possible  



with that he disappeared  and messire d estourville went to d orbec and

whispered a few words in his ear  after which he said aloud   



 meanwhile  count  i will take colombe back to the hôtel de nesle  



 very good   said d orbec   and come and let me know the result this

evening  



they separated  and the provost slowly walked away with his daughter

toward the hôtel de nesle  followed without their knowledge by ascanio 

who did not lose sight of them  but kept his eyes fixed fondly upon his

colombe 



meanwhile the king was mounting a superb sorrel  his favorite steed 

presented to him by henry viii 



 we are to make a long journey together to day   he said 





  gentil  joli petit cheval 

bon à monter  doux à descendre   11 





faith  there are the first two lines of a quatrain   he added   cap them

for me  marot  or you  master melin de saint gelais  



marot scratched his head  but saint gelais anticipated him  and with

extraordinary promptness and success continued   





 sans que tu sois un bucéphal 

tu portes plus grand qu alexandre   12 





he was applauded on all sides  and the king  already in the saddle 

waved his hand gracefully in acknowledgment of the poet s swift and

happy inspiration 



marot returned to the apartments of the queen of navarre  more out of

sorts than ever 



 i don t know what the matter was with them at court to day   he

grumbled   but they were all extremely stupid  





 footnote 8  it was at villers cotterets  a small town in the department of

aisne  where françois i  had a château  that the famous ordinance

was signed  providing that the acts of sovereign courts should no

longer be written in latin  but should be drawn up in the vernacular 

this château is still in existence  although sadly shorn of its

pristine magnificence  and diverted from the uses for which it was

originally intended  begun by françois i   who carved the salamanders

upon it  it was finished by henri ii   who added his cipher

and that of catherine de medicis  the visitor may still see those

two letters  masterpieces of the renaissance  connected   and note

this well  for the spirit of the time is epitomized in this lapidary

fact   connected by a lover s knot  which includes also the crescent

of diane de poitiers  a charming  but  we must agree  a strange

trilogy  which consists of the cipher and arms of the husband  the

wife  and the mistress

four varieties of brigands





benvenuto crossed the seine in all haste  and procured  not a bag as he

had told comte d orbec that he should  but a small wicker basket given

him by one of his cousins  a nun at florence  as he was determined to

make an end of the affair that day  and it was already two o clock  he

did not wait for ascanio  whom he had completely lost sight of  nor his

workmen  who had gone to dinner  but started at once for rue

froid manteau  where comte d orbec had his official residence  and

although he kept his eyes open he saw nothing on the way to cause him

the least uneasiness 



when he reached the treasurer s abode that dignitary informed him that

he could not deliver his gold to him at once  as there were certain

indispensable formalities to be gone through with  a notary to be

summoned  and a contract to be drawn up  the count apologized with a

thousand expressions of regret  knowing cellini s impatient nature  and

was so courteous withal that it was impossible to be angry  and

benvenuto resigned himself to wait  believing in the reality of these

obstacles to a speedy delivery of the gold 



cellini desired to take advantage of the delay to send for some of his

workmen  that they might accompany him home  and help him to carry the

gold  d orbec quickly volunteered to send one of his servants to the

hôtel de nesle with the message  then he led the conversation around to

cellini s work  and the king s evident partiality for him   to anything

in short likely to incline benvenuto to be patient   which was the less

difficult of accomplishment as he had no reason for wishing ill to the

count  and no suspicion that the count had any reason for being hostile

to him  there was his desire to supplant him with colombe  but no one

knew of that desire save ascanio and himself  he therefore met the

treasurer s friendly overtures graciously enough 



further time was necessary to select gold of the degree of fineness

which the king desired him to have  the notary was very slow in coming 

a contract is not drawn up in a moment  in short  when  after the final

exchange of courtesies  benvenuto made ready to return to his studio 

night was beginning to fall  he questioned the servant who was sent for

his companions  and was told that they were unable to come  but that he

would gladly carry the gold for him  benvenuto s suspicions were

aroused  and he declined the offer  courteous as it was 



he placed the gold in his little basket  then passed his arm through the

two handles  and as there was barely room for his arm  the cover was

securely pressed down  and he carried it much more easily than if it had

been in a bag  he had a stout coat of mail with sleeves beneath his

coat  a short sword at his side  and a dagger in his belt  he set out on

his homeward journey at a quick pace  but cautiously nevertheless  just

before he started he noticed several servants speaking together in low

tones  and that they left the house in a great hurry  but they made a

show of going in a different direction from that taken by him 



to day  when one can go from the louvre to the institute by the pont des

arts  benvenuto s homeward journey would be but a stride  but at that

time it was a long walk  he was obliged  starting from rue

froid manteau  to follow the quay as far as the châtelet  cross the

pont des meuniers  go across the city by rue saint barthélemy  cross to

the left bank by the pont saint michel  and from there go down the river

to the grand nesle by the deserted quay  the reader need not wonder

that  in those days of thieves and cut throats  benvenuto 

notwithstanding his courage  felt some anxiety touching so considerable

a sum as that he carried upon his arm  and if he will go forward with us

two or three hundred yards in advance of benvenuto he will see that his

anxiety was not unjustifiable 



when it began to grow dark  about an hour before  four men of forbidding

appearance  wrapped in great cloaks  stationed themselves upon the quai

des augustins  at a point abreast of the church  the river bank was

bordered with walls only at that spot  and was absolutely deserted at

that moment  while they stood there they saw no one pass but the

provost  on his way back to the châtelet after escorting colombe to the

petit nesle  and him they saluted with the respect due the constituted

authorities 



they were talking in low tones in a recess formed by the church  and

their hats were pulled well down over their eyes  two of them are

already known to us  the bravos employed by vicomte de marmagne in his

ill fated expedition against the grand nesle  their names were ferrante

and fracasso  their companions  who earned their livelihood at the same

honorable calling  were named procope and maledent  in order that

posterity may not quarrel over the nationality of these four valiant

captains  as it has done for three thousand years over that of old

homer  we will add that maledent was a picard  procope a bohemian  and

that ferrante and fracasso first saw the light beneath the soft skies of

italy  as to their distinctive callings in time of peace  procope was a

jurist  ferrante a pedant  fracasso a dreamer of dreams  and maledent a

fool  it will be seen that the fact that we are ourselves a frenchman

does not blind us to the character of the only one of these four toilers

who happened to be our compatriot 



in battle all four were demons 



let us listen for a moment to their friendly and edifying conversation 

we may be able to judge therefrom what manner of men they were  and what

danger was impending over our good friend  benvenuto 



 at all events  fracasso   said ferrante   we shan t be hampered to day

with that great red faced viscount  and our poor swords can leave their

scabbards without his crying   retreat    the coward   and forcing us to

turn tail  



 very true   rejoined fracasso   but as he leaves us all the risk of the

combat  for which i thank him  he ought to leave us all the profit too 

by what right does the red haired devil reserve five hundred crowns for

his own part  i admit that the five hundred that remain make a very

pretty prize  a hundred and twenty five for each of us does us

honor   indeed  when times are hard  i sometimes find it necessary to

kill a man for two crowns  



 for two crowns  holy virgin   cried maledent   shame  that brings

discredit on the profession  don t say such things when i am with you 

for any one who overheard you might confound us with each other  my dear

fellow  



 what would you have  maledent   said fracasso  in a melancholy tone 

 life has its crosses  and there are times when one would kill a man for

a bit of bread  it seems to me  my good friends  that two hundred and

fifty crowns are worth just twice as much as a hundred and twenty five 

suppose that after we have killed our man we refuse to settle with that

great thief of a marmagne  



 you forget  brother   rejoined procope seriously   that would be

to disregard our agreement  to defraud our patron  and we must be loyal

in everything  let us hand the viscount the five hundred crowns to the

last sou  as agreed  that is my advice  but  distinguamus   let us make

a distinction  when he has pocketed them  and when he realizes that we

are honorable men  i fail to see why we shouldn t fall upon him and take

them from him  



 well thought of   exclaimed ferrante in a judicial tone   procope was

always distinguished for uprightness of character conjoined with a vivid

imagination  



 mon dieu  that is because i have studied law a little   said procope

modestly 



 but   continued ferrante  with the air of pedantry which was habitual

to him   let us not involve ourselves in too many plans at once   secte

ad terminum eamus   let the viscount sleep in peace  his turn will come 

this florentine goldsmith is the one we have to deal with at the moment 

for greater security  it was desired that four of us should set upon

him  strictly speaking one only should have done the deed and pocketed

the price  but the concentration of capital is a social plague  and  t

is much better that the money be divided among several friends  let us

despatch him swiftly and cleanly  he is no ordinary man  as fracasso and

i have learned  let us resign ourselves  therefore  for greater

security  to attack him all four at once  it cannot be long now before

he comes  attention  be cool  quick of foot and eye  and beware of the

italian thrusts he ll be sure to try on you  



 i know what it is  ferrante   said maledent disdainfully   to receive a

sword cut  whether with the edge or the point  once on a time i made my

way at night into a certain château in the bourbonnais on business of a

personal nature  being surprised by the dawn before i had fully

completed it  i had no choice but to conceal myself until the following

night  no place seemed to me so appropriate for that purpose as the

arsenal of the château  there were quantities of stands of arms and

trophies there  and helmets  cuirasses  armlets and cuisses  shields and

targets  i removed the upright upon which one of the suits of armor

hung  put myself in its place  and stood there  motionless upon my

pedestal  with lowered visor  



 this is very interesting   interposed ferrante   go on  maledent  how

can we better employ this period of waiting to perform one exploit  than

in listening to tales of other feats of arms  go on  



 i did not know   continued maledent   that accursed suit of armor was

used by the young men of the family to practise fencing upon  but soon

two strapping fellows of twenty came in  took down a lance and a sword

each  and began to cut and thrust at my casing with all their heart 

well  my friends  you may believe me or not  but under all their blows

with lance and sword  i never flinched  i stood there as straight and

immovable as if i had really been of wood  and riveted to my base 

fortunately the young rascals were not of the first force  the father

arrived in due time and urged them to aim at the joints in my armor  but

saint maledent  my patron  whom i invoked in a whisper  turned their

blows aside  at last that devil of a father  in order to show the

youngsters how to carry away a visor  took a lance himself  and at the

first blow uncovered my pale and terrified face  i thought i was lost  



 poor fellow   said fracasso sadly   how could it be otherwise  



 fancy  if you please  that when they saw my colorless face they took me

for the ghost of their great grandfather  and father and sons scuttled

away as if the devil was at their heels  need i say more  i turned my

back  and did as much for my own part  and you see i came out of it with

a whole skin  



 very good  but the important thing in our trade  friend maledent   said

procope   is not only to receive blows manfully  but to deal them

handsomely  it s a fine thing when the victim falls without a sound  in

one of my expeditions in flanders i had to rid one of my customers of

four of his intimate friends  who were travelling in company  he

proposed at first that i should take three comrades  but i told him that

i would undertake it alone  or not at all  it was agreed that i should

do as i chose  and that i should have the stipend four times over

provided that i delivered four dead bodies  i knew the road they were to

take  and i awaited their coming at an inn which they must of necessity

pass 



 the inn keeper had formerly belonged to the fraternity  and had left it

for his present occupation  which allowed him to plunder travellers

without risk  but he retained some kindly sentiments for his former

brethren  so that i had no great difficulty in winning him over to my

interest in consideration of a tenth of the reward  with that

understanding we awaited our four horsemen  who soon appeared around a

bend in the road  and alighted in front of the inn  preparatory to

filling their stomachs and resting their horses  the landlord said to

them that his stable was so small that  unless they went in one at a

time  they could hardly move there  and would be in each other s way 

the first who entered was so slow about coming out  that the second lost

patience and went to see what he was doing  he also was in no hurry to

reappear  whereupon the third  weary of waiting  followed the other two 

after some little time  as the fourth was expressing his astonishment at

their delay  mine host remarked   ah  i see what it is  the stable is so

extremely small  that they have gone out through the door at the rear  



 this explanation encouraged my last man to join his companions and

myself  for you will have guessed that i was in the stable  i allowed

him  however  the satisfaction of uttering one little cry  to say

farewell to the world  as there was no longer any danger 



 in roman law  ferrante  would not that he called  trucidatio per

divisionem necis   but  deuce take it   added procope  changing his

tone   our man doesn t come  god grant that nothing has happened to him 

it will he pitch dark very soon  



  suadentque cadentia sidera somnos    added fracasso   and by the way 

my friends  take care that benvenuto doesn t in the dark resort to a

trick which i once put in practice myself  it was during my sojourn on

the banks of the rhine  i always loved the banks of the rhine  the

country there is so picturesque and at the same time so melancholy  the

rhine is the river of dreamers  i was dreaming then upon the banks of

the rhine  and this was the subject of my dreams 



 a nobleman named schreckenstein  if my memory serves me  was to be put

to death  it was no easy matter  for he never went out without a strong

escort  this is the plan upon which i finally resolved 



 i donned a costume like that worn by him  and one dark evening i lay in

wait for him and his escort  when i saw them coming through the solitude

and darkness   obscuri sub nocte   i made a desperate attack upon

schreckenstein  who was walking a little ahead  but i was clever enough

to strike off his hat with its waving plumes  and then to change my

position so that i was standing where he should have been  thereupon i

stunned him with a violent blow with my sword hilt  and began to shout

amid the clashing of swords and the shouts of the others   help  help 

death to the brigands   so that schreckenstein s men fell furiously upon

their master and left him dead upon the spot  while i glided away into

the bushes  the worthy nobleman could at least say that he was killed by

his friends  



 it was a bold stroke   said ferrante   but if i were to cast a backward

glance upon my vanished past i could find a still more audacious exploit

there  like you  fracasso  i had to deal with a chief of partisans 

always well mounted and escorted  it was in a forest in the abruzzi  i

stationed myself in an enormous oak tree upon a great branch which

stretched out over the road at a point which the personage in question

must pass  and there i waited  musing  the sun was rising and its first

rays fell in long shafts of pale light down through the moss grown

branches  the morning air was fresh and keen  enlivened by the songs of

birds  suddenly   



 sh   procope interrupted him   i hear footsteps  attention  it s our

man  



 good   muttered maledent  glancing furtively about   all is silent and

deserted hereabout  fortune is on our side  



they stood without speaking or moving  their dark  threatening faces

could not be distinguished in the gathering gloom  but one might have

seen their gleaming eyes  their hands playing nervously with their

rapiers  and their attitude of breathless suspense  in the half darkness

they formed a striking dramatic group  which no pencil but salvator

rosa s could adequately reproduce 



it was in fact benvenuto coming on at a rapid pace  as we have said  his

suspicions were aroused  and with his piercing glance he maintained a

constant watch in the darkness  as his eyes were accustomed to the

uncertain light he saw the four bandits issue from their ambush when he

was still twenty yards away  and had time to throw his cloak over his

basket  and draw his sword  before they were upon him  furthermore  with

the self possession which never abandoned him  he backed against the

church wall  and thus faced all of his assailants 



they attacked him savagely  he could not retreat  and it was useless to

cry out as the château was five hundred yards away  but benvenuto was

no novice in deeds of arms  and he received the cut throats with vigor 



his mind remained perfectly clear  and a sudden thought flashed through

it as he plied his sword  it was evident that this ambuscade was

directed against him  and no other  if therefore he could succeed in

throwing them off the track  he was saved  he began therefore  as the

blows rained down upon him  to joke them upon their pretended mistake 



 what fit has seized you  my fine fellows  are you mad  what do you

expect to make out of an old soldier like me  is it my cloak that you

want  does my sword tempt you  stay  stay  you  if you want my good

sword  you must earn it  sang dieu  by my soul  for thieves who seem to

have served their apprenticeship  your scent is bad  my children  



with that he charged upon them  instead of falling back before them  but

only took one or two steps away from the wall  and immediately placed

his back against it once more  incessantly slashing and thrusting 

taking pains to throw aside his cloak several times  so that  if they

had been warned by comte d orbec s servants  whom he had seen leave the

house  and who had seen him count the money  they would at least

conclude that he had not the gold upon him  indeed  his assured manner

of speaking  and the ease with which he handled his sword with a

thousand crowns under his arm  caused the bravos to entertain some

doubts 



 damnation  do you suppose we have made a mistake  ferrante   said

fracasso 



 i fear so  the man seemed not so tall to me  or even if it is he  he

hasn t the gold  and that damned viscount deceived us  



 i have gold   cried benvenuto  thrusting and parrying vigorously all

the while   i have no gold save a handful of gilded copper  but if you

are ambitious to secure that  my children  you will pay dearer for it

than if it were gold belonging to another  i promise you  



 deuce take him   said procope   he s really a soldier  could any

goldsmith fence so cleverly as he  expend all your wind on him  if you

choose  you fellows  i don t light for glory  



and procope began to heat a retreat  grumbling to himself  while the

attack of the others relaxed in vigor  by reason of their doubts  as

well as of his absence  benvenuto  with no such motive for weakening 

seized the opportunity to drive them back  and to start for the

château  backing before his assailants  but fighting all the time  and

defending himself manfully  the savage boar was luring the hounds with

him to his den 



 come  my brave fellows  come with me   he said  bear me company as far

as the entrance to the pré aux clercs  the maison rouge  where my

sweetheart  whose father sells wine  is expecting me to night  the road

isn t very safe  so they say  and i should be glad to have an escort  



upon that pleasantry  fracasso also abandoned the chase  and went to

join procope 



 we are fools  ferrante   said maledent   this isn t your benvenuto  



 yes  yes  i say it is himself   cried ferrante  who had at last

discovered the basket bulging out with money under benvenuto s arm  as a

too sudden movement disarranged his cloak 



but it was too late  the château was within a hundred feet or less  and

benvenuto was shouting in his powerful voice   hôtel de nesle  ho 

help  help  



fracasso had barely time to retrace his steps  procope to hasten up  and

ferrante and maledent to redouble their efforts  the workmen who were

expecting their master  were on the alert  the door of the château was

flung open at his first shout  and hermann the colossus  little jehan 

simon le gaucher  and jacques aubry came running out armed with pikes 



at that sight the bravos turned and fled 



 wait  wait  my dear young friends   benvenuto shouted to the fugitives 

 won t you escort me a little farther  o the bunglers  who couldn t take

from one lone man a thousand golden crowns which tired his arm  



the brigands had in fact succeeded in inflicting no other injury than a

slight scratch upon their opponent s hand  and they made their escape

shamefaced  and fracasso howling with pain  poor fracasso at the very

last lost his right eye  and was one eyed for the rest of his days  a

circumstance which accentuated the tinge of melancholy which was the

most prominent characteristic of his pensive countenance 



 well  my children   said benvenuto to his companions  when the

footsteps of the bravos had died away in the distance   we must have

some supper after that exploit  come all and drink to my escape  my dear

rescuers  but god help inc  i do not see ascanio among you  where is

ascanio  



the reader will remember that ascanio left the louvre before his master 



 i know where he is   said little jehan 



 where is he  my boy   asked benvenuto 



 down at the end of the garden  where he has been walking for half an

hour  the student and i went there to talk with him  but he begged us to

leave him alone  



 strange   said benvenuto   how did he fail to hear my shout  how is it

that he did not hasten to me with the others  do not wait for me  but

sup without me  my children  ah  there you are  scozzone  



 o mon dieu  what is this they tell me   that some one tried to murder

you  master  



 yes  yes  there was something like that  



 mon dieu   cried scozzone 



 it was nothing  my dear girl  nothing   said benvenuto consolingly  for

poor catherine had become as pale as death   go now and bring wine  of

the best  for these gallant fellows  take the keys of the cellar from

dame ruperta  scozzone  and select it yourself  



 why  you are not going out again   said scozzone 



 no  never fear  i am going to find ascanio in the garden  i have

important matters to discuss with him  



scozzone and the others returned to the studio  and benvenuto walked

toward the gate leading to the garden 



the moon was just rising  and the master saw ascanio very plainly  but 

instead of walking  the young man was climbing a ladder set against the

wall between the gardens of the grand and petit nesle  when he reached

the top  he pulled the ladder up after him  lowered it on the other

side  and disappeared 



benvenuto passed his hand over his eyes like a man who cannot believe

what he sees  forming a sudden resolution  he went straight to the

foundry and up into his cell  stepped to the window sill  and leaped to

the wall of the petit nesle  from there  with the aid of a stout vine 

he dropped noiselessly into colombe s garden  it had rained in the

morning  and the ground was so damp that his footfalls were deadened 



he put his ear to the ground  and questioned the silence for some

moments  at last he heard subdued voices in the distance  which guided

his steps  he at once rose  and crept cautiously forward  feeling his

way  and stopping from moment to moment  soon the voices became more

distinct 



benvenuto walked toward them  and at last  when he reached the second

path which crossed the garden  he recognized colombe  or rather divined

her presence in the shadow  dressed in white  and sitting beside ascanio

on the bench we already know  they were talking in low tones  but

distinctly  and with animation 



hidden from their observation by a clump of trees  benvenuto drew near

and listened 









iii





an autumn night s dream





it was a beautiful autumn evening  calm and clear  the moon had driven

away almost all the clouds  and the few which remained were scattered

here and there over the star strewn sky  around the group talking and

listening in the garden of the petit nesle  everything was calm and

silent  but within their hearts all was sadness and agitation 



 my darling colombe   said ascanio  while benvenuto  standing cold and

pale behind him  seemed to be listening with his heart rather than with

his ears   my dearest love  why  alas  did our paths meet  when you know

all that i have to tell you of misery and horror  you will curse me for

being the bearer of such news  



 nay  my dear   replied colombe   whatever you may have to tell me  i

shall bless you  for in my eyes you are as one sent by god  i never

heard my mother s voice  but i feel that i should have listened to her

as i listen to you  go on  ascanio  and if you have terrible things to

tell me  your voice will at least comfort me a little  



 summon all your courage and all your strength   said ascanio 



thereupon he told her all that had taken place in his presence between

madame d etampes and comte d orbec  he described the whole plot  a

combination of treason against the kingdom and designs upon the honor of

an innocent child  he subjected himself to the agony of explaining the

infamous bargain made by the treasurer to that ingenuous soul  aghast at

this revelation of wickedness  he must needs to make the maiden  whose

heart was so pure that she did not blush at his words  understand the

cruel refinements of torture and ignominy which hatred and baffled love

suggested to the favorite  all that was perfectly clear to colombe s

mind was that her lover was filled with loathing and dismay  and  like

the slender vine which has no other support than the sapling to which it

clings  she trembled and shuddered with him 



 my dear   she said   you must make known this fearful plot against my

honor to my father  my father does not suspect our love  he owes you his

life  and he will listen to you  oh  never fear  he will rescue me from

the clutches of comte d orbec  



 alas   was ascanio s only reply 



 o my love   cried colombe  who understood all the apprehension

contained in her lover s exclamation   oh  can you suspect my father of

complicity in so hateful a design  that would be too wicked  ascanio 

no  my father knows nothing  suspects nothing  i am sure  and although

he has never shown me any great affection  he would never with his own

hand plunge me into shame and misery  



 forgive me  colombe   rejoined ascanio   but your father is not

accustomed to see misery in increased wealth  a title would conceal the

shame  and in his courtier like pride he would deem you happier as a

king s mistress than as an artist s wife  it is my duty to hide nothing

from you  colombe  comte d orbec told madame la duchesse d etampes that

he would answer for your father  



 just god  is it possible   cried the poor girl   was such a thing ever

seen  ascanio  as a father who sold his daughter  



 such things are seen in all countries and at all times  my poor angel 

and more than ever at this time and in this country  do not picture to

yourself the world as fashioned after the image of your heart  or

society as taking pattern by your virtue  yes  colombe  the noblest

names of france have shamelessly farmed out the youth and beauty of

their wives and daughters to the royal lust  it is looked upon as a

matter of course at court  and your father  if he cares to take the

trouble to justify himself  will not lack illustrious precedents  i beg

you to forgive me  my beloved  for bringing your chaste and spotless

soul so abruptly in contact with this hideous reality  but i cannot

avoid the necessity of showing you the snare that is laid for you  



 ascanio  ascanio   cried colombe  hiding her face against the young

man s shoulder   my father also turns against me  oh  simply to repeat

it kills me with shame  where can i fly for shelter  where but to your

arms  ascanio  yes  it is for you to save me now  have you spoken to

your master  to benvenuto  who is so strong and great and kindly 

judging by your description of him  and whom i love because you love

him  



 nay  do not love him  do not love him  colombe   cried ascanio 



 why not   whispered the girl 



 because he loves you  because  instead of the friend upon whom we

thought we could rely  he is one enemy the more we have to contend

against  an enemy  you understand  and the most formidable of all our

enemies  listen  



thereupon he told her how  as he was on the point of making a confidant

of benvenuto  the goldsmith described to him his ideal love  and added

that the favorite sculptor of françois i  by virtue of the king s word

of honor to which he had never proved false  could obtain whatever he

chose to ask after the statue of jupiter was cast  as we know  the boon

that benvenuto proposed to ask was colombe s hand 



 o god  we have none to look to for succor but thee   said colombe 

raising her white hands and her lovely eyes to heaven   all our friends

are changed to enemies  every haven of refuge becomes a dangerous reef 

are you certain that we are so utterly abandoned  



 only too certain   replied ascanio   my master is as dangerous to us as

your father  colombe  yes   he continued  wringing his hands   i am

almost driven to hate him  benvenuto  my friend  my master  my

protector  my father  my god  and yet i ask you  colombe  why i should

hear him ill will  because he has fallen under the spell to which every

exalted mind that comes in contact with yours must yield  because he

loves you as i love you  his crime is my own  after all  but you love

me  colombe  and so i am absolved  what shall we do  for two days i have

been asking myself the question  and i do not know whether i begin to

detest him  or whether i love him still  he loves you  it is true  but

he has loved me so dearly  too  that my poor heart wavers and trembles

in its perplexity like a reed shaken in the wind  what will he do  first

of all  i shall tell him of comte d orbec s designs  and i hope that he

will deliver us from them  but after that  when we find ourselves face

to face as enemies  when i tell him that his pupil is his rival 

colombe  his will  which is omnipotent as fate  will perhaps be as

blind  he will forget ascanio to think only of colombe  he will turn his

eyes away from the man he once loved  to see only the woman he loves 

for i feel myself that between him and you i should not hesitate  i feel

that i would remorselessly sacrifice my heart s past for its future 

earth for heaven  and why should he act differently  he is a man  and to

renounce his love would be more than human  we must therefore  fight it

out  but how can i  feeble and alone as i am  resist him  but no matter 

colombe  even if i should come some day to hate him i have loved so long

and so well  i tell you now that i would not for all the world subject

him to the torture he inflicted upon me the other morning when he

declared his love for you  



meanwhile benvenuto  standing like a statue behind his tree  felt the

drops of icy sweat roll down his forehead  and his hand clutched

convulsively at his heart 



 poor ascanio  dear heart   returned colombe   you have suffered

bitterly already  and have much to suffer still  but let us face the

future calmly  let us not exaggerate our griefs  for the prospect is not

altogether desperate  including god there are three of us to make head

against misfortune  you would rather see me benvenuto s wife than comte

d orbec s  would you not  but you would also prefer to see me wedded to

the lord than to benvenuto  very well  if i am not yours  i will belong

to none but the lord  be sure of that  ascanio  your wife in this world 

or your betrothed in the other  that is my promise to you  ascanio  and

that promise i will keep  never fear  



 thanks  thou angel from heaven  thanks   said ascanio   let us forget

the great world around us  and concentrate our lives upon this little

thicket where we now are  colombe  you haven t told me yet that you love

me  alas  it would almost seem that you are mine because you could not

do otherwise  



 hush  ascanio  hush  do you not see that i am trying to sanctify my

happiness by making it a duty  i love you  ascanio  i love you  



benvenuto could no longer find strength to stand  he fell upon his knees

with his head against a tree  his haggard eyes were fixed vacantly on

space  while  with his ear turned toward the young people  he listened

with feverish intentness 



 dear colombe   echoed ascanio   i love you  and something tells me that

we shall be happy  and that the lord will not abandon the loveliest of

all his angels  mon dieu  mon dieu  in this atmosphere of joy which

surrounds me  i forget the circle of grief which i must enter when i

leave you  



 we must think of to morrow   said colombe   let us help ourselves 

ascanio  so that god may help us  it would be disloyal  i think  to

leave your master benvenuto in ignorance of our love  for he would

perhaps incur great risk in contending against madame d etampes and

comte d orbec  it would not be fair  you must tell him everything 

ascanio  



 i will obey you  dearest colombe  for a word from you  as you must

know  is law to me  my heart also tells me that you are right  always

right  but it will be a terrible blow for him  alas  i judge from my own

heart  it is possible that his love for me may turn to hatred  it is

possible that he will turn me out of doors  in that case how can i  a

stranger  without friends or shelter  resist such powerful enemies as

the duchesse d etampes and the king s treasurer  who will help me to

defeat the plans of that terrible couple  who will fight on my side in

this unequal struggle  who will hold out a helping hand to me  



 i   said a deep  grave voice behind them 



 benvenuto   cried the apprentice  without even turning round 



colombe shrieked and sprang to her feet  ascanio gazed at his master 

wavering between affection and wrath 



 yes  it is i  benvenuto cellini   continued the goldsmith    i  whom

you do not love  mademoiselle   i  whom you no longer love  ascanio  and

who come to save you both  nevertheless  



 what do you say   cried ascanio 



 i say that you must come and sit down again  here by my side  for we

must understand one another  you have no need to tell me aught  i have

not lost a word of your conversation  forgive me for listening after i

came upon you by chance  but you understand  it is much better that i

should know all  you have said some things very sad and terrible for me

to hear  but some kind things too  ascanio was sometimes right and

sometimes wrong  it is very true  mademoiselle  that i would have

disputed you with him  but since you love him  that s the end of it  be

happy  he has forbidden you to love me  but i will force you to it by

giving you to him  



 dear master   cried ascanio 



 you suffer  monsieur  do you not   said colombe clasping her hands 



 ah  thanks  thanks   said benvenuto  as his eyes filled with tears  but

restraining his feelings with a mighty effort   you see that i suffer 

he would not have noticed it  ungrateful boy  but nothing escapes a

woman s eyes  yes  i will not tell you a falsehood  i do suffer  and why

not  since you are lost to me  but at the same time i am happy  because

i am able to serve you  you will owe everything to me  and that thought

comforts me a little  you were wrong  ascanio  my beatrice is jealous 

and will brook no rival  you  ascanio  must finish the statue of hebe 

adieu  my sweetest dream   the last  



benvenuto spoke with effort  in a broken voice  colombe leaned

gracefully toward him  and put her hand in his 



 weep  my friend  weep   she said softly 



 yes  yes   said cellini  bursting into tears 



he stood for some time without speaking  weeping bitterly  and trembling

with emotion from head to foot  his forceful nature gladly sought relief

in tears too long held back  ascanio and colombe looked on in respectful

silence at this exhibition of bitter grief 



 except on the day when i wounded you  ascanio  except at the moment

when i saw your blood flow  i have not wept for twenty years   he said

at last  recovering his self control   but it has been a hard blow to

me  i was in such agony just now behind those trees that i was tempted

for a moment to plunge my dagger in my heart  and end it all  the only

thing that held my hand was your need of me  and so you saved my life 

all is as it should be  after all  ascanio has twenty years more of

happiness to give you than i have  colombe  and then he is my child  you

will be very happy together  and it will rejoice my father s heart 

benvenuto will succeed in triumphing over benvenuto himself  as well as

over his enemies  it is the lot of us creators to suffer  and perhaps

each one of my tears will cause some lovely statue to spring up  as each

of dante s tears became a sublime strain  you see  colombe  i am already

returning to my old love  my cherished sculpture  that love will never

forsake me  you did well to bid me weep  all the bitterness has been

washed from my heart by my tears  i am sad still  but i am kind once

more  and i will forget my pain in my efforts to save you  



ascanio took one of the master s hands  and pressed it warmly in his

own  colombe took the other  and put it to her lips  benvenuto breathed

more heavily than he had yet done  shaking his head  he said with a

smile   



 do not make it harder for me  but spare me  my children  it will be

better never to speak of this again  henceforth  colombe  i will be your

friend  nothing more  i will be your father  the rest is all a dream 

how let us talk of the danger which threatens you  and of what we are to

do  i overheard you a moment since discussing your plans  mon dieu  you

are very young  and neither of you has an idea of what life really is 

you offer yourselves  in the innocence of your heart  to the cruel blows

of destiny  unarmed  and you hope to vanquish malignity  avarice  all

the vile passions of which man is capable with your kind hearts and your

smiles  dear fools  i will be strong and cunning and implacable in your

stead  i am wonted to it  but you   god created you for happiness and

tranquillity  my lovely cherubs  and i will see to it that you fulfil

your destiny 



 ascanio  anger shall not furrow thy calm brow  grief  colombe  shall

not disturb the pure outlines of thy face  i will take you in my arms 

soft eyed  charming pair  i will bear you so through all the mire and

misery of life  and will not set you down until you have arrived safe

and sound at perfect joy  and then i ll gaze at you  and be happy in

your happiness  but you must have blind confidence in me  i have my own

peculiar ways  abrupt and hard to understand  and which may perhaps

alarm you a little  colombe  i conduct myself somewhat after the manner

of artillery  and i go straight to my goal  heedless of what i may meet

on the road  yes  i think more of the purity of my intentions  i

confess  than of the morality of the means i use  when i set about

modelling a beautiful figure i care but little whether the clay soils my

fingers  the figure finished  i wash my hands  and that s the end of it 

do you then  mademoiselle  with your refined and timorous heart  leave

me to answer to god for my acts  he and i understand each other  i have

a powerful combination to deal with  the count is ambitious  the provost

avaricious  and the duchess very subtle  they are each and all very

powerful  you are in their power  and in their hands  and two of them

have rights over you  it may perhaps be necessary to resort to craft and

violence  i shall arrange it  however  so that you and ascanio will have

no part in a contest in every way beneath you  come  colombe  are you

ready to close your eyes  and allow yourself to be led  when i say   do

this   will you do it    remain there   will you remain    go   will you

go  



 what does ascanio say  asked colombe 



 colombe   returned the apprentice   benvenuto is great and good  he

loves us and forgives the injury we have done him  let us obey him  i

implore you  



 command me  master   said colombe   and i will obey you as if you were

sent by god himself 



 very well  my child  i have but one thing more to ask you  it will cost

you dear  perhaps  but you must make up your mind to it  thereafter your

part will be confined to waiting  and allowing circumstances and myself

to do our work  in order that both of you may have more perfect faith in

me  and that you may confide unhesitatingly in one whose life may not be

unspotted  but whose heart has remained pure  i am about to tell you the

story of my youth  all stories resemble one another  alas  and sorrow

lies at the heart of every one  ascanio  i propose to tell you how my

beatrice  the angel of whom i have spoken to you  came to be associated

with my existence  you shall know who she was  and you will wonder less

no doubt at my determination to abandon colombe to you  when you realize

that by that sacrifice i am but beginning to pay to the child the debt i

owe the mother  your mother  a saint in paradise  ascanio  beatrice

would say blessed  stefana would say crowned  



 you have always told me  master  that you would tell me your whole

story some day  



 yes  and the moment has come to redeem my promise  you will have even

more confidence in me  colombe  when you know all the reasons i have for

loving our ascanio  



thereupon benvenuto took a hand of each of his children in his own  and

told them what follows  in his grave  melodious voice  beneath the

glimmering stars in the peaceful silence of the night 









iv





stefana





 twenty years since  i was twenty years old  as you are now  ascanio 

and i was at work with a florentine goldsmith named raphael del moro  he

was a good workman and did not lack taste  but he cared more for rest

than for work  allowing himself to be inveigled into attending parties

with disheartening facility  and  although he had little money  himself

leading astray those who were in his studio  very often i was left alone

in the house  singing over some piece of work i had in hand  in those

days i sang as scozzone does  all the sluggards in the city came as a

matter of course to master raphael for employment  or rather in quest of

pleasure  for he had the reputation of being too weak ever to quarrel 

one grows rich slowly with such habits as his  so he was always hard up 

and soon came to be the most discredited goldsmith in florence 



 i am wrong  he had a confrère who had even less custom than he 

although he was of a noble family  but it was not for irregularity in

meeting his obligations that gismondo gaddi was cried down  but for his

notorious lack of talent and his sordid avarice  as everything intrusted

to him left his hands imperfect or spoiled  and not a customer  unless

he happened to be a stranger  ventured into his shop  gismondo undertook

to earn his living by usury  and to loan money at enormous interest to

young men desirous of discounting their future prospects  this

profession succeeded better than the other  as gaddi always demanded

good security  and went into nothing without reliable guaranties  with

that exception  he was  as he himself said  very considerate and

long suffering  he loaned to everybody  compatriots and foreigners  jews

and christians  he would have loaned to st  peter upon the keys of

paradise  or to satan upon his estates in hell 



 need i say that he loaned to my poor raphael del moro  who consumed

every day his provision for the morrow  but whose sterling integrity

never wavered  their constant connection in business  and the social

ostracism to which both were subjected  tended to bring the two

goldsmiths together  del moro was deeply grateful for his confrère s

untiring amiability in the matter of advancing money  gaddi thoroughly

esteemed an honest and accommodating debtor  they were  in a word  the

best friends in the world  and gismondo would not have missed for an

empire one of the parties with which del moro regaled him 



 del moro was a widower  but he had a daughter of sixteen  named

stefana  from a sculptor s point of view stefana was not beautiful  and

yet her appearance was most striking  beneath her forehead  which was

almost too high and not smooth enough for a woman  one could see her

brain at work  so to speak  her great  moist eyes  of a velvety black

hue  moved you to respect and deep emotion as they rested upon you  an

ivory pallor overspread her face  which was lightened by a melancholy

yet charming expression  like the faint sunshine of an autumn morning  i

forget a crown of luxurious raven locks  and hands a queen might have

envied 



 stefana ordinarily stood bending slightly forward  like a lily swayed

by the wind  you might at times have taken her for a statue of

melancholy  when she stood erect  when her lovely eyes sparkled  when

her nostrils dilated  when her arm was outstretched to emphasize a

command  you would have adored her as the archangel gabriel  she

resembled you  ascanio  but you have less weakness of resolution and

capacity for suffering  the immortality of the soul was never more

clearly revealed to my eyes than in that slender  graceful body  del

moro  who feared his daughter almost as much as he loved her  was

accustomed to say that he had consigned to the tomb only the body of his

wife  that stefana was her dead mother s soul 



 i was at this time an adventurous youth  an impulsive giddy pated

creature  i loved liberty before everything  i was bubbling over with

life  and i expended my surplus energy in foolish quarrels and foolish

love affairs  i worked nevertheless with no less passion than i put into

my pleasures  and despite my vagaries i was raphael s best workman  and

the only one in the establishment who earned any money  but what i did

well  i did by instinct  almost by chance  i had studied the ancients to

good purpose  for whole days i had gazed upon the bas reliefs and

statues of athens and rome  making studies with pencil and chisel  and

constant contact with these sublime artists of former days gave me

purity and precision of outline  but i was simply a successful imitator 

i did not create  still  i say again  i was incontestably and easily the

cleverest and most hardworking of del moro s comrades  i have since

learned that the master s secret wish was that i should marry his

daughter 



 but i was thinking little of settling down  i  faith  i was enamored of

independence  freedom from care  and an outdoor life  i was absent from

the workshop whole days at a time  i would return completely overdone

with fatigue  and yet in a few hours i would have overtaken and passed

raphael s other workmen  i would fight for a word  fall in love at a

glance  a fine husband i should have made 



 moreover  my feelings when i was with stefana in no wise resembled

those aroused by the pretty girls of porta del prato or borgo pinti  she

almost overawed me  if i had been told that i loved her otherwise than

as an elder sister i should have laughed  when i returned from one of my

escapades i dared not look stefana in the face  she was more than stern 

she was sad  on the other hand  when fatigue or a praiseworthy zealous

impulse had detained me at home  i always sought stefana s

companionship  her sweet face  and her sweet voice  my affection for her

had in it something serious and sacred  which i did not at the time

fully understand  but which was very pleasant to me  very often  amid my

wildest excesses  the thought of stefana would pass through my mind  and

my companions would ask me why i had suddenly become thoughtful 

sometimes  when i was in the act of drawing my sword or my dagger  i

would pronounce her name as it were that of my patron saint  and i

noticed that whenever that occurred i retired from the contest unhurt 

but this tender feeling for the dear child  innocent  lovely  and

affectionate as she was  lay dormant at the bottom of my heart as in a

sanctuary 



 for her part  it is certain  that she was as full of indulgence and

kindly feeling for me as she was cold and dignified with my slothful

comrades  she sometimes came to sit in the studio beside her father  and

i would sometimes feel her eyes fixed on my face as she bent over my

work  i was proud and happy in her preference  although i did not

explain my feeling to myself  if one of my comrades indulged in a little

vulgar flattery  and informed me that my master s daughter was in love

with me  i received his insolence so wrathfully that he never repeated

it 



 an accident which befell stefana proved to me how deeply she had become

rooted in my heart 



 one day when she was in the studio looking at a piece of work  she did

not take away her little white hand quickly enough  and a bungling

workman  who was tipsy  i think  struck the little finger and the finger

beside it with his chisel  the poor child shrieked at first  then  as if

ashamed of it  smiled to reassure us  but her hand as she held it up was

covered with blood  i think i should have killed the fellow had my mind

not been concentrated upon her 



 gismondo gaddi  who was present  said that he knew a surgeon in the

neighborhood  and ran to fetch him  the villanous medicaster dressed the

wound  and came every day to see stefana  but he was so ignorant and

careless that gangrene set in  thereupon the ass pompously declared

that  despite his efforts  stefana s right arm would always be

paralyzed 



 raphael del moro was in too straitened circumstances to be able to

consult another physician  but when i heard the imbecile announce his

decision  i refused to abide by it  i hurried to my room  emptied the

purse which contained all my savings  and ran off to giacomo rastelli of

perouse  the pope s surgeon  and the most eminent practitioner in all

italy  at my earnest entreaty  and as the sum i offered him was by no

means contemptible  he came at once  exclaiming   o these lovers   after

examining the wound  he announced that he would answer for it that

stefana would be able to use the right arm as well as the other within a

fortnight  i longed to embrace the worthy man  he set about dressing the

poor maimed lingers  and stefana was at once relieved  but a day or two

later it was necessary to remove the decayed bone 



 she asked me to be present at the operation to give her courage 

whereas i was entirely lacking in it myself  and my heart felt very

small in my breast  master giacomo made use of some great instrument

which caused stefana terrible pain  she could not restrain her groans 

which echoed in my heart  my temples were bathed in a cold perspiration 



 at last the torture exceeded my strength  the cruel tool which tortured

those poor  delicate fingers tortured me no less  i rose  begging master

giacomo to suspend the operation  and to wait for me a quarter of an

hour 



 i went down to the studio  and there  as if inspired by my good genius 

i made an instrument of thin  sharp steel which would cut like a razor 

i returned to the surgeon  who with that operated so gently and easily

that the dear girl felt almost no pain  in five minutes it was all over 

and a fortnight later she gave me the hand to kiss  which  as she said 

i had preserved 



 but it would be impossible for me to describe the poignant emotion i

passed through when i saw the suffering of my poor résignée  as i

sometimes called her 



 resignation was  in truth  the natural condition of her mind  stefana

was not happy  her father s improvidence and recklessness distressed her

beyond measure  her only consolation was religion  like all unhappy

women she was pious  very often  as i entered some church to pray  for i

have always loved god  i would spy stefana in a corner weeping and

praying 



 whenever  as too frequently happened  master del moro s reckless

extravagance left her penniless  she would appeal to me with a simple 

trustful confidence  which went to my heart  she would say  dear girl 

with the simplicity characteristic of noble hearts   benvenuto  i beg

you to pass the night at work  to finish that reliquary  or that ewer 

for we have no money at all  



 i soon adopted the habit of submitting to her every piece of work that

i completed  and she would point out its imperfections and advise me

with extraordinary sagacity  solitude and sorrow had inspired and

elevated her mind more than one would think possible  her words  which

were at once innocent and profound  taught me more than one secret of my

art  and often opened new possibilities to my mind 



 i remember one day when i showed her a medal which i was engraving for

a cardinal  and which had a representation of the cardinal s head on one

side  and on the other jesus walking on the sea  and holding out his

hand to st  peter  with this legend    quare dubitasti    wherefore

didst thou doubt 



 stefana was well pleased with the portrait  which was a very good

likeness  and very well executed  she looked at the reverse in silence

for a long while 



  the face of our lord is very beautiful   she said at last   and if it

were intended for apollo or jupiter i should find nothing to criticise 

but jesus is something more than beautiful  jesus is divine  the lines

of this face are superb in their purity  but where is the soul  i admire

the man  but i look in vain for the god  consider  benvenuto  that you

are not an artist simply  but a christian as well  my heart  you know 

has often bled  that is to say  alas  my heart has often doubted  and i 

too  have shaken off my depression when i saw jesus holding out his hand

to me  and have heard the sublime words   wherefore hast thou doubted  

ah  benvenuto  your image of him is less beautiful than he  in his

celestial countenance there was the sadness of the afflicted father  and

the clemency of the king who pardons  his forehead shone  but his mouth

smiled  he was more than great  he was good  



  wait a moment  stefana   said i 



 i effaced what i had done  and in a few moments i once more began upon

the savior s face under her eyes 



  is that better   i asked  as i handed it to her 



  oh yes   she replied  with tears in her eyes   so our blessed lord

appeared to me when i was heavy hearted  yes  i recognize him now by his

expression of compassion and majesty  ah  benvenuto  i advise you always

henceforth to follow this course  before taking the wax in hand  be sure

of the thought  you possess the instrument  master the expression  you

have the material part  seek the spiritual part  let your fingers never

be aught but the servants of your mind  



 such was the counsel given me by that child of sixteen  in her sublime

good sense  when i was alone i reflected upon what she had said to me 

and realized that she was right  thus did she guide and enlighten my

instinct  having the form in my mind  i sought the idea  and to combine

the form and the idea in such wise that they would issue from my hands a

perfectly blended whole  as minerva came forth all armed from the brain

of jupiter 



 mon dieu  how lovely is youth  and how its memories do overpower one 

ascanio  colombe  this lovely evening we are passing together reminds me

of all those i passed by stefana s side sitting upon a bench outside her

father s house  she would gaze up at the sky  and i would gaze at her 

it was twenty years ago  but it seems only yesterday  i put out my hand

and fancy that i can feel hers  but it is yours  my children  what god

does is well done 



 oh  simply to see her in her white dress was to feel tranquillity steal

over my soul  often when we parted we had not uttered a word  and yet i

carried away from those silent interviews all sorts of fine and noble

thoughts  which made me better and greater 



 but all this had an end  as all happiness in this world has 



 raphael del moro had but little farther to go to reach the lowest

depths of destitution  he owed his kind neighbor gismondo gaddi two

thousand ducats  which he knew not how to pay  the thought drove this

honest man to desperation  he wished at least to save his daughter  and

intrusted his purpose to give her to me to one of the workmen  doubtless

that he might broach the subject to me  but he was one of the idiots

whom i had lost my temper with when they threw stefana s sisterly

affection at my head as a reproach  the blockhead did not even allow

raphael to finish 



  abandon that scheme  master del moro   he said   the suggestion would

not be favorably received  my word for it  



 the goldsmith was proud  he believed that i despised him on account of

his poverty  and he never referred to the subject again 



 some time after  gismondo gaddi came to demand payment of his debt  and

when raphael asked for more time 



  hark ye   said gismondo   give me your daughter s hand  and i will

give you a receipt in full  



 del moro was transported with joy  to be sure gaddi had the reputation

of being a little covetous  a little high tempered  and a little

jealous  but he was rich  and what the poor esteem and envy most  alas 

is wealth  when raphael mentioned this unexpected proposition to his

daughter  she made no reply  but that evening  as we left the bench

where we had been sitting together  to return to the house  she said to

me   benvenuto  gismondo gaddi has asked my hand in marriage  and my

father has given his consent  



 with those simple words she left me  i leaped to my feet  and in a sort

of frenzy i went out of the city and wandered about over the fields 

throughout the night  now running like a madman  and again lying at full

length upon the grass and weeping  a myriad of mad  desperate  frenzied

thoughts chased one another through my disordered brain 



  she  stefana  the wife of that odious gismondo   i said to myself 

when i had in some degree recovered my self control  and was seeking to

collect my wits   the thought overpowers me and terrifies me as well 

and as she would certainly prefer me  she makes a mute appeal to my

friendship  to my jealousy  ah  yes  i am jealous  furiously jealous 

but have i the right to be  gaddi is morose and violent tempered  but

let us be just to one another  what woman would be happy with me  am i

not brutal  capricious  restless  forever involved in dangerous quarrels

and unholy intrigues  could i conquer myself  no  never  so long as the

blood boils in my veins as at present  i shall always have my hand on my

dagger  and my foot outside the house 



  poor stefana  i should make her weep and suffer  i should see her lose

color and pine away  i should hate myself  and should soon come to hate

her as well  as a living reproach  she would die  and i should have her

death to answer for  no  i am not made  alas  i feel that i am not  for

calm  peaceful family joys  i must have liberty  space  conflict 

anything rather than the peace and monotony of happiness  i should break

in my grasp that fragile  delicate flower  i should torture that dear 

loving heart by my insults  and my own existence  my own heart would be

blighted by remorse  but would she be happier with this gismondo gaddi 

why should she marry him  we were so happy together  after all  stefana

must know that an artist s instincts and temperament do not easily

accommodate themselves to the rigid bonds  the commonplace necessities

of family life  i must say farewell to all my dreams of glory  renounce

the thought of making my name famous  and abandon art  which thrives on

liberty and power  how can one create when held a prisoner at the

domestic fireside  say  o dante alighieri  o michel angelo  my master 

how you would laugh to see your pupil rocking his children to sleep  and

asking his wife s pardon  no  i will be brave in my own behalf  and

generous to stefana  sad and alone i will dream out my dream and fulfil

my destiny  



 you see  my children  that i make myself no better than i am  there was

some selfishness in my decision  but there was also much deep and

sincere affection for stefana  and my raving seemed to border closely on

common sense 



 the next morning i returned to the workshop in a reasonably tranquil

frame of mind  stefana also seemed calm  but she was paler than usual  a

month passed thus  one evening stefana said  as we parted   



  in a week  benvenuto  i shall be gismondo gaddi s wife  



 as she did not leave me at once  i had time to look at her  she stood

with her hand on her heart  bending beneath her burden of sorrow  and

her sweet smile was sad enough to make one weep  she gazed at me with a

sorrowful expression  but without the least indication of reproach  it

seemed to me as if my angel  ready to leave earth behind  was saying

farewell to me  she stood thus  mute and motionless  for a moment  then

entered the house 



 i was destined never to see her more in this world 



 this time again i left the city bareheaded and running like a madman 

but i did not return the next day  or the next  i kept on until i

reached rome 



 i remained at rome five years  i laid the foundation of my reputation 

i won the friendship of the rope  i had duels and love affairs and

artistic success  but i was not contented   something was lacking  amid

my engrossing occupations i never passed a day without turning my eyes

toward florence  there was no night when i did not see in my dreams

stefana  pale faced and sad  standing in the doorway of her father s

house  and gazing at me 



 after five years i received a letter from florence  sealed with black 

i read and reread it so many times that i know it now by heart 



 it ran thus   



  benvenuto  i am dying  benvenuto  i loved you 



  listen to the dreams i dreamed  i knew you as well as i knew myself  i

foresaw the power that is in you  and that will make you great some day 

your genius  which i read upon your broad forehead  in your ardent

glance and your passionate gestures  would impose grave duties on her

who should bear your name  i was ready to undertake them  happiness had

for me the solemnity of a divine mission  i would not have been your

wife  benvenuto  i would have been your friend  your sister  your

mother  your noble existence belongs to all mankind  i know  and i would

have assumed no other right than that of diverting you in your ennui  of

uplifting you in your moments of depression  you would have been free 

my friend  always and everywhere  alas  i had long since become

accustomed to your lamentable absences from home  to all the exactions

of your impulsive nature  to all the whims of your tempest loving heart 

every powerful temperament has pressing needs  the longer the eagle has

soared aloft  the longer he is obliged to rest on earth  but when you

had torn yourself free from the feverish dreams of your genius  i would

have found once more at the awakening my sublime benvenuto  whom i love

so dearly  and who would have belonged to me alone  i would never have

reproached you for the hours of neglect  for they would have contained

no insult for me  for my own part  knowing you to be jealous  as is

every noble heart  jealous as the god of holy writ  i would have

remained in seclusion when you were away  in the solitude which i love 

awaiting your return and praying for you 



  such would my life have been 



  but when i saw that you abandoned me  i bowed submissively to god s

will and yours  closed my eyes  and placed my fate in the hands of duty 

my father ordered me to enter into a marriage which would save him from

dishonor  and i obeyed  my husband has been harsh  stern  pitiless  he

has not been content with my docile submission  but demanded a love

beyond my power to give  and punished me brutally for my involuntary

sadness  i resigned myself to endure everything  i have been  i trust  a

pure and dignified spouse  but always very sad at heart  benvenuto  god

has rewarded me  however  even in this world  by giving me a son  my

child s kisses have for four years past prevented me from feeling

insults  blows  and last of all poverty  for my husband ruined himself

trying to gain too much  and he died last month from chagrin at his

ruin  may god forgive him as i do 



  i shall be dead myself within the hour  dead from the effects of my

accumulated suffering  and i bequeath my son to you  benvenuto 



  perhaps all is for the best  who can say if my womanly weakness would

have been equal to the task i would have undertaken with you  he  my

ascanio   he is like me   will be a stronger and more submissive

companion for you  he will love you better  if not more dearly  i am not

jealous of him 



  do for my child what i would have done for you 



  adieu  my friend  i loved you and i love you still  and i tell you

without shame or remorse  at the very doors of eternity  for my love was

holy  adieu  be great  and i shall be happy  raise your eyes sometimes

to heaven that i may see you 



  your stefana   



 now  colombe and ascanio  will you have confidence in me  and are you

ready to do what i advise  



the young people replied with a single exclamation 









v





domiciliary visits





on the day following that on which this story was told in the garden of

the petit nesle  by the moon s pale light  benvenuto s studio wore its

accustomed aspect  the master was working at the gold salt dish  the

material for which he had so valiantly defended against the four bravos 

who strove to take it from him  and his life with it  ascanio was

chiselling madame d etampes s lily  jacques aubry  reclining lazily on a

lounging chair  was putting question after question to cellini  who paid

no attention to him  and imposed upon the inquisitive student the

necessity of framing his own replies  pagolo was gazing at catherine 

who was busy with some woman s work  hermann and the others were filing 

welding  chiselling  and scozzone s joyous singing furnished the element

of cheerfulness in this tranquil  busy scene 



the petit nesle was by no means so tranquil  for colombe had

disappeared 



there all was excitement and apprehension  they were seeking her

everywhere  and calling her name  dame perrine was shrieking at the top

of her voice  and the provost  who had been sent for in hot haste  was

trying to lay hold upon something  in the midst of the good woman s

lamentations  which might put him on the track of the absent one  who

was in all probability a fugitive 



 look you  dame perrine  do you say that you last saw her a few moments

after i went away last night   demanded the provost 



 alas  yes  messire  jésus dieu  what a misfortune  the poor  dear

child seemed a bit cast down as she went to take off all her beautiful

court fixings  she put on a simple white dress  saints in paradise  have

pity on us   and then she said to me   dame perrine  it s a lovely

evening  and i will go and take a turn or two in my path   it might have

been about seven o clock  madame here   added perrine  pointing to

pulchérie  the woman who had been installed as her assistant or

superior    madame here had already gone to her room  doubtless to work

at those lovely dresses which she makes so well  and i was at work

sewing in the room below  i don t know how long i remained there   it is

possible that after a while my poor tired eyes closed in spite of me 

and that i lost myself a moment  



 as usual   interposed pulchérie sharply 



 at all events   continued dame perrine  not deigning to reply to this

insidious slander   about ten o clock i left my chair and went to the

garden to see if colombe had not forgotten herself  i called and found

no one  i supposed then that she had gone to her own room and to bed

without disturbing me  as the dear child has done a thousand times 

merciful heaven  who would have thought  ah  messire le prévôt  i can

safely say that she followed no lover  but some ravisher  i reared her

in the way   



 and this morning   the provost broke in impatiently   this morning  



 this morning when i found that she didn t come down  holy virgin help

us  



 to the devil with your litanies   cried messire d estourville   say

what you have to say simply and without all these jeremiads  this

morning  



 ah  monsieur le prévôt  you can t prevent my weeping until she is

found  this morning  messire  being alarmed at not seeing her  she is

always so early   i knocked at her door to wake her  and  as she did not

answer  i opened the door  no one  the bed was not even rumpled 

messire  with that i called and cried  and lost my head  and you want me

not to weep  



 dame perrine   said the provost sternly   have you admitted any one

here during my absence  



 i admit any one  the idea   rejoined the governess with every

indication of stupefaction  feeling a little conscience stricken in that

regard   didn t you forbid me  messire  since when  pray  have i

allowed myself to disobey your orders  admit some one  oh yes  of

course  



 this benvenuto  for instance  who had the assurance to deem my daughter

so fair  has he never tried to buy you  



 good lack  he would have been more likely to try to fly to the moon  i

would have received him prettily  i promise you  



 i am to understand  then  that you have never admitted a man  a young

man  to the petit nesle  



 a young man  merciful heaven  a young man  why not the devil himself  



 pray who is the handsome boy   said pulchérie   who has knocked at the

door at least ten times since i have been here  and in whose face i have

shut the door as often  



 a handsome boy  your sight must be poor  my dear  unless it was comte

d orbec  ah  bon dieu  i know  you may mean ascanio  you know ascanio 

messire  the young fellow who saved your life  yes  i did give him my

shoe buckles to repair  but he  that apprentice  wear glasses  my love 

may these walls and pavements speak  if they ever saw him here  



 enough   interposed the provost severely   if you have betrayed my

confidence  dame perrine  i swear that you shall pay me for it  i am

going now to this benvenuto  god knows how the clown will receive me 

but go i must  



contrary to his expectation benvenuto received the provost with perfect

civility  in the face of his cool and easy manner and his good humor 

messire d estourville did not dare mention his suspicions  but he said

that his daughter  having been unnecessarily alarmed the evening before 

had fled in her panic terror like a mad girl  that it was possible that

she might have taken refuge in the grand nesle without benvenuto s

knowledge   or else that she might have fainted somewhere in the grounds

as she was passing through  in short  he lied in the most bungling way

imaginable 



but cellini courteously accepted all his fables and all his excuses 

indeed  he was so obliging as to appear to notice nothing out of the

way  he did more  he sympathized with the provost with all his heart 

declaring that he would be happy to assist in restoring his daughter to

a father who had always hedged her around with such touching affection 

to hear him  one might suppose the fugitive was very much in the wrong 

and could not too soon return to so pleasant a home and so loving a

parent  moreover  to prove the sincerity of his interest in messire

d estourville s affliction  he placed himself at his disposal to assist

him in his search in the grand nesle and elsewhere 



the provost  half convinced  and the more deeply affected by these

eulogiums  in that he knew in his heart that he did not deserve them 

began a careful search of his former property  of which he knew all the

ins and outs  there was not a door that he did not open  not a wardrobe

nor a chest into which he did not peer  as if by inadvertence  having

inspected every nook and corner of the hotel itself  he went into the

garden  and searched the arsenal  foundry  stables and cellar 

scrutinizing everything most rigorously  benvenuto  faithful to his

first offer  accompanied him throughout his investigations  and assisted

him to the utmost of his ability  offering him all the keys  and calling

his attention to this or that corridor or closet which the provost

overlooked  he advised him to leave one of his people on guard in each

spot as he left it  lest the fugitive should evade him by stealing from

place to place 



having continued his perquisitions for two hours to no purpose  messire

d estourville  feeling sure that he had omitted nothing  and overwhelmed

by his host s politeness  left the grand nesle  with profuse thanks and

apologies to its master 



 whenever it suits your pleasure to return   said the goldsmith   and if

you desire to renew your investigations here  my house is open to you at

all times  as when it was your own  indeed it is your right  messire 

did we not sign a treaty whereby we agreed to live on neighborly terms  



the provost thanked benvenuto  and as he knew not how to return his

courtesy  he loudly praised  as he went away  the colossal statue of

mars  which the artist was at work upon  as we have said  benvenuto led

him around it  and complacently called his attention to its amazing

proportions  it was more than sixty feet high and nearly twenty in

circumference at its base 



messire d estourville withdrew much dejected  as he had failed to find

his daughter in the precincts of the grand nesle  he was convinced that

she had found shelter somewhere in the city  but even at that time the

city was sufficiently large to make his own task as chief officer of the

police an embarrassing one  then  too  there was this question to be

solved  had she been kidnapped  or had she fled  was she the victim of

some other person s violence  or had she yielded to her own impulse 

there was nothing to set at rest his uncertainty upon this point  he

hoped that in the first event she would succeed in escaping  and in the

second would return of her own volition  he therefore waited with what

patience he could muster  none the less questioning dame perrine twenty

times a day  who passed her time calling upon the saints in paradise 

and swearing by all the gods that she had admitted no one  and indeed

she was no more suspicious than messire d estourville himself of

ascanio 



that day and the next passed without news  the provost thereupon put all

his agents in the field  a thing he had hitherto omitted to do  in order

that the unfortunate occurrence  in which his reputation was so deeply

interested  might not be noised abroad  to be sure he simply gave them

colombe s description  without giving them her name  and their

investigations were made upon an entirely different pretext from the

real one  but although he resorted to all his secret sources of

information  all their searching was without result 



surely he had never been an affectionate or gentle father  but if he was

not in despair  he was in a bad temper  and his pride suffered if his

heart did not  he thought indignantly of the fine match which the little

fool would perhaps miss by reason of this escapade  and with furious

rage of the witticisms and sarcasms with which his misadventure would be

greeted at court 



he had to make up his mind at last to confide his woful tale to comte

d orbec  colombe s  fiancé  was grieved by the news  in the same way as

a merchant is grieved who learns that part of his cargo has been

jettisoned  and not otherwise  he was a philosopher  was the dear count 

and promised his worthy friend that  if the affair did not make too much

noise  the marriage should come off none the less  and  as he was a man

who knew how to strike when the iron was hot  he seized the opportunity

to whisper to the provost a few words as to the plans of madame

d etampes regarding colombe 



the provost was dazzled at the honor which might be in store for him 

his anger redoubled  and he cursed the ungrateful girl who was ruining

her own chances of such a noble destiny  we spare our readers the

details of the conversation between the two old courtiers to which this

avowal of comte d orbec led  we will say simply that grief and hope were

combined therein in a curiously touching way  as misfortune brings men

together  the prospective father in law and son in law parted more

closely united than ever  and without making up their minds to renounce

the brilliant prospects of which they had caught a glimpse 



they agreed to keep the occurrence secret from everybody  but the

duchesse d etampes was too intimate a friend  and too deeply interested

as an accomplice  not to be let into their confidence  it was a wise

move on their part  for she took the thing much more to heart than the

father and husband had done  and  as we know  she was better qualified

than any other to give the provost information and direct his search 



she knew of ascanio s love for colombe  and she had herself forced him 

so to speak  to listen to the whole conspiracy  the young man  realizing

that a blow was to be aimed at the honor of his beloved  had perhaps

resolved upon some desperate act  but ascanio had himself told her that

colombe did not love him  and not loving him she would be unlikely to

lend herself to such a design  now the duchesse d etampes knew him upon

whom her suspicion first fell sufficiently well to be sure that he would

never have the courage to defy his mistress s scorn and her resistance 

and yet  despite all her reasoning  and although in her eyes all the

probabilities pointed to ascanio s innocence  her jealous instinct told

her that colombe must be sought at the hôtel de nesle  and that they

must make sure of ascanio before everything 



but  on the other hand  madame d etampes could not tell her friends the

source of that conviction  for she must in that case confess her love

for ascanio  and that  in the imprudence of her passion  she had made

known to him all her designs upon colombe  she simply said to them that

she would be very much mistaken if benvenuto were not the culprit 

ascanio his accomplice  and the grand nesle the place of concealment  to

no purpose did the provost argue with her  and swear that he had

inspected and searched every corner  she would not yield her point 

saying that she had her reasons for the faith that was in her  and she

was so obstinate in her opinion that she ended by arousing suspicion in

the mind of messire d estourville  who was certain nevertheless that he

had made a thorough search 



 however   said the duchess   i will send for ascanio  i will see him

and question him myself  never fear  



 o madame  you are too kind   said the provost 



 and you too stupid   muttered the duchess between her teeth  she

dismissed them  and set about reflecting upon the method she should

adopt to induce the young man to come to her  but before she had decided

upon any  ascanio was announced  it was as if he had anticipated her

wish 



he was cold and calm  the gaze with which madame d etampes received him

was so piercing that you would have said she wished to read to the very

bottom of his heart  but ascanio did not seem to notice it 



 madame   said he  as he saluted her   i have come to show you your

lily  which is almost finished  almost nothing is lacking to complete it

save the two hundred thousand crown dewdrop you promised to furnish me  



 very well  and your colombe   was the only reply vouchsafed by madame

d etampes 



 if you mean mademoiselle d estourville  madame   rejoined ascanio

gravely   i will beg you on my knees not to pronounce her name again

before me  yes  madame  i most humbly and earnestly implore you that

this subject may never be mentioned between us  in pity s name  



 aha  spite   said the duchess  who did not remove her penetrating gaze

from ascanio s face for an instant 



 whatever the feeling which influences me  madame  and though i were to

be disgraced in your eyes  i shall venture to decline hereafter to talk

with you upon this subject  i have sworn a solemn oath that everything

connected with that memory shall be dead and buried in my heart  



 am i mistaken   thought the duchess   and has ascanio no part in this

transaction  can it be that the child has followed some other adorer 

voluntarily or perforce  and  although lost to my ambitious schemes  has

served the interests of my passion by her flight  



having indulged in these reflections beneath her breath  she continued 

aloud   



 ascanio  you beg me not to speak of her again  but you will at least

allow me to speak of yourself  you see that in obedience to your

entreaty i do not insist  but who knows if this second subject will not

be even more disagreeable to you than the first  who knows   



 forgive me for interrupting you  madame   said the young man   but your

kindness in granting me the favor i ask emboldens me to ask another 

although of noble birth  i am simply a poor  obscure youth  reared in

the gloom of a goldsmith s workshop  and from that artistic cloister i

am suddenly transported to a brilliant sphere  involved in the destiny

of empires  and  weak creature that i am  having powerful noblemen for

enemies  and a king for rival  and such a king  madame  françois i  

one of the most powerful princes in christendom  i have suddenly found

myself elbow to elbow with the most illustrious names of the age  i have

loved hopelessly  i have been honored with a love i could not return 

and with whose love  great god  yours  madame  one of the loveliest and

noblest women on earth  all this has sown confusion within me and

without  it has bewildered and crushed me  madame 



 i am as terrified as a dwarf awaking to find himself among giants  i

haven t an idea in its place  not a feeling which i can explain  i feel

lost among all these terrible animosities  all these implacable

passions  all these soaring ambitions  madame  give me time to breathe 

i conjure you  permit the poor shipwrecked wretch to collect his

thoughts  the convalescent to recover his strength  time  i hope  will

restore order in my mind and my life  time  madame  give me time  and in

pity s name see in me to day only the artist who comes to ask if his

lily is to your taste  



the duchess stared at ascanio in doubt and amazement  she had not

supposed that this young man  this child  was capable of speaking in

this grave  stern  poetic fashion  she felt morally constrained to obey

him  and confined her conversation to the lily  praising and advising

ascanio  and promising to do her utmost to send him very soon the large

diamond to complete his work  ascanio thanked her  and took his leave

with every mark of gratitude and respect 



 can that be ascanio   said madame d etampes to herself  when he had

gone   he seems ten years older  what gives him this almost imposing

gravity  is it suffering  is it happiness  is he sincere  in short  or

acting under the influence of that accursed benvenuto  is he playing a

part with the talent of a consummate artist  or is he simply following

his own nature  



anne was perplexed  the strange vertigo which gradually overpowered all

those who contended with benvenuto cellini began to steal over her 

despite her strength of mind  she set spies upon ascanio  who followed

him on the rare occasions when he left the studio  but that step led to

no result  at last she sent for the provost and comte d orbec  and

advised them  as another would have ordered  to make a second and

unexpected domiciliary visit to the grand nesle 



they followed her advice  but although surprised at his work  benvenuto

received them even more cordially than he received the provost alone on

the former occasion  one would have said  so courteous and expansive was

he  that their presence implied no suspicions that were insulting to

him  he told comte d orbec good humoredly of the ambush that he fell

into as he left his house with his golden burden a few days before   on

the same day  he observed  on which mademoiselle d estourville

disappeared  this time as before he offered to accompany his visitors

through the château  and to assist the provost in recovering his

authority as a father  whose sacred duties he understood so well  he was

very happy that he happened to be at home to do honor to his guests  for

he was to start that same day within two hours for romorantin  having

been named by françois i   in his condescension  as one of the artists

who were to go to meet the emperor 



for events in the world of politics had moved on as rapidly as those of

our humble narrative  charles v   emboldened by his rival s public

promise  and by the secret undertaking of madame d etampes  was within

a few day s journey of paris  a deputation had been selected to go out

to receive him  and d orbec and the provost found cellini in travelling

costume 



 if he leaves paris with the rest of the escort   d orbec whispered to

the provost   in all probability he didn t carry off colombe  and we

have no business here  



 i told you so before we came   retorted the provost 



however  they decided to go through with their perquisition  and set

about it with painstaking minuteness  benvenuto accompanied them at

first  but as he saw that their investigations were likely to be very

prolonged  he asked their permission to leave them  and return to the

studio to give some orders to his workmen  as he was to take his leave

very soon  and desired to find the preparations for casting his jupiter

finished at his return 



he did in fact return to the studio  and distributed the work among his

men  bidding them obey ascanio as if he were himself  he then said a few

words in italian in ascanio s ear  bade them all adieu  and prepared to

take his departure  a horse all saddled  and held by little jehan 

awaited him in the outer courtyard 



at that moment scozzone went up to benvenuto and took him aside 



 do you know  master   she said with a sober face   that your departure

leaves me in a very difficult position  



 how so  my child  



 pagolo is becoming fonder of me all the time  



 ah  is it so  



 and he is forever talking to me about his love  



 what do you reply  



 dame  as you bade me  master  i say that i will see  and that perhaps

it may be arranged  



 very well  



 how is it very well  you don t understand  benvenuto  that he takes

everything that i say to him most seriously  and that i may be entering

into a real engagement with him  it s a fortnight since you laid down a

rule of conduct for me to adopt  is it not  



 yes  i think so  i hardly remember  



 but i have a better memory than you  during the first five days i

replied by reasoning gently with him  i told him he must try to conquer

his passion  and love me no more  the next five days i listened in

silence  and that was a very compromising kind of an answer  but you

bade me do it  so i did it  since then i have been driven to talk of my

duty to you  and yesterday  master  i reached a point where i besought

him to be generous  while he pressed me to confess my love for him  



 if that is so  it puts a different face on the matter   said benvenuto 



 ah  at last   said scozzone 



 yes  now listen  little one  during the first three days of my absence 

you will let him think that you love him  during the next three  you

will confess your love  



 what  you bid me do that  benvenuto   cried scozzone  deeply wounded at

the master s too great confidence in her 



 never you fear  what have you to reproach yourself for when i authorize

you to do it  



 mon dieu  nothing  i know   said scozzone   but being placed as i am

between your indifference and his love  i may end by falling in love

with him outright  



 nonsense  in six days  aren t you strong enough to remain indifferent

to him six days  



 yes  indeed  i give you six days  but don t remain away seven  i beg

you  



 no fear  my child  i will return in time  adieu  scozzone  



 adieu  master   returned scozzone  sulking  smiling  and weeping all at

once 



while cellini was giving catherine these instructions  the provost and

d orbec returned to the studio 



when they were left to themselves  with unrestricted freedom of

movement  they went about their search in a sort of frenzy  they

explored the garrets and cellars  sounded all the walls  moved all the

furniture  they detained all the servants they met  and displayed the

ardor of creditors with the patience of hunters  a hundred times they

retraced their steps  examining the same thing again and again  like a

sheriff s officer with a writ to serve  and when they had finished they

were flushed and excited  but had discovered nothing 



 well  messieurs   said benvenuto  preparing to mount his horse   you

found nothing  eh  so much the worse  so much the worse  i understand

what a painful thing it must be for turn sensitive hearts like yours 

but notwithstanding my sympathy with your suffering and my desire to

assist in your search i must begone  if you feel called upon to visit

the grand nesle in my absence  do not hesitate  but make yourself

perfectly at home here  i have given orders that the house be open to

you at all times  my only consolation for leaving you in so anxious a

frame of mind is the hope that i shall learn upon my return that you

have found your daughter  monsieur le prévôt  and you your fair

 fiancée   monsieur d orbec  adieu  messieurs  



thereupon he turned to his companions  who were standing in a group at

the door  all save ascanio  who doubtless did not care to stand faee to

face with his rival 



 adieu  my children   he said   if during my absence monsieur le

prévôt desires to inspect my house a third time  do not forget to

receive him as its former master  



with that little jehan threw open the door  and benvenuto galloped away 



 you see that we are idiots  my dear fellow   said comte d orbec to the

provost   when a man has kidnapped a girl  he doesn t go off to

romorantin with the court  









vi





charles the fifth at fontainebleau





it was not without grave doubts and a terrible sinking at the heart that

charles v  stepped foot upon french territory  where earth and air were 

so to speak  his enemies  whose king he had treated unworthily when he

was a prisoner in his hands  and whose dauphin he had perhaps

poisoned   he was at least accused of it  europe anticipated terrible

reprisals on the part of françois i  from the moment that his rival

placed himself in his power  but charles s audacity  great gambler in

empires that he was  would not permit him to draw back  and as soon as

he had skilfully felt the ground and paved the way  he boldly crossed

the pyrenees 



he counted upon finding devoted friends at the french court  and thought

that he could safely trust to three guaranties  the ambition of madame

d etampes  the overweening conceit of the connétable anne de

montmorency  and the king s chivalrous nature 



we have seen how and for what reason the duchess chose to serve his

interests  with the constable it was a different matter  the great

stumbling block in the way of statesmen of all lands and all periods is

the question of alliances  politics  which  in this matter and many

others  is perforce conjectural only  is often mistaken  alas  like the

science of medicine  in studying the symptoms of affinities between

peoples  and in risking remedies for their animosities  now the

constable was a monomaniac on the subject of the spanish alliance  he

had got it into his head that france s salvation lay in that direction 

and provided that he could satisfy charles v   who had been at war with

his master twenty years out of twenty five  he cared but little how much

he displeased his other allies  the turks and the protestants  or let

slip the most magnificent opportunities  like that which gave flanders

to françois i 



the king had blind confidence in montmorency  in truth the constable had

in the last war against the emperor displayed a hitherto unheard of

resolution  and had checked the enemy s advance  to be sure he did it at

the cost of the ruin of a province  by laying the country waste before

him  by devastating a tenth part of france  but what especially

impressed the king was his minister s haughty roughness of manner  his

inflexible obstinacy  which to a superficial mind might seem cleverness

and unswerving firmness of resolution  the result was that françois

listened to the  great suborner of men   as brantôme calls him  with a

deference equal to the fear inspired in his inferiors by this terrible

reciter of  paternosters   who alternated his prayers with hangings 



charles v  could therefore safely rely upon the persevering friendship

of the constable 



he placed even more reliance upon his rival s generosity  indeed 

françois i  carried magnanimity to an absurd point 



 my kingdom   he said   has no toll house  like a bridge  and i do not

sell my hospitality   the astute charles knew that he could trust the

word of the  knightly king  



nevertheless  when the emperor was fairly  upon french territory  he

could not overcome his apprehension and his doubts  he found the king s

two sons awaiting him at the frontier  and throughout his journey they

overwhelmed him with attentions and honors  but the crafty monarch

shuddered as he thought that all this appearance of cordiality might

conceal some deep laid snare 



 i must say that i sleep very ill   he said   in a foreign country  



he brought an anxious preoccupied face to the fêtes which were given

him  and  as he advanced farther and farther toward the heart of the

country  he became more and more sad and gloomy 



whenever he rode into a city  he would ask himself  amid all the

haranguing  as he passed beneath the triumphal arches  if that was the

city where he was to be imprisoned  then he would murmur beneath his

breath   not this or any other city  but all france  is my dungeon  all

these assiduous courtiers are my jailers   and each hour as it passed

added something to the apprehension of this tiger  who believed himself

to be in a cage  and saw bars on all sides 



one day  as they were riding along  charles d orléans  a fascinating 

frolicsome child   who was in great haste to be amiable and gallant  as

a son of france  before dying of the plague like any peasant   leaped

lightly to the saddle behind the emperor and threw his arms about his

waist  crying gleefully   now you are my prisoner   charles became pale

as death  and nearly fainted 



at châtellerault  the poor imaginary captive was met by françois  who

welcomed him fraternally  and on the following day presented the whole

court to him   the valorous  magnificent nobility  the glory of the

country  and the artists and men of letters  the glory of the king  the

fêtes and merry makings began in good earnest  the emperor wore a brave

face everywhere  but in his heart he was afraid  and constantly

reproached himself for his imprudence  from time to time  as if to test

his liberty  he would go out at daybreak from the château where he had

lain at night  and he was delighted to see that his movements were not

interfered with outside of the honors paid him  but could he be sure

that he was not watched from a distance  sometimes  as if from mere

caprice  he changed the itinerary arranged for his journey  to the

despair of françois i   because part of the ceremonial prescribed by

him went for naught as a consequence 



when he was within two day s ride of paris he remembered with terror the

french king s sojourn at madrid  for an emperor the capital would seem

to be the most honorable place of detention  and at the same time the

surest  he therefore begged the king to escort him at once to

fontainebleau  of which he had heard so much  this overturned all of

françois s plans  but he was too hospitable to allow his disappointment

to appear  and at once sent word to the queen and all the ladies to

repair to fontainebleau 



the presence of his sister eleanora  and her confidence in her husband s

good faith  allayed the emperor s anxiety to some extent  but  although

reassured for the moment  charles v  was never able to feel at his ease

while he was within the dominions of the king of france  françois was

the mirror of the past  charles the type of the future  the sovereign of

modern times never rightly understood the hero of the middle ages  it

was impossible that there should be any real sympathy between the last

of the chevaliers and the first of the diplomatists 



it is true louis xi  might  strictly speaking  lay claim to this latter

title  but in our opinion louis xi  was not so much the scheming

diplomatist as the grasping miser 



on the day of the emperor s arrival there was a hunting party in the

forest of fontainebleau  hunting was a favorite pastime of françois i 

it was not much better than a terrible bore to charles v  nevertheless

he seized with avidity this further opportunity to see if he was not a

prisoner  he let the hunt pass  took a by road  and rode about at random

until he was lost  but when he found that he was entirely alone in the

middle of the forest  as free as the air that blew through the branches 

or as the birds that flew through the air  he was almost wholly

reassured  and began to recover his good humor in some measure  and yet

the anxious expression returned to his faee when  upon his making his

appearance at the rendezvous  françois came to him  flushed with the

excitement of the chase  and still holding in his hand the bleeding

boar spear  the warrior of marignano and pavia was much in evidence in

the king s pleasures 



 come  my dear brother  let us enjoy ourselves   said françois  passing

his arm through charles s in a friendly way  when they had both alighted

at the palace gate  and  leading him to the galerie de diane 

resplendent with the paintings of rosso and primaticcio   vrai dieu  you

are as thoughtful as i was at madrid  but you will agree  my dear

brother  that i had some reason for being so  for i was your prisoner 

while you are my guest  you are free  you are on the eve of a triumph 

rejoice therefore with us  if not because of the fêtes  which are

doubtless beneath the notice of a great politician like yourself  at

least in the thought that you are on your way to humble all those

beer drinking flemings  who presume to talk of renewing the communes 

or  better still  forget the rebels  and think only of enjoying yourself

with friends  does not my court impress you pleasantly  



 it is superb  my brother   said charles   and i envy you  i too have a

court  you have seen it  but a stern  joyless court  a gloomy assemblage

of statesmen and generals like lannoy  peschiara  and antonio de leyra 

but you have  beside your warriors and statesmen  beside your

montmorencys and dubellays  beside your scholars  beside budée 

duchâtel  and lascaris   beside all these you have your poets and your

artists  marot  jean goujon  primaticcio  benvenuto  and  above all 

your adorable women   marguerite de navarre  diane de poitiers 

catherine de medicis  and so many others  and verily i begin to believe 

my dear brother  that i would willingly exchange my gold mines for your

flower strewn fields  



 ah  but you have not yet seen the fairest of all these lovely flowers  

said françois naïvely to eleanora s brother 



 no  and i am dying with longing to see that marvellous pearl of

loveliness   said the emperor  who understood that the king alluded to

madame d etampes   but even now i think that it is well said that yours

is the fairest realm on earth  my brother  



 but you have the fairest countship  flanders  the fairest duchy 

milan  



 you refused the first last month   said the emperor  smiling   and i

thank you for so doing  but you covet the other  do you not   he added

with a sigh 



 ah  let us not talk of serious matters to day  my cousin  i beg you  

said françois   after the pleasures of war there is nothing  i confess 

which i like less to disturb than the pleasures of a festal occasion

like the present  



 it is the truth   rejoined charles  with the grimace of a miser  who

realizes that he must pay a debt   it is the truth that the milanese is

very dear to my heart  and that it would be like tearing my heart out to

give it to you  



 say rather to return it to me  my brother  that word would be more

accurate  and would perhaps soften your disappointment  but that is not

the matter in hand now  we must enjoy ourselves  we will talk of the

milanese later  



 gift or restitution  given or returned   said the emperor   you will

none the less possess one of the finest lordships in the world  for you

shall have it  my brother  it is decided  and i will keep my engagements

with you as faithfully as you keep yours with me  



 mon dieu   cried françois  beginning to be vexed at this everlasting

recurrence to serious matters   what do you regret  my brother  are you

not king of the spains  emperor of germany  count of flanders  and lord 

either by influence or by right of your sword  of all italy  from the

foot of the alps to the farthest point of calabria  



 but you have france   rejoined charles with a sigh 



 you have the indies and their golden treasures  you have peru and the

mines  



 but you have france  



 you reign over an empire so vast that the sun never sets upon it  



 but you have france  what would your majesty say  if i should cast an

eye on this diamond among kingdoms  as fondly and gloatingly as you gaze

upon that pearl of duchies  milan  



 look  you  my brother   said françois gravely   i have instincts

rather than ideas upon these momentous questions  but  as they say in

your country   do not touch the queen   so i say to you   do not touch

france   



 mon dieu   exclaimed charles   are we not cousins and allies  



 most certainly   was françois s reply   and i most earnestly hope that

nothing will happen henceforth to embitter our relationship or disturb

our alliance  



 i too hope so   said the emperor   but   he continued  with his cunning

smile and hypocritical expression   can i answer for the future  and

prevent my son philip  for instance  from falling out with your son

henri  



 such a quarrel would not be dangerous for france  if augustus is

succeeded by tiberius  



 what matter who the master is   said charles  waxing warm   the empire

will still be the empire  and the rome of the cæsars was still rome

when the cæsars had ceased to be cæsars in everything save name  



 true  but the empire of charles v  is not the empire of octavius  my

brother   said françois  a little piqued   pavia was a glorious battle 

but it was no actium  then  too  octavius was very wealthy  while 

notwithstanding your indian treasures and your peruvian mines  you are

well known to be in straitened circumstances financially  your unpaid

troops were driven to sack rome to procure means of subsistence  and now

that rome is sacked they are in revolt  



 and you  my brother   said charles   have alienated the royal domains 

as i am informed  and are driven to treat luther very tenderly  so that

the german princes may consent to loan you money  



 not to mention the fact   retorted françois   that your cortes is very

far from being so manageable as the senate  while i can boast that i

have freed the kings of france from their dependence forever  



 beware that your parliaments don t put you back into leading strings

some fine day  



the discussion was growing warm  both monarchs were getting excited  and

the long standing antipathy which had kept them apart so long  was

beginning to glow afresh  françois was on the point of forgetting the

duties of hospitality  and charles the dictates of prudence  when the

former suddenly remembered that he was beneath his own roof 



 on my word  my good brother   he exclaimed abruptly  laughing aloud   i

believe  by mahomet s belly  that we were near losing our tempers  i

told you that we must not talk of serious matters  but must leave such

discussions to our ministers  and keep for ourselves only our good

friendship  come  let us agree  once for all  that you are to have the

world  less france  and drop the subject  



 and less the milanese  my brother   said charles  realizing the

imprudence he had been guilty of  and seeking at once to avoid its

effects   for the milanese is yours  i have promised it to you  and i

renew my promise  



as they exchanged these mutual assurances of continuing good will  the

door of the gallery opened  and madame d etampes appeared  the king

walked quickly to meet her  took her hand  and led her to where the

emperor stood  who  seeing her then for the first time  and  being fully

informed as to what had taken place between her and monsieur de medina 

fixed his most penetrating gaze upon her as she approached 



 my brother   said the king smiling   do you see this fair dame  



 not only do i see her   replied charles   but i admire her  



 very well  you do not know what she wants  



 is it one of my spains  i will give it her  



 no  no  brother  not that  



 what then  



 she wants me to detain you at paris until you have destroyed the treaty

of madrid  and confirmed by acts the promise you have given me  



 if the advice is good  you should follow it   rejoined the emperor 

bowing low before the duchess  as much to hide the sudden pallor which

these words caused to overspread his face  as to perform an act of

courtesy 



he had no time to say more  nor could françois see the effect produced

by the words he had laughingly let fall  and which charles was quite

ready to take seriously  for the door opened again and the whole court

poured into the gallery 



during the half hour preceding dinner  when this clever  cultivated 

corrupt throng was assembled in the salons of the palace  the scene we

described apropos of the reception at the louvre was re enacted in all

its essential details  there were the same men and the same women  the

same courtiers and the same valets  loving and malevolent glances were

exchanged as usual  and sarcastic remarks and gallant speeches were

indulged in with the customary freedom 



charles v   spying anne de montmorency  whom he with good reason deemed

to be his surest ally  went to him  and talked in a corner with him and

the duke of medina  his ambassador 



 i will sign whatever you choose  constable   said the emperor  who knew

the old campaigner s loyalty   prepare a deed of cession of the duchy of

milan  and by saint james  though it be one of the brightest jewels of

my crown  i will sign an absolute surrender of it to you  



 a deed   cried the constable  hotly putting aside the suggestion of a

precaution which implied distrust   a deed  sire  what is your majesty s

meaning  no deed  sire  no deed  your word  nothing more  does your

majesty think that we shall have less confidence in you than you had in

us  when you came to france with no written document to rely upon  



 you will do as you should do  monsieur de montmorency   rejoined the

emperor  giving him his hand   you will do what you should do  



the constable walked away 



 poor dupe   exclaimed the emperor   he plays at politics  medina  as

moles dig their holes  blindly  



 but the king  sire   queried medina 



 the king is too proud of his own grandeur of soul not to be sure of

ours  he will foolishly let us go  medina  and we will prudently let him

wait  to make him wait  my lord  is not to break my promise  but to

postpone its fulfilment  that is all  



 but madame d etampes   suggested medina 



 as to her we shall see   said the emperor  moving up and down a

magnificent ring with a superb diamond  which he wore on his left thumb 

 ah  i must have a long interview with her  



while these words were rapidly exchanged in low tones between the

emperor and his minister  the duchess was mercilessly making sport of

marmagne  apropos of his nocturnal exploits  all in presence of messire

d estourville 



 can it be of your people  monsieur de marmagne   she was saying   that

benvenuto tells every comer this extraordinary story  attacked by four

bandits  and with but one arm free to defend himself  he simply made

these gentry escort him home  were you one of these gentlemanly bravos 

viscount  



 madame   replied poor marmagne  in confusion   it did not take place

precisely in that way  and benvenuto tells the story too favorably for

himself  



 yes  yes  i doubt not that he embroiders it a little  and adds a few

details by way of ornament  but the main fact is true  viscount  the

main fact is true  and in such matters the main fact is everything  



 madame   returned marmagne   i promise you that i will have my revenge 

and i shall be more fortunate next time  



 pardon  viscount  pardon  it s not a question of revenge  but of

beginning another game  cellini  i should say  has won the first two

bouts  



 yes  thanks to my absence   muttered marmagne  with increasing

embarrassment   because my men took advantage of my not being there to

run away  the miserable villains  



 oh   said the provost   i advise you  marmagne  to admit that you are

beaten in that direction  you have no luck with cellini  



 in that case it seems to me that we may console each other  my dear

provost   retorted marmagne   for if we add known facts to the

mysterious rumors which are in circulation   the capture of the

grand nesle to the reported disappearance of one of its fair

inmates   cellini would seem not to have brought you luck either 

messire d estourville  to be sure  he is said to be actively interested

in the fortunes of your family  if not in your own  my dear provost  



 monsieur de marmagne   cried the provost fiercely  in a furious rage to

learn that his paternal infelicity was beginning to be noised

abroad    monsieur de marmagne  you will explain to me later what you

mean by your words  



 ah messieurs  messieurs   exclaimed the duchess   do not forget  i beg

you  that i am here  you are both in the wrong  monsieur le prévôt  it

is not for those who know so little about seeking to ridicule those who

know so little about finding  monsieur de marmagne  in the hour of

defeat we must unite against the common enemy  and not afford him the

additional satisfaction of seeing the vanquished slashing at one

another s throats  they are going to the  salle à manger   your hand 

monsieur de marmagne  ah  well  since it seems that men  for all their

strength  avail nothing against cellini  we will see if a woman s wiles

will find him equally invincible  i have always thought that allies were

simply in the way  and have always loved to make war alone  the risk is

greater  i know  but at least the honors of victory are not to be shared

with any one  



 the impertinent varlet   exclaimed marmagne   see how familiarly he is

talking to our great king  would not one say he was nobly born  whereas

he is naught but a mere stone cutter  



 what s that you say  viscount  why  he is a nobleman  and of the most

venerable nobility   said the duchess  with a laugh   do you know of

many among our oldest families who descend from a lieutenant of julius

cæsar  and who have the three  fleurs de lis  and the  lambel  of the

house of anjou in their crest   t is not the king who honors the

sculptor by speaking to him  messieurs  as you see  the sculptor  on the

other hand  confers honor upon the king by condescending to address

him  



 françois i  and cellini were in fact conversing at that moment with

the familiarity to which the great ones of earth had accustomed the

chosen artist of heaven 



 well  benvenuto   the king was saying   how do we come on with our

jupiter  



 i am preparing to cast it  sire  



 and when will that great work be performed  



 immediately upon my return to paris  sire  



 take our best foundrymen  cellini  and omit nothing to make the

operation successful  if you need money  you know that i am ready  



 i know that you are the greatest  the noblest  and the most generous

king on earth  sire   replied benvenuto   but thanks to the salary which

your majesty orders paid to me  i am rich  as to the operation

concerning which you are somewhat anxious  sire  i will  with your

gracious permission  rely upon my own resources to prepare and execute

it  i distrust all your french foundrymen  not that they are unskilful 

but because i am afraid that their national pride will make them

disinclined to place their skill at the service of an artist from beyond

the alps  and i confess  sire  that i attach too much importance to the

success of my jupiter to allow any other than myself to lay hand to it  



 bravo  cellini  bravo   cried the king   spoken like a true artist  



 moreover   added benvenuto   i wish to be entitled to remind your

majesty of the promise you made me  



 that is right  my trusty friend  if we are content with it  we are to

grant you a boon  we have not forgotten  indeed  if we should forget  we

bound ourselves in the presence of witnesses  is it not so  montmorency 

and poyet  our constable and our chancellor will remind us of our

plighted word  



 ah  your majesty cannot conceive how precious that word has become to

me since the day it was given  



 very well  it shall be kept  monsieur  but the doors are open  to

table  messieurs  to table  



françois thereupon joined the emperor  and the two together walked at

the head of the procession formed by the illustrious guests  both wings

of the folding doors being thrown open  the two sovereigns entered side

by side and took places facing each other  charles between eleanora and

madame d etampes  françois between catherine de medicis and marguerite

de navarre 



the banquet was exquisite and the guests in the best of spirits 

françois was in his element  and enjoyed himself in kingly fashion  but

laughed like a serf at all the tales told him by marguerite de navarre 

charles overwhelmed madame d etampes with compliments and attentions 

the others talked of art and politics  and so the time passed 





 illustration 06 





at dessert  as was customary  the pages brought water for the guests to

wash their hands  thereupon madame d etampes took the ewer and basin

intended for charles v  from the hands of the servitor  while marguerite

did the same for françois  poured water from the ewer into the basin 

and  kneeling upon one knee  according to the spanish etiquette 

presented the basin to the emperor  he dipped the ends of his fingers 

gazing at his noble and beautiful attendant the while  and laughingly

dropped the superb ring  of which we have spoken  into the water 



 your majesty is losing your ring   said anne  dipping her own taper

fingers into the water  and daintily picking up the jewel  which she

handed to the emperor 



 keep the ring  madame   the emperor replied  in a low voice   the hands

in which it now is are too noble and too beautiful for me to take it

from them again  it is to bind the bargain for the duchy of milan   he

added  in a still lower tone 



the duchess smiled and said no more  the pebble had fallen at her feet 

but the pebble was worth a million 



as they returned from the  salle à manger  to the salon  and passed

thence to the ball room  madame d etampes stopped benvenuto  who was

brought near to her by the press 



 messire cellini   said she  handing him the ring which constituted a

pledge of the alliance between the emperor and herself   here is a

diamond which you will hand  if you please  to your pupil ascanio  for

the crown of my lily  it is the dew drop i promised him  



 and it has fallen from aurora s fingers in very truth  madame  

rejoined the artist with a mocking smile and affected gallantry 



he glanced at the ring  and started back in surprise  for he recognized

the diamond he had long ago set for pope clement vii  and had himself

carried to the sublime emperor on the sovereign pontiff s behalf 



to induce charles v  to divest himself of such a priceless jewel 

especially in favor of a woman  there must necessarily be some secret

understanding  some occult treaty  between himself and the recipient 



while charles continues to pass his days and nights at fontainebleau  in

the alternations of distrust and confidence  we have endeavored to

describe  while he schemes  intrigues  burrows underground  promises 

retracts  and promises anew  let us cast a glance upon the grand nesle 

and see if anything of interest is occurring among those of its

occupants who have remained there 









vii





the ghostly monk





the whole colony was in a state of intense excitement  the ghost of the

monk  the unsubstantial guest of the convent  upon the ruins of which

amaury s palace was built  had returned within three or four days  dame

perrine had seen him walking around at night in the gardens of the

grand nesle  clad in his long white frock  and treading so lightly that

he left no footprints on the ground  and made no noise 



how happened it that dame perrine  whose domicile was the petit nesle 

had seen the ghostly visitor walking in the garden of the grand nesle at

three o clock in the morning  we cannot tell except by committing a very

grave indiscretion  but we are historians first of all  and our readers

are entitled to know the most secret details of the lives of the

characters we have brought upon the stage  especially when those details

are calculated to throw a bright light upon the sequel of our narrative 



dame perrine  by virtue of colombe s disappearance  by the retirement of

pulchérie  for whose presence there was no further pretext  and by the

departure of the provost  was left absolute mistress of the petit nesle 

for the gardener raimbault and his assistants were  for economical

reasons  engaged in messire d estourville s service during the day only 

dame perrine found herself  therefore  queen of the petit nesle  but at

the same time a solitary queen  so that she nearly died of ennui during

the day  and of fear at night 



it occurred to her that there was a remedy for this unfortunate

condition of affairs  during the day at least  her friendly relations

with dame ruperta opened the doors of the grand nesle to her  she asked

permission to visit her neighbors  and it was most cordially granted 



but upon availing herself of this permission dame perrine was naturally

brought in contact with her neighbors of the other sex  dame perrine was

a buxom creature of thirty six years  who confessed to twenty nine of

them  plump and rosy still  and always prepossessing  her coming was

quite an event in the studio  where ten or twelve worthy fellows were

forging  cutting  filing  hammering  chiselling   good livers all  fond

of play on sundays  of wine on sundays and holidays  and of the fair sex

all the time  three of our old acquaintances  after three or four days

had passed  were all brought down with the same arrow 



they were little jehan  simon le gaucher  and hermann the german 



ascanio  jacques aubry  and pagolo escaped the charm  having their minds

on other things 



the other comrades may well have felt some sparks of this greek fire 

but they realized their inferior position  no doubt  and poured the

water of their humility upon the first sparks before they became a

conflagration 



little jehan loved after the manner of cherubino  that is to say  he was

in love with loving  dame perrine  as the reader will readily

understand  had too much common sense to respond to such an  ignis

fatuus  as that 



simon le gaucher could offer more reliable future prospects  and his

flame promised to be more enduring  but dame perrine was a very

superstitious person  she had seen simon cross himself with his left

hand  and she reflected that it would be necessary for him to sign the

marriage contract with his left hand  dame perrine was convinced that

the sign of the cross executed with the left hand was calculated to

destroy rather than to save a soul  and in like manner no one could have

persuaded her that a marriage contract signed with the left hand could

have any other result than an unhappy menage  she therefore  but without

disclosing the reasons for her repugnance  received simon le gaucher s

first advances in a way to make him renounce all hope 



hermann remained  ah  hermann  that was a different matter 



hermann was no coxcomb  like little jehan  nor a man with the seal of

nature s displeasure upon him  like left handed simon  in hermann s

personality there was something honest and outspoken which appealed to

dame perrine s heart  moreover  hermann  instead of having a left hand

for the right and vice versa  made use of either or both so

energetically that he seemed to have two right hands  he was a

magnificent man too  according to all vulgar ideas  dame perrine

therefore had fixed her choice upon hermann 



but  as we know  hermann was as innocent as celadon  the result was that

dame perrine s first broadsides  the pouting and sighs and sidelong

glances  were utterly powerless against the naïve timidity of the

honest german  he contented himself with staring at dame perrine out of

his great round eyes  but  like the blind men of the gospel   eyes had

he  but he saw not   or if he did see  he saw the buxom governess as a

whole simply  without noting details  dame perrine repeatedly proposed

that they should go for a walk on the quai des augustins  or in the

gardens of the grand  or petit nesle  and on every occasion she selected

hermann for her cavalier  this made hermann very happy internally  his

great teutonic heart beat five or six extra pulsations a minute when

dame perrine was hanging upon his arm  but either because he found some

difficulty in pronouncing the french language  or because it gave him

greater pleasure to hear the object of his secret thoughts talk  dame

perrine could rarely extract anything more from him than these two

sacramental phrases   ponchour  matemoizelle   and  atieu 

matemoizelle   which hermann generally pronounced at an interval of two

hours  the first when dame perrine took his arm  the second when she let

it go  now  although this title of mademoiselle was immensely flattering

to dame perrine  and although there was something very agreeable in

talking two hours without fear of interruption  she would have been glad

to have her monologue broken in upon by an occasional interjection which

might give her some idea of the progress she was making in the heart of

her mute attendant 



her progress  however  was none the less real for not being expressed in

words or by play of feature  the fire was kindled in the honest german s

heart  and  being fanned every day by dame perrine s presence  became a

veritable volcano  hermann began at last to be conscious of the

preference dame perrine accorded him  and he was only waiting until he

was a little more certain of it to declare himself  dame perrine

understood his hesitation  one evening  as he parted from her at the

door of the petit nesle  she saw that he was so agitated that she

thought it would be a real kindness on her part to press his hand 

hermann  transported with delight  responded by a similar demonstration 

but to his great amazement dame perrine gave a piercing shriek  in his

delirious bliss  hermann did not measure his pressure  he thought that

the tighter he squeezed her hand  the more accurate idea he would convey

of the violence of his passion  and he very nearly crushed the poor

governess s fingers 



hermann was thunderstruck by her shriek  but dame perrine  fearing to

discourage him just as he had summoned up courage to make his first

advance  forced herself to smile  and said  as she separated her

fingers  which were almost glued together for the moment   



 it s nothing  nothing  dear monsieur hermann  it s nothing  absolutely

nothing  



 tausend pardons  matemoizelle perrine   said the german   but i lofe

you sehr viel  and i haf pressed your hant as i lofe you  tausend

pardons  



 there s no need  monsieur hermann  there s no need  your love is an

honorable love  i trust  which a woman need not blush to win  



 o tieu  o tieu   cried hermann   indeed  my lofe is honorable 

matemoizelle perrine  put i haf not yet tared to speak to you of it  put

since die wort haf escaped me  i lofe you  i lofe you  i lofe you sehr

viel  matemoizelle perrine  



 and i  monsieur hermann   said dame perrine mincingly   think i can

say  for i believe you to be a gallant youth  incapable of compromising

a poor woman  that  mon dieu  how shall i say it  



 oh say it  say it   cried hermann 



 well  that  ah  it is wrong of me to confess it  



 nein  nein  it is not wrong  say it  say it  



 very well  i confess that i am not indifferent to your passion  



 sacrement   cried the german  beside himself with joy 



now one evening when  after a promenade  the juliet of the petit nesle

had escorted her romeo to the door of the grand nesle  she espied as she

was returning alone through the garden door  the white spectre we have

mentioned  which  in the opinion of the worthy governess  could be no

other than that of the monk  it is needless to say that dame perrine

entered the house half dead with fear  and barricaded herself in her

room 



the next morning the whole studio was acquainted with the story of the

nocturnal apparition  dame perrine  however  contented herself with

relating the simple fact without going into details  the ghostly monk

had appeared  that was the whole of it  it was useless to question her 

for she would say nothing more 



all that day the ghostly monk was the engrossing subject of conversation

at the grand nesle  some believed in the appearance of the phantom 

others laughed at it  it was noticed that ascanio was the leader of the

sceptics  the others being little jehan  simon le gaucher  and jacques

aubry  the faction of the believers included dame ruperta  scozzone 

pagolo  and hermann 



in the evening they all assembled in the second courtyard of the

petit nesle  dame perrine  when questioned in the morning as to the

origin of the legend of the ghostly monk  requested that she might have

the day to refresh her memory  and when night came she announced that

she was ready to relate the awful story  dame perrine was as knowing in

the matter of stage effects as a modern dramatist  and she knew that a

ghost story loses all its effect if told in the sunlight  while  on the

other hand  that effect is doubled if it is told in the dark 



her audience consisted of hermann  who sat at her right  dame ruperta 

who sat at her left  pagolo and scozzone  who sat side by side  and

jacques aubry  who lay on the grass between his two friends  little

jehan and simon le gaucher  ascanio had declared that he held such old

women s tales in utter contempt  and would not even listen to them 



 unt zo  matemoizelle perrine   said hermann after a moment of silence 

while each one arranged his posture so as to listen at ease   unt zo you

are going to tell us the story of the monk s ghost  



 yes   said dame perrine   yes  but i ought to warn you that it s a

terrible story  and perhaps not a very comfortable one to listen to at

this hour  but as we are all devout persons  although there may be some

sceptics among us on the subject of ghosts  and as monsieur hermann is

strong enough to put satan himself to flight if he should make his

appearance  i will venture to tell you the story  



 pardon  pardon  matemoizelle perrine  put if satan comes i must tell

you not to count on me  i will fight mit men  ja  all you choose  put

not mit der teufel  



 never mind  i will fight him if he comes  dame perrine   said jacques

aubry   go on  and don t be afraid  



 is there a charcoal purner in your story  matemoizelle perrine  

queried hermann 



 a charcoal burner  no  monsieur hermann  



 all right  it s all the same  



 why a charcoal burner  



 because in all the cherman stories there is a charcoal purner  put

never mind  it must be a fine story all the same  go on  matemoizelle

perrine  



 you must know  then   began dame perrine   that there was formerly on

this spot where we now sit  and before the hôtel de nesle was built  a

community of monks  composed of the handsomest men ever seen  the

shortest of whom was as tall as monsieur hermann  



 peste  what a community that must have been   cried jacques aubry 



 be quiet  babbler   said scozzone 



 yes  be quiet  pappler   echoed hermann 



 i ll be quiet  i ll be quiet   said the student   go on  dame perrine  



 the prior  whose name was enguerrand  was a particularly fine specimen 

they all had glossy black beards  with black and gleaming eyes  but the

prior had the blackest beard and the brightest eyes of all  moreover the

worthy brethren were devout and austere in their devotion to an

unparalleled degree  and their voices were so melodious and sweet that

people came from leagues around simply to hear them sing the vesper

service  at least so i have been told  



 oh the poor monks   said ruperta 



 it s extremely interesting   said jacques aubry 



 es ist sehr wunderbar   said hermann 



 one day   pursued dame perrine  flattered by the marks of appreciation

evoked by her narrative   a handsome young man was brought before the

prior  who requested to be admitted to the convent as a novice  he had

no beard as yet  but he had large eyes as black as ebony  and long dark

hair with a glossy shimmer like jet  so that he was admitted without

hesitation  he said that his name was antonio  and requested to be

attached to the personal service of the prior  a request which was

granted without hesitation  i spoke of voices just now  but antonio s

was the fresh and melodious voice  par excellence   everybody who heard

him sing on the following sunday was carried away by it  and yet there

was a something in the voice which distressed even while it fascinated

you  a quality which aroused worldly rather than celestial ideas in the

hearts of those who listened to it  but all the monks were so pure of

heart that none but strangers experienced this singular emotion  and don

enguerrand  who was utterly unconscious of anything of the sort  was so

enchanted with antonio s voice that he appointed him thenceforth to sing

the responses in the anthems alone  alternately with the organ 



 the conduct of the young novice was most exemplary  and he waited upon

the prior with incredible zeal and earnestness  the only thing for which

he could possibly be reproved was his constant fits of distraction from

his devotions  always and everywhere his glowing eyes were fastened upon

the prior 



  what are you looking at  antonio   don enguerrand would say to him 



  i am looking at you  my father   would be the reply 



  look at your prayer book  antonio  now what are you looking at  



  you  my father  



  antonio  look at the image of the virgin  what are you looking at

now  



  you  my father  



  antonio  look at the crucifix which we adore  



 don enguerrand began to notice  after a time  upon searching his

conscience  that since antonio s reception into the community he had

been more troubled than formerly by evil thoughts  never before had he

sinned more than seven times a day  which  as we all know  is the

reckoning of the saints   sometimes even he had examined his conduct for

the day without being able to find more than five or six sins  an

extraordinary thing  but now the total of his daily peccadillos mounted

as high as ten  twelve  or even fifteen  he would try to make up for it

on the following day  he would pray and fast and scourge himself  would

the worthy man  ah  but the farther he went  the greater became the

reckoning  until at last it reached a full score  poor don enguerrand

knew not which way to turn  he felt that he was damned in spite of all

he could do  and he noticed  an observation which might have comforted

another  but which increased his consternation  that his most austere

monks were under the same strange  incredible  incomprehensible

influence  so that their confession  which formerly lasted twenty

minutes  half an hour  or an hour at most  now occupied several hours 



 about this time  an occurrence which had been creating a great stir in

the province for a month past at last became known at the convent  the

lord of a castle near by had lost his daughter antonia  antonia had

disappeared one fine evening exactly as my poor colombe has disappeared 

but there is this difference  i am sure that colombe is an angel  while

it seems that antonia was possessed of the devil  the poor father had

sought the fugitive high and low  just as monsieur le prévôt has

sought colombe  only the convent remained to be visited  and as he knew

that the evil spirit  the better to elude search  sometimes conceals

himself in monasteries  he sent his chaplain to don enguerrand to ask

permission to make search in his  the prior assented  with the best

possible grace  perhaps  he thought  he might by means of this visit

discover something concerning the magic influence which had been

weighing upon him and his brethren for a month past  but no  the search

had no result whatever  and the nobleman was about to retire more

despairing than ever  when all the monks passed in procession before him

and don enguerrand  on their way to the chapel for the evening service 

he looked at them mechanically  one after another  until the last one

passed  when he cried out   



  god in heaven  that is antonia  that is my daughter  



 antonia  for it was she  became as pale as a lily 



  what are you doing in this sacred garb   continued the father 



  what am i doing  father   said antonia   i am loving don enguerrand

with all my heart  



  leave this convent instantly  wretched girl   cried her father 



  i will go out only as a corpse  father   replied antonia 



 thereupon  despite her father s outcries  she darted into the chapel on

the heels of the monks  and took her place in her accustomed stall  the

prior stood as if turned to stone  the furious nobleman would have

pursued his daughter  but don enguerrand begged him not to profane the

holy place by such a scandalous scene  and to wait until the service was

at an end  the father consented  and followed don enguerrand into the

chapel 



 the anthem was about to be chanted  and the majestic prelude upon the

organ was like the voice of god  a wonderfully beautiful strain  but

instinct with bitter irony  and awful to bear  responded to the sublime

tones of the instrument  it was antonia s voice  and every listening

heart shuddered  the organ took up the chant  calm  grave  impressive 

and seemed as if it were seeking to drown with its divine magnificence

the bitter strains which insulted it from the stalls  again  as if in

acceptance of the challenge  antonia s voice arose more wildly

despairing  more impious  than before  everybody awaited in speechless

dismay the result of this awful dialogue  this alternation of blasphemy

and prayer  this strange conflict between god and satan  and it was amid

the most intense and agonizing silence that the celestial music burst

forth like a peal of thunder  when the blasphemous strain died away  and

poured out upon the heads of the listeners  all bowed save one  the

torrents of its wrath  it was something like the dread voice which the

guilty will hear on the judgment day  antonia tried to keep up the

contest  but her song this time was nothing more than a shrill 

heart rending cry  like the laugh fit the damned  and she fell pale and

stiff upon the pavement of the chapel  when they raised her  she was

dead  



 jésus maria   cried dame ruperta 



 poor antonia   said hermann innocently 



 little fool   muttered jacques aubry 



the others kept silence  so great was the impression produced even upon

the sceptics by dame perrine s narrative  but scozzone wiped away a

tear  and pagolo crossed himself 



 when the prior   resumed dame perrine   saw the devil s messenger thus

crushed by the wrath of god  he believed  poor dear man  that he was

forever delivered from the snares of the tempter  but he reckoned

without his host  a very appropriate expression  as he had been so

imprudent as to extend his hospitality to one possessed of the devil  on

the following night  just after he had dropped off to sleep  he was

awakened by the clanking of chains  he opened his eyes  instinctively

turned them toward the door  and saw that it swung open unaided  and at

the same time a phantom clad in the white robe of a novice drew near the

bed  took him by the arm  and cried   i am antonia  antonia  who loves

thee  and god has given me full power over thee because thou hast

sinned  in thought if not in act   and every night at midnight the

terrible apparition returned  implacably true to its word  until at last

don enguerrand made a pilgrimage to the holy land  and died  by the

special favor of god  just as he knelt before the holy sepulchre 



 but antonia was not satisfied  she fell back upon all the monks in

general  and  as there were very few who had not sinned as deeply as the

poor prior  she visited them all one after another during the night 

roughly awaking them  and crying in an awe inspiring voice   i am

antonia  i am antonia  who loves thee  



 hence the name of the ghostly monk 



 when you are walking through the streets at night  and a figure with a

gray or white hood dogs your steps  hasten home  it is the ghostly monk

in quest of prey 



 when the convent was demolished to make room for the château  they

hoped to be rid of the spectre  but it seems that he is fond of the

spot  at various times he has reappeared  and now  god forgive us our

sins  the unhappy wretch has appeared again  may god preserve us from

his wicked designs  



 amen   said dame ruperta  crossing herself 



 amen   said hermann  with a shudder 



 amen   said jacques aubry  laughing 



and each of the others repeated the word with an inflection

corresponding to the impression produced upon him 









viii





what one sees at night from the top of a

poplar





on the following day  which was that on which the whole court was to

return from fontainebleau  it was dame ruperta s turn to announce to the

same auditory that she had a momentous revelation to make 



as may be imagined  after such an interesting announcement  the whole

party assembled once more in the same spot at the same hour 



they were entirely at their ease  because benvenuto had written to

ascanio that he should stay behind for two or three days to prepare the

hall where his jupiter was to be displayed  which jupiter was to be cast

immediately upon his return 



the provost had simply made his appearance at the hôtel de nesle to ask

if there was any news of colombe  but upon being informed by dame

perrine that everything was  in statu quo   he at once returned to the

châtelet 



the occupants of the grand and petit nesle enjoyed entire freedom of

action  therefore  both masters being absent 



in the ease of jacques aubry  although he was to have met gervaise that

evening  curiosity carried the day over love  or rather he hoped that

dame ruperta would be less diffuse than dame perrine  and that she would

have finished so early that he might hear her story and still keep his

appointment 



this is what ruperta had to tell 



dame perrine s narrative ran in her head all night long  and from the

moment that she entered her bedroom she trembled in every limb lest

antonia s spirit should pay her a visit  notwithstanding the blessed

relics which hung about her bed 



she barricaded her door  but that was a very inadequate precaution  the

old servant was too well versed in the ways of phantoms not to be aware

that they know nothing of closed doors  nevertheless she would have

liked also to barricade the window looking upon the garden of the

grand nesle  but the original proprietor had neglected to provide the

window with shutters  and the present proprietor deemed it useless to

burden himself with that expense 



ordinarily there were curtains at the window  but at this time  as luck

would have it  they were at the laundry  the window offered no

protection  therefore  save an unpretentious pane of glass  as

transparent as the air that it excluded 



on entering the room ruperta looked under the bed  felt in all the

drawers and closets  and did not leave a single corner uninspected  she

knew that the devil occupies but little space when he draws in his tail

and claws and horns  and that asmodeus was corked up in a bottle for

nobody knows how many years 



the room was entirely untenanted  and there was not the slightest trace

of the ghostly monk 



ruperta went to bed therefore somewhat more at ease  but she left her

lamp burning none the less  she was no sooner in bed than she looked

toward the window  and saw outside the window a gigantic figure  whose

outlines were just discernible in the darkness  and which intercepted

the light of the stars  the moon was invisible as it was in its last

quarter 



good ruperta shivered with fear  she was on the point of crying out or

knocking  when she remembered the colossal statue of mars which reared

its head before her window  she immediately looked again in that

direction  and recognized perfectly all the outlines of the god of war 

this reassured ruperta for the moment  and she determined positively to

go to sleep 



but sleep  the poor man s treasure so often coveted by the rich  is at

no man s orders  at night god opens heaven s gates for him  and the

capricious rascal visits whom he pleases  turning aside disdainfully

from him who calls  and knocking at their doors who least expect him 

ruperta invoked him long before he paid heed to her 



at last  toward midnight  fatigue won the day  little by little  the

good woman s faculties became confused  her thoughts which were in

general but ill connected  broke the imperceptible thread which held

them  and scattered like the beads of a rosary  her heart alone 

distraught by fear  was still awake  at last it too fell fast asleep 

and all was said  the lamp alone kept vigil 



but  like all things of earth  the lamp found rest two hours after

ruperta had closed her eyes in the sleep of the just  upon the pretext

that it had no oil to burn  it began to grow dim  sputtered  blazed up

for an instant  and then died 



just at that time ruperta had a fearful dream  she dreamed that  as she

was returning home from visiting perrine  the ghostly monk pursued her 

but happily  against all precedents of those who dream  ruperta to her

joy found that she had the legs of fifteen years  and fled so swiftly

that the ghostly monk  although he seemed to glide and not to run over

the ground  only arrived in time to have the door slammed in his face 

ruperta thought  still dreaming  that she heard him snarl and pound upon

the door  but  as may be imagined  she was in no haste to let him in 

she lit her lamp  ran up the stairs four at a time  jumped into bed  and

put out the light 



but  just as she put out the light  she saw the monk s head outside her

window  he had crawled up the wall like a lizard  and was trying to come

through the glass  in her dream  she heard the grinding of his nails

against it 



he sleep can be so sound as to hold out against a dream of that sort 

ruperta awoke with her hair standing on end  and dripping with icy

perspiration  her eyes were open  staring wildly around  and in spite of

her they sought the window  with that she uttered a fearful shriek  for

this is what she saw 



she saw the head of the colossal mars shooting forth flame from its eyes

and nose and mouth and ears 



she thought at first that she was still asleep  and that it was a

continuation of her dream  but she pinched herself till the blood came

to make sure that she was really awake  she crossed herself  and

repeated mentally three  paters  and two  aves   and the extraordinary

phenomena did not disappear 



ruperta summoned strength enough to put out her hand  seize her broom 

and pound against the ceiling with the handle thereof  hermann slept in

the room above hers  and she hoped that the sturdy teuton would be

aroused and hurry to her assistance  but in vain did ruperta knock 

hermann gave no sign of life 



thereupon she changed the direction of her blows  and  instead of

knocking on the ceiling to arouse hermann  began to knock on the floor

to arouse pagolo  who slept in the room below 



but pagolo was as deaf as hermann  and ruperta pounded to no purpose 



she then abandoned the vertical for the horizontal line  ascanio was her

neighbor  and she knocked on the partition with her broom handle 



but all was silence in ascanio s quarters  as in those of hermann and

pagolo  it was evident that neither of the three was at home  in an

instant it occurred to ruperta that the monk had carried off all three

of them 



as there was little consolation in this idea  ruperta s terror waxed

greater and greater  and  as she was certain that no one would come to

her assistance  she thrust her head beneath the bedclothes and waited 



she waited an hour  an hour and a half  two hours perhaps  and as she

heard no noise  she regained her courage in a measure  softly removed

the sheet from her head  and ventured to look with one eye  then with

both  the vision had disappeared  the head of mars had gone out  and all

was dark once more 



although the silence and darkness were calculated to set her mind at

rest  it will readily be understood that dame ruperta and slumber were

at odds for the balance of the night  the poor woman lay  with her ear

on the alert and both eyes wide open  until the first rays of dawn

reflected on her window announced that the time for ghosts to walk had

passed 



now this is what ruperta had to tell  and it must be said in her honor

that her narrative produced an even deeper impression than that of the

preceding night  its effect upon dame perrine and hermann  scozzone and

pagolo  was particularly noticeable  the two men essayed to make excuses

for not hearing ruperta  but their voices trembled so  and their

embarrassment was so great  that jacques aubry roared with laughter 

dame perrine and scozzone  on the other hand  did not breathe a word 

they turned red and pale by turns  so that  if it had been daylight and

you could have followed upon their faces the reflection of what was

taking place in their minds  you would have believed them at the point

of death from apoplexy  and again from inanition  all within ten

seconds 



 and so  dame perrrine   said scozzone  who was the first to recover her

self possession   you claim to have seen the monk s ghost walking in the

garden of the grand nesle  



 as plainly as i see you  my child   was dame perrrine s reply 



 and you  ruperta  saw the head of the mars on fire  



 i can see it still  



 look you   said dame perrine   the accursed ghost must have chosen the

head of the statue for his domicile  and as a ghost must of course take

a little exercise now and then like a natural being  he comes down at

certain hours  walks hither and thither  and when he s tired goes back

into the head  idols and spirits  you see  understand one another  like

thieves on market day  they live in hell together  and this horrible

false god mars naturally enough offers his hospitality to the infernal

monk  



 pelieve you zo  dame perrine   queried the innocent german 



 i am sure of it  monsieur hermann  sure of it  



 it makes my flesh to greep  on my vord   muttered hermann with a

shudder 



 so you believe in ghosts  hermann   asked aubry 



 ja  i do pelieve in tem  



jacques aubry shrugged his shoulders  but as he did so he determined to

solve the mystery  it was the easiest thing in the world for one who 

like himself  went in and out of the house as familiarly as if he were

one of the family  he made up his mind  therefore  that he would go and

see gervaise the next day  but that on this evening he would remain at

the grand nesle until ten o clock  at ten o clock he would say good

night to everybody and pretend to go away  but that he would remain

within the precincts  climb a poplar  and make the acquaintance of the

phantom from a hiding place among the branches 



everything fell out as the student planned  he left the studio alone as

usual  shut the door leading into the quay with a great noise to

indicate that he had gone out  then ran rapidly to the foot of the

poplar  seized the lowest branch  drew himself up to it by his wrists 

and in an instant was at the top of the tree  there he was just on a

level with the head of the statue  and overlooked both the grand and

petit nesle  so that nothing could take place in the courtyard or garden

of either unseen by him 



while jacques aubry was taking up his position on his lofty perch  a

grand soirée was in progress at the louvre  and all the windows were

ablaze with light  charles v  had finally decided to leave

fontainebleau  and venture within the walls of the capital  and the two

sovereigns had entered paris that same evening 



a gorgeous welcoming fête awaited the emperor there  there was a

banquet  gaming  and a ball  gondolas lighted by colored lanterns glided

up and down the seine  laden with musicians  and made melodious pauses

in front of the famous balcony  from which  thirty years later  charles

ix  was to fire upon his people  while boats gayly decked with flowers

conveyed from one bank of the river to the other those guests who were

on their way from the faubourg saint germain to the louvre  or who were

returning to the faubourg saint germain 



among the guests the vicomte de marmagne was naturally included 



as we have said  the vicomte de marmagne  a tall  pink cheeked  insipid

dandy  claimed to be a great destroyer of hearts  on this occasion he

thought that a certain pretty little countess  whose husband happened to

be with the army in savoy  cast meaning glances at him  thereupon he

danced with her  and fancied that her hand was not insensible to the

pressure he ventured to bestow upon it  and so  when he saw the fair

object of his thoughts leave the ball room  he imagined  from the glance

she gave him as she departed  that  like galatea  she was flying toward

the willows in the hope of being pursued  marmagne therefore set out in

pursuit  and as she lived in the vicinity of rue hautefeuille his course

lay from the louvre to the tour de nesle  and thence along the quay and

through rue des grands augustins to rue saint andré  he was walking

along the quay when he heard steps behind him 



it was about one o clock in the morning  the moon  as we have said  was

entering her last quarter  so that the night was quite dark  among the

rare moral qualities with which nature had endowed marmagne  courage did

not hold a prominent position  he began therefore after a while to be

somewhat disturbed by these footsteps  which seemed to be following his

own  and quickened his gait  wrapping himself more closely than ever in

his cloak  and instinctively grasping the hilt of his sword 



but the acceleration of speed profited him not  the steps behind

governed themselves by his  and even seemed to gain upon him  so that 

just as he passed the doorway of the church of the augustins he realized

that he should very soon be overtaken by his fellow traveller unless he

quickened his pace still more to a racing speed  he was just about to

adopt that extreme course when the sound of a voice mingled with the

sound of the footsteps 



 pardieu  my fine sir  you do well to walk fast   said the voice   for

this isn t a very safe place  especially at this hour  right here  you

know of course  is where my worthy friend benvenuto was

attacked   benvenuto  the sublime artist  who is at fontainebleau at

this moment  and has no suspicion of what is going on under his roof 

but as we are going in the same direction apparently  we can walk along

together  and if we meet any cut throats they will look twice before

they attack us  i offer you therefore the safeguard of my companionship 

if you will give me the honor of yours  



at the first word our student uttered  marmagne knew that it was the

voice of one who wished him no ill  and at the name of benvenuto he

remembered and recognized the garrulous law student  who had on a

previous occasion given him so much useful information concerning the

interior of the grand nesle  he at once halted  and waited for master

jacques aubry to come up  for his society would be of advantage to him

in two ways  in the first place  he would serve as a sort of body guard 

and might in the mean while give him some fresh information concerning

his enemy  which his hatred would enable him to turn to advantage  he

therefore welcomed the student with his most agreeable manner 



 good evening  my young friend   he said  in reply to the familiar

harangue addressed to him by jacques aubry in the darkness   what were

you saying of our good benvenuto  whom i hoped to meet at the louvre 

but who has remained at fontainebleau  like the fox that he is  



 well  by my soul  here s luck   cried jacques aubry   what  is it you 

my dear vicomte  de  you forgot to tell me your name  or i forgot to

remember it  you come from the louvre  was it very lovely  very lively 

with love making galore  we are in good luck  my gentleman  aren t we  o

you heart breaker  



 faith   said marmagne with a simper   you re a sorcerer  my dear

fellow  yes  i come from the louvre  where the king said some very

gracious things to me  and where i should still he if a certain

fascinating little countess had not signified to me that she preferred a

solitude  à deux  to all that crush  but whence come you  



 whence come i   rejoined aubry  with a hearty laugh   faith  you remind

me  poor benvenuto  on my word  he doesn t deserve it  



 pray what has happened to our dear friend  



 in the first place  you must know that i come from the grand nesle 

where i have passed two hours clinging to the branch of a tree like any

parrot  



 the devil  that was no very comfortable position  



 never mind  never mind  i don t regret the cramp i got there  for i saw

things  my friend  i saw things  why  simply in thinking of them i

suffocate with laughter  



as he spoke jacques aubry did laugh  so joyously and frankly that 

although marmagne had as yet no idea what he was laughing at  he could

not forbear joining in the chorus  but his ignorance of the cause of the

student s amusement naturally made him the first to cease 



 now  my young friend  that i have been drawn on by your hilarity to

laugh in confidence   said marmagne   may i not know what wonderful

things they were to amuse you so  you know that i am one of benvenuto s

faithful friends  although i have never met you at his house  as my

occupation leaves me very little time to devote to society  and that

little i prefer to devote to my mistresses rather than my friends  i

confess  but it is none the less true that whatever affects him affects

me  dear benvenuto  tell me what is going on at the grand nesle in his

absence  that interests me more than i can explain to you  



 what is going on   said aubry   no  no  that s a secret  



 a secret to me   said marmagne   a secret to me  who love benvenuto so

dearly  and who this very evening outdid king françois i  in eulogizing

him  ah  that is too bad   added the viscount  with an injured

expression 



 if i were only sure that you would mention it to nobody  my dear  what

the devil is your name  my dear friend   i would tell you about it  for

i confess that i am as anxious to tell my story as king midas s reeds

were to tell theirs  



 tell it then  tell it   said marmagne 



 you won t repeat it to anybody  



 to nobody  i swear  



 on your word of honor  



 on the faith of a nobleman  



 fancy then  but  in the first place  my dear friend  you know the

story of the monk s ghost  don t you  



 yes  i ve heard of it  a phantom that is said to haunt the

grand nesle  



 just so  well  well  if you know that  i can tell you the rest  fancy

that dame perrine   



 colombe s governess  



 just so  well  well  it s easy to see that you re a friend of the

family  fancy then that dame perrine  in a nocturnal walk which she was

taking for her health  thought that she saw the ghostly monk also taking

a walk in the garden of the grand nesle  while at the same time dame

ruperta  you know dame ruperta  



 isn t she cellini s old servant  



 just so  while dame ruperta  during one of her fits of sleeplessness 

saw flames darting from the eyes  nose  and mouth of the great statue of

mars which you have seen in the gardens of the grand nesle  



 yes  a veritable  chef d œuvre    said marmagne 



  chef d œuvre  is the word  cellini makes nothing else  flow  these

two respectable ladies  i speak of dame perrine and dame ruperta  agreed

between themselves that the two apparitions had the same cause  and that

the demon  who stalked abroad at night in the guise of the ghostly monk 

ascended at cock crow into the head of the god mars  a fitting retreat

for a lost soul like him  and was there consumed by such fierce flames

that they came out through the statue s eyes  nose  and ears  



 what sort of a fairy tale is this  my dear man   said marmagne  unable

to tell whether the student was joking or talking seriously 



 the tale of a ghost  my friend  nothing more nor less  



 can it be that an intelligent fellow like you believes in such stuff  



 why no  i don t believe in it   said jacques aubry   that is just why i

concluded to pass the night in a poplar tree to clear up the mystery 

and find out who the demon really is who is upsetting the whole

household  so i pretended to come out  but instead of closing the door

of the grand nesle behind me i closed it in front of me  glided back in

the darkness without being seen  and got safely to the poplar upon which

i had my eye  five minutes later i was snugly ensconced among the

branches on a level with mars s head  now guess what i saw  



 how can i guess  pray  



 to be sure  one must be a sorcerer to guess such things  in the first

place i saw the great door open  the door at the top of the steps  you

know  



 yes  yes  i know it   said marmagne 



 i saw the door open and a man put his nose out to see if there was any

one in the courtyard  it was hermann  the fat german  



 yes  hermann  the fat german   echoed marmagne 



 when he was fully assured that the courtyard was deserted  having

looked about everywhere  except in the tree  where  as you can imagine 

he was very far from suspecting my presence  he came out  closed the

door behind him  descended the five or six steps  and went straight to

the door of the petit nesle  where he knocked three times  at that

signal a woman came out of the petit nesle and opened the door  this

woman was our friend dame perrine  who apparently has a weakness for

walking about at night with our goliath  



 no  really  oh the poor provost  



 wait a moment  wait  that s not all  i was looking after them as they

went into the petit nesle  when suddenly i heard the grating of a

window sash at my left  i turned  the window opened and out came

pagolo   that brigand of a pagolo   who would have believed it of him

with all his protestations  and his paters and aves   out came pagolo 

and  after looking about as cautiously as hermann  straddled the

windowsill  slid down the gutter  and went from balcony to balcony until

he reached the window  guess of whose room  viscount  



 how can i tell  was it dame ruperta s  



 oh no  scozzone s  nothing less  scozzone  benvenuto s beloved

model   a lovely brunette  my word for it  can you believe it of the

rascal  viscount  



 indeed  it s most diverting   said marmagne   is that all you saw  



 wait a bit  wait a bit  my dear fellow  i have kept the best till the

last  the best morsel for the  bonne bouche   wait a bit  we aren t

there yet  but we soon shall be  never fear  



 i am listening   said marmagne   on my honor  my dear fellow  it couldn t

be more diverting  



 wait a bit  i say  wait a bit  i was watching my pagolo running from

balcony to balcony at the risk of breaking his neck  when i heard

another noise  which came almost from the foot of the tree in which i

was sitting  i looked down and saw ascanio creeping stealthily along

from the foundry  



 ascanio  benvenuto s beloved pupil  



 himself  my friend  himself  a sort of choir boy  to whom one would

give absolution without confession  oh yes  that comes of trusting to

appearances  



 why had ascanio come out  



 ah  that s just it  why had he  that s what i asked myself at first 

but soon i had no occasion to ask it  for ascanio  after having made

sure  as hermann and pagolo had done  that nobody could see him  took

from the foundry a long ladder  which he rested against the shoulders of

mars  and up he climbed  as the ladder was on the opposite side from

myself  i lost sight of him as he went up  and was just wondering what

had become of him when i saw a light in the eyes of the statue  



 what s that you say   cried marmagne 



 the exact truth  my friend  and i confess that  if it had happened

without any knowledge on my part of what had happened previously  i

should not have been altogether at my ease  but i had seen ascanio

disappear  and i suspected that the light was caused by him  



 but what was ascanio doing at that hour in the head of the god mars  



 ah  that is just the question i asked myself  and as there was no one

to answer me i determined to find out for myself  i gazed with all my

eyes  and succeeded in discovering  through those of the statue  a

ghost  i  faith  yes  dressed all in white  the ghost of a woman  at

whose feet ascanio was kneeling as respectfully as before a madonna 

unfortunately  the madonna s back was turned to me  and i could not see

her face  but i saw her neck  oh what lovely necks ghosts have  my dear

viscount  imagine a perfect swan s neck  white as snow  and ascanio was

gazing at it  the impious varlet  with a degree of adoration which

convinced me that the ghost was a woman  what do you say to that  my

dear fellow  gad  it s a neat trick  eh  to conceal one s mistress in

the head of a statue  



 yes  yes  it s most ingenious   rejoined marmagne  laughing and

reflecting at the same time   very ingenious  in good sooth  and you

have no suspicion who the woman can be  



 upon my honor  i have no idea  and you  



 no more than you  what did you do  pray  when you saw all this  



 what did i do  i laughed so that i lost my balance  and if i hadn t

caught on a branch i should have broken my neck  as there was nothing

more to see  and i had fallen half way to the ground  i climbed down the

rest of the way  crept to the door  and was on my way home  still

laughing all by myself  when i met you  and you compelled me to tell you

the story  now  give me your advice  as you are of benvenuto s friends 

what must i do about telling him  as for dame perrine  that doesn t

concern him  the dear woman is of age  and consequently mistress of her

actions  but as to scozzone  and the venus who lodges in the head of

mars  it s a different matter  



 and you want me to advise you as to what you ought to do  



 yes  i do indeed  i am much perplexed  my dear  my dear  i always

forget your name  



 my advice is to say nothing to him  so much the worse for those who are

foolish enough to allow themselves to be deceived  i am obliged to you 

master jacques aubry  for your company and your agreeable conversation 

but here we are at rue hautefeuille  and to return confidence for

confidence  this is where my charmer dwells  



 adieu  my dear  my excellent friend   said jacques aubry  pressing the

viscount s hand   your advice is good and i will follow it  good luck 

and may cupid watch over you  



thereupon they parted  marmagne taking rue hautefeuille  and jacques

aubry rue poupée  on his way to rue de la harpe  at the far end of

which he had taken up his abode 



the viscount lied to the unlucky student when he declared that he had no

suspicion as to the identity of the female demon whom ascanio adored on

his knees  his first thought was that the inhabitant of mars was no

other than colombe  and the more he reflected upon it  the more firmly

convinced he became  as we have said  marmagne was equally ill disposed

toward the provost  d orbec  and cellini  and he found himself in a very

awkward position as regarded the gratification of his ill will  for he

could not inflict suffering upon one without giving pleasure to the

others  if he held his peace  d orbec and the provost would remain in

their present embarrassed plight  but benvenuto would likewise continue

in his present joyous frame of mind  if  on the other hand  he disclosed

what he had learned  benvenuto would be in despair  but the provost

would recover his child  d orbec his betrothed  he determined 

therefore  to turn the thing over in his mind until it should be made

clear to him what was the most advantageous course for him to follow 



his indecision did not long endure  without knowing the real motive for

her interest  he was aware that madame d etampes was deeply interested

in the marriage of comte d orbec with colombe  he thought that  by

revealing his secret to the duchess  he might gain sufficient credit for

perspicacity to make up for what he had lost in the matter of courage 

he resolved  therefore  to appear at her morning reception on the

following day  and tell her everything  having formed that resolution 

he punctually put it in execution 



by one of those fortunate chances which sometimes serve the purpose of

evil deeds so well  all the courtiers were at the louvre  paying court

to françois i  and the emperor  and there was nobody at madame

d etampes s reception save her two faithful servants  the provost and

comte d orbec  when the vicomte de marmagne was announced 



the viscount respectfully saluted the duchess  who acknowledged his

salutation with one of those smiles which belonged to her alone  and in

which she could express pride  condescension  and disdain all at the

same time  but marmagne did not worry about this smile  with which he

was well acquainted from having seen it upon the duchess s lips not only

for his own benefit  but for the benefit of many another  he knew

moreover that he possessed a certain means of transforming that smile of

contempt into a smile of good will by a single word 



 aha  messire d estourville   he said  turning to the provost   so the

prodigal child has returned  



 still the same pleasantry  viscount   cried messire d estourville with

a threatening gesture  and flushing with anger 



 oh don t lose your temper  my good friend  don t lose your temper  

returned marmagne   i tell you this  because  if you haven t yet found

your vanished dove  i know where she has built her nest  



 you do   cried the duchess  in the most charmingly friendly way 

 where is it  pray  tell me quickly  i beg  my dear marmagne  



 in the head of the statue of mars  which benvenuto has modelled in the

garden of the grand nesle  









ix





mars and venus





the reader will doubtless have guessed the truth  no less accurately

than marmagne  strange as it may have appeared at first glance  the head

of the colossus was colombe s place of retreat  mars furnished

apartments for venus  as jacques aubry said  for the second time

benvenuto gave his handiwork a part to play in his life  summoned the

artist to the assistance of the man  and embodied his fate in his

statues as well as his thought and his genius  he had on an earlier

occasion concealed his means of escape in one of his figures  he was now

concealing colombe s freedom and ascanio s happiness in another 



but  having reached this point in our narrative  it becomes necessary

for greater clearness to retrace our steps a moment 



when cellini finished the story of stefana  there was a brief pause 

benvenuto saw  among the phantoms which stood out vividly in his

painful  obtrusive memories of the past  the melancholy  but serene

features of stefana  twenty years dead  ascanio  with head bent forward 

was trying to recall the pale face of the woman who had leaned over his

cradle and often awoke him in his infancy  while the tears fell from her

sad eyes upon his chubby cheeks  colombe was gazing with deep emotion at

benvenuto  whom another woman  young and pure like herself  had loved so

dearly  at that moment his voice seemed to her almost as soft as

ascanio s  and between the two  both of whom loved her devotedly  she

felt instinctively that she was as safe as a child could be upon its

mother s knee 



benvenuto was the first to break the silence 



 well   he said   will colombe trust herself to the man to whom stefana

intrusted ascanio  



 you are my father  he my brother   replied colombe  giving a hand to

each of them with modest grace and dignity   and i place myself blindly

in your hands to keep me for my husband  



 thanks   said ascanio   thanks  my beloved  for your trust in him  



 you promise to obey me in everything  colombe   said benvenuto 



 in everything  



 then listen  my children  i have always been convinced that man could

do what he would  but only with the assistance of god on high and time

here below  to save you from comte d orbec and infamy  and to give you

to my ascanio  i must have time  colombe  and in a very few days you are

to be the count s wife  first of all then the essential thing is to

delay this unholy union  is it not  colombe  my sister  my child  my

daughter  there are times in this sad life when it is necessary to do

wrong in order to prevent a crime  will you be courageous and resolute 

will your love  which is so pure and devoted  be brave and strong as

well  tell me  



 ascanio will answer for me   said colombe  with a smile  turning to the

youth   it is his right to dispose of me  



 have no fear  master  colombe will be brave   said ascanio 



 in that case  colombe  will you  trusting in our loyalty and your own

innocence  boldly leave this house and go with us  



ascanio started in surprise  colombe looked at them both for a moment

without speaking  then rose to her feet  and said simply   



 where am i to go  



 o colombe  colombe   cried benvenuto  deeply moved by such absolute

trust   you are a noble  saintly creature  and yet stefana made me very

exacting in my ideal  everything depended upon your reply  we are saved

now  but there isn t a moment to lose  this is the decisive hour  god

places it at our disposal  let us avail ourselves of it  give me your

hand  colombe  and follow me  



the maiden lowered her veil as if to hide her blush from itself  then

followed the master and ascanio  the door between the grand and

petit nesle was locked  but the key was in the lock  benvenuto opened it

noiselessly 



when they were passing through  colombe stopped 



 wait a moment   she said in a voice trembling with emotion  and upon

the threshold of the house which she was leaving because it had ceased

to be a sanctuary for her  the child knelt and prayed  her prayer

remained a secret between god and herself  but doubtless she prayed that

he would forgive her father for what she was driven to do  then she

rose  calm and strong  and went on under the guidance of cellini 

ascanio with troubled heart followed them in silence  gazing fondly at

the white dress which fled before him in the shadow  they walked in

this way across the garden of the grand nesle  the songs and heedless 

joyous laughter of the workmen at their supper  for it will be

remembered that it was a holiday at the château  reached the ears of

our friends  who were anxious and nervous as people ordinarily are at

supreme moments 



when they reached the foot of the statue  benvenuto left colombe a

moment  went to the foundry  and reappeared  laden with a long ladder

which he leaned against the colossus  the moon  the celestial watcher 

east her pale light upon the scene  having made sure that the ladder was

firmly fixed in its place  the master knelt upon one knee in front of

colombe  the most touching respect softened the sternness of his

expression 



 my child   said he   put your arms around me  and hold fast  



colombe obeyed without a word  and benvenuto lifted her as if she had

been a feather 



 the brother   he said to ascanio as he drew near   must allow the

father to carry his beloved daughter  



the powerful goldsmith  laden with the most precious of all burdens 

started up the ladder as lightly as if he were carrying nothing heavier

than a bird  as her head lay upon the master s shoulder  colombe could

watch his manly  good humored faee  and felt a degree of filial trust in

him which was unlike anything she had ever experienced  as to cellini 

so powerful was the will of this man of iron  that he was able to hold

her in his arms  for whom he would have given his life two hours

earlier  with a hand that did not tremble  nor did his heart heat more

rapidly or a single one of his muscles of steel weaken for an instant 

he had ordered his heart to be calm  and his heart had obeyed 



when he reached the neck of the statue he opened a small door  entered

the head  and deposited colombe therein 



the interior of this colossal head of a statue nearly sixty feet high

formed a small round room some eight feet in diameter  and ten feet

high  air and light made their way in through the openings for the eyes 

nose  mouth  and ears  this miniature apartment benvenuto made when he

was working at the head  he used it as a receptacle for the tools he was

using  so that he need not be at the trouble of taking them up and down

five or six times a day  often too he carried up his lunch with him and

set it out upon a table which stood in the centre of this unique

dining room  so that he had not to leave his scaffolding to take his

morning meal  this innovation which was so convenient for him  made the

place attractive to him  he followed up the table with a cot bed  and

latterly he had formed the habit of taking his noon day siesta in the

head of his mars  as well as of breakfasting there  it was quite

natural  therefore  that it should occur to him to ensconce colombe in

what was clearly the most secure hiding place of all he could offer her 



 this is where you must remain  colombe   said benvenuto   and you must

make up your mind to go down only after dark  await here in this

retreat  under god s eye and our watchful care  the result of my

efforts  jupiter   he added with a smile  alluding to the king s

promise   will finish  i trust  what mars has begun  you don t

understand  but i know what i mean  we have olympus on our side  and you

have paradise  how can we not succeed  come  smile a little  colombe 

for the future at least  if not for the present  i tell you in all

seriousness that we have ground for hope  hope therefore with

confidence   in god  if not in me  i have been in a sterner prison than

yours  believe me  and my hope made me indifferent to my captivity  from

now until the day that success crowns my efforts  colombe  you will see

me no more  your brother ascanio  who is less suspected and less closely

watched than i am  will come to see you  and will stand guard over you 

i rely upon him to transform this workman s chamber into a nun s cell 

now that i am about to leave you  mark well and remember my words  you

have done all that you had to do  trustful and courageous child  the

rest concerns me  we have now only to allow providence time to do its

part  colombe  now listen  whatever happens remember this  however

desperate your situation may seem to be or may really be  even though

you stand at the altar and have naught left to say but the terrible yes

which would unite you forever to comte d orbec  do not doubt your

friend  colombe  do not doubt your father  my child  rely upon god and

upon us  i will arrive in time  i promise you  will you have the

requisite faith and resolution  tell me  



 yes   said the girl confidently 



  tis well   said cellini   adieu  i leave you now in your solitude 

when everybody is asleep  ascanio will come and bring you what you need 

adieu  colombe  



he held out his hand  but colombe gave him her forehead to kiss as she

was accustomed to do with her father  benvenuto started  but  passing

his hand over his eyes  he mastered the thoughts which came to his mind

and the passions which raged in his heart  and deposited upon that

spotless forehead the most paternal of kisses 



 adieu  dear child of stefana   he whispered  and went quickly down the

ladder to ascanio  with whom he joined the workmen  who had finished

eating  but were drinking still 



a new life  a strange  dream like life  thereupon began for colombe  and

she accommodated herself to it as she would have done to the life of a

queen 



let us see how the aerial chamber was furnished  it had already  as we

know  a bed and a table  ascanio added a low velvet chair  a venetian

mirror  a collection of religious books selected by colombe herself  a

crucifix   a marvellous piece of carving   and a silver vase  also from

the master s hand  which was filled every night with fresh flowers 

there was room for nothing more in the white shell  which contained so

much of innocence and charm 



colombe ordinarily slept during the day  ascanio had advised that course

for fear that  if she were awake  she might thoughtlessly do something

that would betray her presence  she awoke with the stars and the

nightingale s song  knelt upon her bed  in front of her crucifix  and

remained for some time absorbed in fervent prayer  then she made her

toilet  dressed her lovely  luxuriant hair  and sat and mused  erelong a

ladder would be placed against the statue and ascanio would knock at the

little door  if colombe s toilet was completed  she would admit him and

he would remain with her until midnight  at midnight  if the weather was

fine  she would go down into the garden  and ascanio would return to the

grand nesle for a few hours  sleep  while colombe took her nightly walk 

beginning once more the old dreams she used to dream in her favorite

path  and which seemed now more likely to be fulfilled  after about two

hours the white apparition would return to her snug retreat  where she

would wait for daylight and her bedtime  inhaling the sweet odor of the

flowers she had collected for her little nest  and listening to the

singing of the nightingales in the petit nesle  and the crowing of the

cocks in the pré aux clercs 



just before dawn ascanio would return to his beloved once more  bringing

her daily supply of provisions  adroitly subtracted from dame ruperta s

larder by virtue of cellini s complicity  then they would sit for a

while  conversing as only lovers can converse  evoking memories of the

past  and forming plans for the future when they should be man and wife 

sometimes ascanio would sit silently contemplating colombe  and colombe

would meet his earnest gaze with her sweet smile  often when they parted

they had not exchanged a single word  but those were the occasions on

which they said most  had not each of them in his or her heart all that

the other could have said  in addition to what the heart cannot say  but

god reads 



grief and solitude have this advantage in youth  that  while they make

the heart nobler and greater  they preserve its freshness  colombe  a

proud  dignified maiden  was at the same time a light hearted young

madcap  so there were days when they laughed as well as days when they

dreamed   days when they played together like children  and  most

astonishing thing of all  those days  or nights  for  as we have seen 

the young people had inverted the order of nature  were not the ones

that passed most quickly  love  like every other shining thing  needs a

little darkness to make its light shine the brighter 



never did ascanio utter a word that could alarm the timid  innocent

child who called him brother  they were alone  and they loved each

other  but for the very reason that they were alone they were the more

conscious of the presence of god  whose heaven they saw nearer at hand 

and for the very reason that they loved each other  they respected their

love as a divinity 



as soon as the first rays of dawn began to cast a feeble light upon the

roofs of the houses  colombe regretfully sent her friend away  but

called him back as many times as juliet did romeo  one or the other had

always forgotten something of the greatest importance  however  they had

to part at last  and colombe  up to the moment  toward noon  when she

committed her heart to god  and slept the sleep of the angels  would sit

alone  and dream  listening to the voices whispering in her heart  and

to the little birds singing under the lindens in her old garden  it goes

without saying that ascanio always carried the ladder away with him 



every morning she strewed bread around the mouth of the statue for the

little birds  the bold faced little fellows would come and seize it  and

fly quickly away again at first  but they gradually grew tame  birds

seem to understand the hearts of young girls  who are winged like

themselves  they finally would remain for a long while  and would pay in

song for the banquet with which colombe regaled them  there was one

audacious goldfinch who ventured within the room  and finally acquired

the habit of eating from colombe s hand at morning and evening  when the

nights began to be a little cool  one night he allowed himself to be

taken captive by the young prisoner  who put him in her bosom  and there

he slept until morning  notwithstanding ascanio s visit and colombe s

nightly promenade  after that the willing captive never failed to return

at night  at daybreak he would begin to sing  colombe would then hold

him for ascanio to kiss  and set him at liberty 



thus did colombe s days glide by in the head of the statue  only two

things occurred to disturb the tranquillity of her existence  those two

things were the provost s domiciliary visits  once colombe awoke with a

start at the sound of her father s voice  it was no dream  he was down

in the garden beneath her  and benvenuto was saying to him   you ask

what this colossal figure is  monsieur d estourville  it is the statue

of mars  which his majesty condescended to order for fontainebleau  a

little bauble sixty feet high  as you see  



 it is of noble proportions  and very beautiful   replied d estourville 

 but let us go on  this is not what i am in search of  



 no  it would be too easy to find  



and they passed on 



colombe  kneeling with outstretched arms  felt an intense longing to cry

out   father  father  i am here   the old man was seeking his child 

weeping for her perhaps  but the thought of comte d orbec  the hateful

schemes of madame d etampes  and the memory of the conversation ascanio

overheard  paralyzed her impulse  and on the second visit the same

impulse did not come to her when the voice of the odious count was

mingled with the provost s 



 there s a curious statue built just like a house   said d orbec  as he

halted at the foot of the colossus   if it stands through the winter 

the swallows will build their nests in it in the spring  



on the morning of the day when the mere voice of her  fiancé  so

alarmed colombe  ascanio had brought her a letter from cellini 





 my child   so ran the letter   i am obliged to go away  but have no

fear  i leave everything prepared for your deliverance and your

happiness  the king s word guarantees my success  and the king you know

has never been false to his word  from to day your father also will be

absent  do not despair  i have now had all the time that i needed 

therefore i say to you again  dear girl  though you should be at the

church door  though you should be kneeling at the altar  and on the

point of uttering the words which bind you for life  let things take

their course  providence will intervene in time  i swear to you  adieu 



 your father 



 benvenuto cellini  





this letter  which filled colombe s heart with joy by reviving her

hopes  had the unfortunate result of causing the poor children to feel a

dangerous sense of security  youth is incapable of moderate feelings  it

leaps at one bound from despair to the fullest confidence  in its eyes

the sky is always black with tempests or resplendently clear  being

rendered doubly confident by the provost s absence and cellini s letter 

they neglected their precautions  and thought more of their love and

less of prudence  colombe was not so guarded in her movements  and dame

perrine saw her  but luckily mistook her for the monk s ghost  ascanio

lighted the lamp without drawing the curtains  and the light was seen by

dame ruperta  the tales of the two gossips taken in conjunction aroused

the curiosity of jacques aubry  and the indiscreet student  like horace

in the  école des femmes   revealed everything to the very person to

whom he should have revealed absolutely nothing  we know the result of

his disclosures 



let us now return to the hôtel d etampes 



when marmagne was asked how he had stumbled upon his valuable discovery 

he assumed an air of mystery and refused to tell  the truth was too

simple  and did not reflect sufficient credit upon his penetration  he

preferred to let it be understood that he had arrived at the magnificent

results which aroused their wonder by dint of strategy and perseverance 

the duchess was radiant  she went and came  and plied the viscount with

questions  so they had her at last  the little rebel who had terrified

them all  madame d etampes determined to go in person to the hôtel de

nesle to make sure of her friend s good fortune  moreover  after what

had happened after the flight  or rather the abduction  of colombe  the

girl must not be left at the petit nesle  the duchess would take charge

of her  she would take her to the hôtel d etampes  and would keep a

closer watch upon her than duenna and  fiancé  together had done  she

would keep watch upon her as a rival  so that colombe would surely be

well guarded 



the duchess ordered her litter 



 the affair has been kept very secret   said she to the provost   you 

d orbec  are not the man to worry about a childish escapade of this

sort  i don t see  then  what is to prevent the marriage from taking

place  and our plans from being carried out  



 on the same conditions  of course  duchess   said d orbec 



 to be sure  on the same conditions  my dear count  as to benvenuto  

continued the duchess   who is guilty  either as principal or accessory 

of an infamous abduction   never fear  dear viscount  we will avenge

you  while avenging ourselves  



 but i understand  madame   rejoined marmagne   that  the king in his

artistic enthusiasm had made him a solemn promise  in case the statue of

his jupiter should be cast successfully  so that he will simply have to

breathe a wish to see his wish gratified  



 never fear  that s just where i will watch   rejoined the duchess   i

will prepare a surprise for him on that day that will be a surprise

indeed  so rely upon me  and let me manage everything  



that was in truth the best thing they could do  not for a long while had

the duchess seemed so eager  so animated  so charming  her joy

overflowed in spite of her  she sent the provost away in hot haste to

summon his archers  and erelong that functionary  accompanied by d orbec

and marmagne  and preceded by a number of subordinates  arrived at the

door of the hôtel de nesle  followed at a short distance by madame

d etampes  who waited upon the quay  trembling with impatience  and

constantly thrusting her head out of the litter 



it was the dinner hour of the workmen  and ascanio  pagolo  little

jehan  and the women were the only occupants of the grand nesle at the

moment  benvenuto was not expected until the evening of the following

day  or the morning of the day following that  ascanio  who received the

visitors  supposed that it was a third domiciliary visit  and  as he had

very positive orders from the master on that subject  he offered no

resistance  but welcomed them  on the other hand  most courteously 



the provost  his friends and his retainers  went straight to the

foundry 



 open this door for us   said d estourville to ascanio 



the young man s heart was oppressed with a terrible presentiment 

however he might be mistaken  and as the least hesitation might awaken

suspicion  he handed the provost the key without moving a muscle 



 take that long ladder   said the provost to his archers 



they obeyed  and under messire d estourville s guidance marched straight

to the statue  there the provost himself put the ladder in place  and

prepared to ascend  but ascanio  pale with terror and wrath placed his

foot on the first round 



 what is your purpose  messieurs   he cried   this statue is the

master s masterpiece  it has been placed in my charge  and the first man

who lays hand upon it for any purpose whatsoever is a dead man  i warn

you  



he drew from his belt a keen edged  slender dagger  of such marvellous

temper that it would cut through a gold crown at a single blow 



the provost gave a signal and his archers advanced upon ascanio pike in

hand  he made a desperate resistance and wounded two men  but he could

do nothing alone against eight  leaving the provost  marmagne  and

d orbec out of the reckoning  he was forced to yield to superior

numbers  he was thrown down  bound and gagged  and the provost started

up the ladder  followed by two sergeants for fear of a surprise 



colombe had heard and seen everything  her father found her in a swoon 

for when she saw ascanio fall she believed him to be dead 



aroused to anger rather than anxiety by this sight  the provost threw

colombe roughly over his broad shoulders  and descended the ladder  the

whole party then returned to the quay  the archers escorting ascanio  at

whom d orbec gazed most earnestly  pagolo saw his comrade pass and did

not stir  little jehan had disappeared  scozzone alone  understanding

nothing of what had taken place  tried to bar the door  crying   



 what means this violence  messieurs  why are you taking ascanio away 

who is this woman  



but at that moment the veil which covered colombe s face fell off  and

scozzone recognized the model for the statue of hebe 



thereupon she stood aside  pale with jealousy  and allowed the provost

and his people  as well as their prisoners  to pass without another

word 



 what does this mean  and why have you abused this boy so   demanded

madame d etampes  when she saw ascanio bound  and pale and covered with

blood   unbind him  unbind him  



 madame   said the provost   this same boy resisted us desperately  he

wounded two of my men  he is his master s accomplice without doubt  and

it seems to me advisable to take him to some safe place  



 and furthermore   said d orbec in an undertone to the duchess   he so

strongly resembles the italian page i saw at your reception  and who was

present throughout our conversation  that  if he were not dressed

differently  and if i had not heard him speak the language which you

assured me the page could not understand  upon my honor  madame la

duchesse  i would swear it was he  



 you are right  monsieur le prévôt   said madame d etampes hastily 

thinking better of the order she had given to set ascanio at liberty 

 you are right  this young man may be dangerous  make sure of his

person  



 to the châtelet with the prisoner   said the provost 



 and we   said the duchess  at whose side colombe  still unconscious 

had been placed    we  messieurs  will return to the hôtel d etampes  



a moment later the hoof beats of a galloping horse rang out upon the

pavement  it was little jehan  riding off at full speed to tell cellini

what had taken place at the hôtel de nesle 



ascanio  meanwhile  was committed to the châtelet without having seen

the duchess  and in ignorance of the part played by her in the event

which destroyed his hopes 









x





the rivals





madame d etampes  who had been so desirous to see colombe at close

quarters ever since she had first heard of her  had her heart s desire

at last  the poor child lay there before her in a swoon 



the jealous duchess did not once cease to gaze at her throughout the

whole journey to the hôtel d etampes  her eyes  blazing with anger when

she saw how beautiful she was  scrutinized each of her charms  analyzed

each feature  and passed in review one after another all the elements

which went to make up the perfect beauty of the pale cheeked girl who

was at last in her power and under her hand  the two women  who were

inspired with the same passion and disputing possession of the same

heart  were face to face at last  one all powerful and malevolent  the

other weak  but beloved  one with her splendor  the other with her

youth  one with her passion  the other with her innocence  separated by

so many obstacles  they had finally come roughly in contact  and the

duchess s velvet robe brushed against colombe s simple white gown 



though colombe was in a swoon  anne was not the least pale of the two 

doubtless her mute contemplation of her companion s loveliness caused

her pride to despair  and destroyed her hopes  for while  in her own

despite  she murmured   they told me truly  she is lovely  very lovely  

her hand  which held colombe s  pressed it so convulsively that the

young girl was brought to her senses by the pain  and opened her great

eyes  saying   



 oh  madame  you hurt me  



as soon as the duchess saw that colombe s eyes were open  she let her

hand fall  but the consciousness of pain preceded the return of the

faculty of thought  for some seconds after she uttered the words  she

continued to gaze wonderingly at the duchess  as if she could not

collect her thoughts 



 who are you  madame   she said at last   and whither are you taking

me   then she suddenly drew away from her  crying   



 ah  you are the duchesse d etampes  i remember  i remember  



 hush   returned anne imperiously   hush  soon we shall be alone  and

you can wonder and cry out at your ease  



these words were accompanied by a stern  haughty glance  but it was a

sense of her own dignity  and not the glance  which imposed silence upon

colombe  she said not another word until they reached the hôtel

d etampes  where  at a sign from the duchess  she followed her to her

oratory 



when the rivals were at last alone and face to face  they eyed each

other for one or two minutes without speaking  but with very different

expressions  colombe was calm  for her trust in providence and in

benvenuto sustained her  anne was furious at her calmness  but although

her fury was clearly evidenced by the contortion of her features  she

did not give expression to it  for she relied upon her imperious will 

and her unbounded power to crush the feeble creature before her  she was

the first to break the silence 



 well  my young friend   she said  in a tone which left no doubt as to

the bitterness of the thought  although the words were soft   you are

restored to your father  at last  it is well  but allow me first of all

to compliment you upon your courage  you are  bold for your age  my

child  



 i have god on my side  madame   rejoined colombe simply 



 what god do you refer to  mademoiselle  oh  the god mars  of course  

returned the duchess with one of those impertinent winks which she so

often had occasion to resort to at court 



 i know but one god  madame  the eternal god  merciful and protecting 

who teaches charity in prosperity  and humility in grandeur  woe to them

who know not the god of whom i speak  for there will come a day when he

will not know them  



 very good  mademoiselle  very good   said the duchess   the situation

is admirably adapted for a moral lecture  and i would congratulate you

upon your happy choice of a subject if i did not prefer to think that

you are trying to excuse your wantonness by impudence  



 in truth  madame   replied colombe  without bitterness  but with a

slight shrug of the shoulders   i do not seek to excuse myself to you 

because i am as yet ignorant of any right on your part to accuse me 

when my father chooses to question me  i shall reply with respect and

sorrow  if he reproves me i will try to justify myself  but until then 

madame la duchesse  permit me to hold my peace  



 i understand that my voice annoys you  and you would prefer  would you

not  to remain alone with your thoughts and think at leisure of the man

you love  



 no noise  however annoying it may be  can prevent me from thinking of

him  madame  especially when he is unhappy  



 you dare confess that you love him  



 that is the difference between us  madame  you love him  and dare not

confess it  



 impudent hussy   cried the duchess   upon my word i believe she defies

me  



 alas  no   replied colombe softly   i do not defy you  i reply  simply

because you force me to reply  leave me alone with my thoughts  and i

will leave you alone with your schemes  



 very good  since you drive me to it  child  since you imagine that you

are strong enough to contend with me  since you confess your love  i

will confess mine  but at the same time i will confess my hatred  yes 

i love ascanio  and i hate you  after all  why should i dissemble with

you  the only person to whom i may say whatever i choose  for you are

the only one who  whatever you say  will not be believed  yes  i love

ascanio  



 in that case i pity you  madame   rejoined colombe softly   for ascanio

loves me  



 yes  it is true  ascanio does love you  but by seduction if i can  by

falsehood if i must  by a crime if it becomes necessary  i will steal

his love away from you  mark that  i am anne d heilly  duchesse

d etampes  



 ascanio  madame  will love the one who loves him best  



 in god s name hear her   cried the duchess  exasperated by such sublime

confidence   would not one think that her love is unique  and that no

other love can be compared to it  



 i do not say that  madame  for the reason that i love  i know that

other hearts may love as i do  but i doubt if yours is one of them  



 what would you do for him  come  let us see  you who boast of this love

of yours which mine can never equal  what have you sacrificed for him

thus far  an obscure life and wearisome solitude  



 no  madame  but my peace of mind  



 you have given him preference over what  comte d orbec s absurd love  



 no  madame  but my filial obedience  



 what have you to give him  can you make him rich  powerful  feared  



 no  madame  but i hope to make him happy  



 ah   exclaimed the duchess   it s a very different matter with me  and

i do much more for him  i sacrifice a king s affection  i lay wealth 

titles  and honors at his feet  i bring him a kingdom to govern  



 yes   said colombe with a smile   it s true that your love gives him

everything that is not love  



 enough  enough of this insulting comparison   cried the duchess

violently  feeling that she was losing ground step by step 



thereupon ensued a momentary pause  during which colombe seemed to feel

no embarrassment  while madame d etampes succeeded in concealing hers

only by revealing her anger  however  her features gradually relaxed 

her faee assumed a milder expression  lightened by a gleam of real or

feigned benevolence  she was the first to reopen the conflict which she

did not propose should end otherwise than in a triumph 



 let us see  colombe   said she in a tone that was almost affectionate 

 if some one should bid you sacrifice your life for him  what would you

do  



 ah  i would give it to him blissfully  



 and so would i   cried the duchess with an accent which proved the

violence of her passion  if not the sincerity of the sacrifice 



 but your honor   she continued   would you sacrifice that as well as

your life  



 if by my honor you mean my reputation  yes  if by my honor you mean my

virtue  no  



 what  you do not belong to him  is he not your lover  



 he is my  fiancé   madame  that is all  



 oh  she doesn t love him   rejoined the duchess   she doesn t love

him  she prefers her honor  a mere empty word  to him  



 if some one were to say to you  madame   retorted colombe  angered in

spite of her sweet disposition   if some one were to say to you 

 renounce for his sake your titles and your grandeur  abandon the king

for him   not in secret  that would be too easy   but publicly   if some

one were to say to you   anne d heilly  duchesse d etampes  leave your

palace  your luxurious surroundings  and your courtiers for his humble

artist s studio   



 i would refuse in his own interest   replied the duchess  as if it were

impossible to say what was false beneath the profound  penetrating gaze

of her rival 



 you would refuse  



 yes  



 ah  she doesn t love him   cried colombe   she prefers honors  mere

chimeras  to him  



 but when i tell you that i wish to retain my position for his sake  

returned the duchess  exasperated anew by this fresh triumph of her

rival    when i tell you that i wish to retain my honors so that he may

share them  all men care for them sooner or later  



 yes   replied colombe  smiling   but ascanio is not one of them  



 hush   cried anne  stamping her foot in passion 



thus had the cunning and powerful duchess signally failed to gain the

upper hand over a mere girl  whom she expected to intimidate simply by

raising her voice  to her questions  angry or satirical  colombe had

made answer with a modest tranquillity which disconcerted her  she

realized that the blind impulsion of her hatred had led her astray  so

she changed her tactics  to tell the truth  she had not reckoned upon

the possession of so much beauty or so much wit by her rival  and 

finding that she could not bend her  she determined to take her by

surprise 



colombe as we have seen  was not alarmed by the double explosion of

madame d etampes s wrath  but simply took refuge in cold and dignified

silence  the duchess  however  following out the new plan she had

adopted  now approached her with her most fascinating smile  and took

her affectionately by the hand 



 forgive me  my child   she said   but i fear i lost my temper  you must

not bear me ill will for it  you have the advantage of me in so many

ways  that it s natural that i should be jealous  alas  you  no doubt 

like everybody else  consider me a wicked woman  but  in truth  my

destiny is at fault  not i  forgive me  therefore  because we both

happen to love ascanio is no reason why we should hate each other  and

then he loves you alone  so  t is your duty to be indulgent  let us be

sisters  what say you  let us talk frankly together  and i will try to

efface from your mind the unfortunate impression which my foolish anger

may have left there  



 madame   said colombe  with reserve  and withdrawing her hand with an

instinctive movement of repulsion  but she added at once   speak  i am

listening  



 oh   said madame d etampes playfully  and as if she understood

perfectly her companion s reserve   have no fear  little savage  i do

not ask for your friendship without a guaranty  in order that you may

know what manner of woman i am  that you may know me as i know myself  i

propose to tell you in two words the story of my life  my heart has

little to do with my story  and we poor women  who are called great

ladies  are so often slandered  ah  envy does very wrong to speak ill of

us when we are fitter subjects for compassion  for instance  what is

your judgment of me  my child  be frank  you look upon me as a lost

woman  do you not  



colombe made a gesture indicative of the embarrassment she felt at the

idea of replying to such a question 



 but if i am a lost woman  is it my fault  you in your happiness 

colombe  must not be too hard upon those who have suffered   you who

have lived hitherto in innocent solitude  and do not know what it is to

be reared upon ambitious dreams  for they who are destined to that

torture  like victims decked out with flowers  see only the bright side

of life  there is no question of love  simply of pleading  so it was

that from my earliest youth my thoughts were all bent upon fascinating

the king  the beauty which god gives to woman to be exchanged for true

love  i was forced to exchange for a title  they made of my charms a

snare  tell me now  colombe  what could be the fate of a poor child 

taken in hand before she has learned to know the difference between good

and evil  and who is told   the good is evil  the evil is good   and so 

you see  although others despair of me  i do not despair of myself 

perhaps god will forgive me  for no one stood beside me to tell me of

him  what was there for me to do  alone as i was  and weak and

defenceless  craft and deceit have made up my whole life from that time

on  and yet i was not made to play such a hideous rôle  the proof is

that i love ascanio  and that when i found that i loved him i was happy

and ashamed at the same time  now tell me  my pure  darling child  do

you understand me  



 yes   innocently replied colombe  deceived by this false good faith 

this lie masquerading in the guise of truth 



 then you will have pity on me   cried the duchess   you will let me

love ascanio from a distance  all by myself  hopelessly  and in that way

i shall not be your rival  for he will not care for me  and  in return 

i  who know the world and its snares  its pitfalls and deceit  will take

the place of the mother you have lost  i will guide you  i will save

you  now you see that you can trust me  for you save my life  a child in

whose heart the passions of a woman were sown  that in brief is my past 

my present you see for yourself  it is the shame of being the declared

mistress of a king  my future is my love for ascanio   not his for me 

because  as you have said  and as i have very often told myself  ascanio

will never love me  but for the very reason that love will remain

pure it will purify me  now it is your turn  to speak  to open your

heart  to tell me everything  tell me your story  dear girl  



 my story  madame  is very brief and very simple   said colombe   it may

all be summed up in three loves  i have loved  i love  and i shall

love   god  my father  and ascanio  but in the past my love for ascanio 

whom i had not then met  was a dream  at present it is a cause of

suffering  in the future  it is a hope  



 very good   said the duchess  restraining her jealousy  and forcing

back her tears   but do not half confide in me  colombe  what do you

mean to do now  how can you  poor child  contend with two such powerful

wills as your father s and comte d orbec s  to say nothing of the king s

having seen you and fallen in love with you  



 o mon dieu   murmured colombe 



 but as this passion on the king s part was the work of the duchesse

d etampes  your rival  your friend  anne d heilly will deliver you from

it  so we won t disturb ourselves about the king  but your father and

the count must be reckoned with  their ambition is less easy to balk

than the commonplace fancy of the king  



 oh  do not be half kind   cried colombe   save me from the others as

well as from the king  



 i know but one way   said madame d etampes  seeming to reflect 



 what is that  



 you will take fright  and refuse to adopt it  



 oh  if only courage is required  tell me what it is  



 come here  and listen to me   said the duchess  affectionately drawing

colombe to a seat upon a stool beside her arm chair  and passing her arm

around her waist   don t be alarmed  i beg  at the first words i say  



 is it very terrifying   colombe asked 



 your virtue is unbending  and unspotted  my dear little one  but we

live  alas  at a time and in a society where such fascinating innocence

is but a danger the more  for it places you  without means of defence 

at the mercy of your enemies  whom you cannot fight with the weapons

they use to attack you  so make an effort  descend from the heights to

which your dreams have transported you  to the lower level of reality 

you said just now that you would sacrifice your reputation for ascanio 

i do not ask so much as that  but simply that you sacrifice the

appearance of fidelity to him  it is pure madness for you  alone and

helpless  to struggle against your destiny  for you  the daughter of a

gentleman  to dream of marriage with a goldsmith s apprentice  come 

trust the advice of a sincere friend  do not resist them  but let them

have their way  remain at heart the spotless fiancé  the wife of

ascanio  and give your hand to comte d orbec  his ambitious schemes

require that you should bear his name  but once you are comtesse

d orbec  you can easily overturn his detestable schemes  for you have

only to raise your voice and complain  whereas now  who would take your

part in the contest  no one  even i cannot assist you against the

legitimate authority of a father  while  if it were a question of

foiling your husband s combinations  you would soon see me at work 

reflect upon what i say  to remain your own mistress  obey  to become

independent  pretend to abandon your liberty  strong in the thought that

ascanio is your lawful husband  and that union with any other is mere

sacrilege  you may do what your heart bids you  and your conscience will

be at rest  while the world  in whose eyes appearances will be

preserved  will take your part  



 madame  madame   murmured colombe  rising and straightening herself

against the duchess s arm  as she sought to detain her   i am not sure

that i understand you aright  but it seems to me that you are advising

me to do an infamous thing  



 what do you say   cried the duchess 



 i say that virtue is not so subtle as all that  madame  i say that your

sophistries make me blush for you  i say that beneath the cloak of

friendship with which you conceal your hatred  i see the net you have

spread for me  you wish to dishonor me in ascanio s eyes  do you not 

because you know that ascanio will never love or will cease to love the

woman he despises  



 well  yes   said the duchess  bursting forth at last   i am weary of

wearing a mask  ah  you will not fall into the net i have spread  you

say  very good  then you will fall into the abyss i will push you into 

hear this  whether you will or no  you shall marry d orbec  



 in that case the force put upon me will be my excuse  and by yielding 

if i do yield  i shall not have profaned my heart s religion  



 pray  do you mean to resist  



 by every means in the power of a poor girl  i warn you that i will say

no  to the end  you may put my hand in that man s  i will say no  you

may drag me before the altar  i will say no  you may force me to kneel

at the priest s feet  and to the priest s face i will say no  



 what matters it  ascanio will believe that you have consented to the

marriage that is forced upon you  



 for that reason i hope i may not have to submit to it  madame  



 upon whom do you rely to come to your assistance  



 upon god above  and upon a man on earth  



 but the man is a prisoner  



 the man is free  madame  



 why  who is the man  i pray to know  



 benvenuto cellini  



the duchess ground her teeth when she heard the name of the man she

considered her deadliest foe  but as she was on the point of repeating

the name  accompanied by some terrible imprecation  a page raised the

portière and announced the king 



at that announcement she darted from the room to meet françois i  with

a smile upon her lips  and led him to her own apartments  motioning to

her people to keep watch upon colombe 









xi





benvenuto at bay





an hour after the imprisonment of ascanio and the abduction of colombe 

benvenuto cellini rode along the quai des augustins at a footpace  he

had just parted from the king and the court  whom he had amused

throughout the journey by innumerable tales  told as he only could tell

them  mingled with anecdotes of his own adventures  but when he was once

more alone he became thoughtful and abstracted  the frivolous talker

gave place to the profound dreamer  while his hand shook the rein  his

brain was busily at work  he dreamed of the casting of his jupiter  upon

which depended his dear ascanio s happiness as well as his artistic

fame  the bronze was fermenting in his brain before being melted in the

furnace  outwardly he was calm 



when he reached the door of the hôtel de nesle he stopped for a moment 

amazed not to hear the sound of hammering  the blackened walls of the

château were mute and gloomy  as if no living thing were within  twice

the master rapped without obtaining a reply  at the third summons

scozzone opened the door 



 ah  there you are  master   she cried when she saw that it was

benvenuto   alas  why did you not return two hours earlier  



 what has happened  in god s name   demanded cellini 



 the provost  comte d orbec  and the duchesse d etampes have been here  



 well  



 they made a search  



 and then  



 they found colombe in the head of the statue of mars  



 impossible  



 the duchesse d etampes carried colombe home with her  and the provost

ordered ascanio to be taken to the châtelet  



 ah  we have been betrayed   cried benvenuto striking his hand against

his forehead and stamping upon the ground  as his first thought on every

occasion was of vengeance  he left his horse to find his own way to the

stable  and darted into the studio 



 come hither  all of you   he cried    all  



thereupon each one had to undergo an examination in due form  but they

were all equally ignorant  not only of colombe s hiding place  but of

the means by which her enemies had succeeded in discovering it  there

was not a single one  including pagolo  upon whom the master s suspicion

fell first of all  who did not exculpate himself in a way that left no

doubt in benvenuto s mind  it is needless to say that he did not for an

instant suspect hermann  and simon le gaucher for no more than an

instant 



when he became convinced that he could learn nothing in that direction 

benvenuto  with the rapidity of decision which was usual with him  made

up his mind what course to pursue  and having made sure that his sword

was at his side and that his dagger moved easily in its sheath  he

ordered everybody to remain at home in order to be at hand in case of

need  he then left the studio  and hurried across the courtyard into the

street 



his features  his gait  and his every movement  bore the stamp of

intense excitement  a thousand thoughts  a thousand schemes  a thousand

painful reflections  were jostling one another confusedly in his head 

ascanio failed him at the moment when his presence was most essential 

for all his apprentices  with the most intelligent of them all at their

head  were none too many for the casting of his jupiter  colombe was

abducted  and colombe in the midst of her foes might lose heart  the

serene  sublime confidence which served the poor child as a bulwark

against evil thoughts and perverse designs would perhaps grow weaker  or

abandon her altogether  in such a maze of plots and threats  with all

the rest  he remembered that one day he had spoken to ascanio of the

possibility of some cruel vengeance on the part of the duchesse

d etampes  whereupon ascanio replied with a smile   



 she will not dare to ruin me  for with a word i could ruin her  



benvenuto sought to learn the secret  but ascanio would make no other

reply to his questions than this   



 to day it would be treachery  master  wait until the day comes when it

will be only a legitimate means of defence  



benvenuto understood the delicacy which closed his mouth  and waited 

how it was necessary that he should see ascanio  and his first endeavors

should be directed to that end 



with benvenuto the wish led at once to the decision necessarily to

gratify it  he had hardly said to himself that he must see ascanio 

before he was knocking at the door of the châtelet  the wicket opened 

and one of the provost s people asked cellini who he was  another man

was standing behind him in the shadow 



 my name is benvenuto cellini   replied the goldsmith 



 what do you wish  



 to see a prisoner who is confined herein  



 what is his name  



 ascanio  



 ascanio is in secret and can see no one  



 why is he in secret  



 because he is charged with a crime punishable with death  



 an additional reason why i should see him   cried benvenuto 



 your logic is most extraordinary  signor cellini   said the man who was

standing in the background  in a jeering tone   and doesn t pass

current at the châtelet  



 who laughs when i proffer a request  who jeers when i implore a favor  

cried benvenuto 



 i   said the voice    i  robert d estourville  provost of paris  to

each his turn  signor cellini  every contest consists of a game and

revenge  you won the first bout  and the second is mine  you illegally

took my property  i legally take your apprentice  you refused to return

the one to me  so never fear  i will not return the other to you  you

are gallant and enterprising  you have an army of devoted retainers 

come on  my stormer of citadels  come on  my scaler of walls  come on 

my burster in of doors  come and take the châtelet  i am waiting for

you  



with that the wicket was closed 



benvenuto  with a roar  darted at the massive iron door  but could make

no impression upon it with the united efforts of his feet and hands 



 come on  my friend  come on  strike  strike   cried the provost from

the other side of the door   you will only succeed in making a noise 

and if you make too much  beware the watch  beware the archers  ah  the

châtelet isn t like the hôtel de nesle  you ll find  it belongs to

our lord the king  and we shall see if you are more powerful in france

than the king  



benvenuto cast his eyes about and saw upon the quay an uprooted

mile stone which two ordinary men would have found difficulty in

lifting  he walked to where it lay picked it up and put it on his

shoulder as easily as a child could do the same with a pebble  he had

taken but a step or two  however  when he reflected that  when the door

was broken in  he should find the guard waiting for him  and the result

would be that he should himself be imprisoned   imprisoned when

ascanio s liberty was dependent upon his own  he therefore dropped the

stone  which was driven some inches into the ground by its own weight 



doubtless the provost was watching him from some invisible loophole  for

he heard a burst of laughter 



benvenuto hurried away at full speed  lest he should yield to the desire

to dash his head against the accursed door 



he went directly to the hôtel d etampes 



all was not lost  if  failing to see ascanio  he could see colombe 

perhaps ascanio  in the overflowing of his heart  had confided to his

beloved the secret he had refused to confide to his master 



all went well at first  the gateway of the mansion was open  he crossed

the courtyard and entered the reception room  where stood a tall footman

with lace on all the seams of his livery   a sort of colossus four feet

wide and six high 



 who are you   he demanded  eying the goldsmith from head to foot 



at another time benvenuto would have answered his insolent stare by one

of his customary violent outbursts  but it was essential that he should

see colombe  ascanio s welfare was at stake  so he restrained himself 



 i am benvenuto cellini  the florentine goldsmith   he replied 



 what do you wish  



 to see mademoiselle colombe  



 mademoiselle colombe is not visible  



 why is she not visible  



 because her father  messire d estourville  provost of paris  gave her

in charge to madame d etampes  and requested her to keep an eye upon

her  



 but i am a friend  



 an additional reason for suspecting you  



 i tell you that i must see her   said benvenuto  beginning to get warm 



 and i tell you that you shall not see her   retorted the servant 



 is madame d etampes visible  



 no more than mademoiselle colombe  



 not even to me  her jeweller  



 less to you than to any other person  



 do you mean that orders have been given not to admit me  



 just so   replied the servant   you have put your finger on the spot  



 do you know that i am a strange man  my friend   said benvenuto  with

the terrible laugh which ordinarily preceded his outbursts of wrath 

 and that the place i am forbidden to enter is the place i am accustomed

to enter  



 how will you do it  eh  you amuse me  



 when there is a door  and a blackguard like you in front of it  for

instance   



 well   said the valet 



 well   retorted benvenuto  suiting the action to the word   i overturn

the blackguard  and break in the door  



and with a blow of his fist he laid the valet sprawling on the floor 

and burst in the door with a blow of his foot 



 help   cried the servant   help  



but the poor devil s cry of distress was not needed  as benvenuto passed

into the reception room he found himself confronted by six others 

evidently stationed there to receive him  he at once divined that madame

d etampes had been informed of his return  and had taken measures

accordingly 



under any other circumstances  armed as he was with dagger and sword 

benvenuto would have fallen upon them  and would probably have given a

good account of himself  but such an act of violence in the abode of the

king s mistress might have deplorable results  for the second time 

contrary to his custom  common sense carried the day over wrath  and 

being certain that he could at all events have audience of the king  to

whose presence  as we know  he had the privilege of being admitted at

any hour  he replaced his sword  already half drawn  in its scabbard 

retraced his steps  pausing at every movement in his rear  like a lion

in retreat  walked slowly across the courtyard  and bent his steps

toward the louvre 



benvenuto once more assumed a calm demeanor  and walked with measured

step  but his tranquillity was only apparent  great drops of

perspiration were rolling down his cheeks  and his wrath was rising

mountain high within his breast  his superhuman efforts to master it

making him suffer the more  indeed  nothing could be more utterly

antipathetic to his impulsive nature than delay  than the wretched

obstacle of a closed door  or the vulgar insolence of a lackey  strong

men who command their thoughts are never so near despair as when they

come in collision with some material obstacle and struggle to no purpose

to surmount it  benvenuto would have given ten years of his life to have

some man jostle him  and as he walked along he raised his head from time

to time and gazed threateningly at those who passed  as if he would

say   



 isn t there some unfortunate wretch among you who is tired of life  if

so  let him apply to me  i m his man  



a quarter of an hour later he reached the louvre and went at once to the

apartment set apart for the pages  requesting immediate speech of his

majesty  it was his purpose to tell françois the whole story  and make

an appeal to his loyalty  and  if he could not obtain ascanio s release 

to solicit permission to see him  as he came through the streets he

considered what language he would use to the king  and as he had some

pretensions to eloquence he was well content with the little speech he

had prepared  the excitement  the terrible news he had learned so

suddenly  the insults heaped upon him  the obstacles he could not

overcome  all these had combined to set the blood on fire in the

irascible artist s veins  his temples throbbed  his heart beat quickly 

his hands shook  he did not himself know the extent of the feverish

agitation which multiplied the energy of his body and his heart  a whole

day is sometimes concentrated in one minute 



in such a frame of mind was benvenuto when he appealed to a page for

admission to the king s apartments 



 the king is not visible   was the young man s reply 



 do you not recognize me   asked benvenuto in surprise 



 perfectly  



 i am benvenuto cellini  and his majesty is always visible to me  



 it is precisely because you are benvenuto cellini   returned the page 

 that you cannot enter  



benvenuto was thunderstruck 



 ah  is it you  m  de termes   continued the page  addressing a courtier

who arrived just behind the goldsmith   pass in  pass in  comte de la

paye  pass in  marquis des prés  



 and what of me  what of me  pray   cried benvenuto  turning white with

anger 



 you  the king  when he returned ten minutes since  said   if that

insolent florentine makes his appearance  let him know that i do not

choose to receive him  and advise him to be submissive unless he desires

to make a comparison between the castle of san angelo and the

châtelet  



 help me  patience  oh help me   muttered benvenuto in a hollow voice 

 vrai dieu  i am not accustomed to being made to wait by kings  the

vatican s no less a place than the louvre  and leo x  is no less great a

man than françois i   and yet i was not kept waiting at the door of the

vatican  nor at that of leo x  but i understand  it s like this  the

king was with madame d etampes   yes  the king has just come from his

mistress and has been put on his guard by her against me  yes  that s

the way it is  patience for ascanio  patience for colombe  



notwithstanding his praiseworthy resolution to be patient  however 

benvenuto was obliged to lean against a pillar for support  his heart

was swollen to bursting  and his legs trembled under him  this last

insult not only wounded him in his pride  but in his friendship  his

soul was filled with bitterness and despair  and his clenched hands  his

frown  and his tightly closed lips bore witness to the violence of his

suffering 



however  in a moment or two he recovered himself  tossed back the hair

which was falling over his brow  and left the palace with firm and

resolute step  all who were present watched him with something very like

respect as he walked away 



benvenuto s apparent tranquillity was due to the marvellous power he

possessed over himself  for he was in reality more confused and

desperate than a stag at bay  he wandered through the streets for some

time  heedless as to where he might be  hearing nothing but the buzzing

of the blood in his ears  and vaguely wondering  as one does in

intoxication  whether he was awake or asleep  it was the third time he

had been shown the door within an hour  it was the third time that doors

had been shut in his face   in his face  benvenuto s  the favorite of

princes  popes  and kings  before whom all doors were thrown open to

their fullest extent when his footsteps were heard approaching  and yet 

notwithstanding this threefold affront  he had not the right to give way

to his anger  he must dissemble  and hide his humiliation until he had

rescued colombe and ascanio  the throng through which he passed 

thoughtless or full of business  seemed to him to read upon his brow the

story of the repeated insults he had undergone  it was perhaps the only

moment in his whole life when his great heart lost faith in itself  but

after ten or fifteen minutes of this aimless  blind wandering  his will

reasserted itself  and he raised his head  his depression left him  and

the fever returned 



 go to   he cried aloud  to such a degree did his mind dominate his

body   go to  in vain do they crowd the man  they cannot throw down the

artist  come  sculptor  and make them repent of their base deeds when

they admire thy handiwork  come  jupiter  and prove that thou art still 

not the king of the gods alone  but the master of mankind  



as he spoke  benvenuto  acting upon an impulse stronger than himself 

bent his step toward the tournelles  that former royal residence  where

the old constable  anne de montmorency  still dwelt 



the effervescent artist was required to await his turn for an hour

before he was admitted to the presence of the warrior minister of

françois i   who was besieged by a mob of courtiers and petitioners  at

last he was introduced 



anne de montmorency was a man of great height  little if any bent by

age  cold  stiff  and spare  with a piercing glance and an abrupt manner

of speaking  he was forever scolding  and no one ever saw him in good

humor  he would have looked upon it as a humiliation to be surprised

with a laugh upon his face  how had this morose old man succeeded in

making himself agreeable to the amiable and gracious prince  who then

governed france  it is something that can be explained in no other way

than by the law of contrasts  françois i  had a way of sending away

satisfied those whose petitions he refused  the constable  on the other

hand  arranged matters in such a way that those whom he gratified went

away in a rage  he was only moderately endowed in the way of genius  but

he won the king s confidence by his military inflexibility and his

dictatorial gravity 



when benvenuto entered  montmorency was  as usual  striding back and

forth in his apartment  he nodded in response to the goldsmith s

salutation  then paused in his walk  and  fixing his piercing gaze upon

him  inquired   



 who are you  



 benvenuto cellini  



 your profession 



 goldsmith to the king   replied the artist  wondering to find that his

first reply did not make the second question unnecessary 



 ah  yes  yes   growled the constable   i recognize you  well  what do

you want  what have you to ask  my friend  that i give you an order  if

you have counted on that  your time is thrown away  i give you warning 

upon my word  i have no patience with this mania for art which is raging

so everywhere to day  one would say it was an epidemic that has attacked

every one except myself  no  sculpture doesn t interest me in the very

least  master goldsmith  do you hear  so apply to others  and good

night  



benvenuto made a gesture  but before he could speak  the constable

continued   



 mon dieu  don t let that discourage you  you will find plenty of

courtiers who like to ape the king  and noodles who pose as

connoisseurs  as for me  hark ye  i stick to my trade  which is to wage

war  and i tell you frankly that i much prefer a good  healthy

peasant woman  who gives me a child  that is to say  a soldier  every

ten months  than a wretched sculptor  who wastes his time turning out a

crowd of men of bronze who are good for nothing but to raise the price

of cannon  



 monseigneur   said benvenuto  who had listened to this long heretical

harangue with a degree of patience which amazed himself   i am not here

to speak upon artistic subjects  but upon a matter of honor  



 ah  that s a different matter  what do you desire of me  tell me

quickly  



 do you remember  monseigneur  that his majesty once said to me in your

presence that  on the day when i should bring him the statue of jupiter

cast in bronze  he would grant whatever favor i might ask  and that he

bade you  monseigneur  and chancelier poyet remind him of his promise in

the event of his forgetting it  



 i remember  what then  



 the moment is at hand  monseigneur  when i shall implore you to provide

a memory for the king  will you do it  



 is that what you come here to ask me  monsieur   cried the constable 

 have you intruded upon me to beg me to do something i am bound to do  



 monseigneur  



 you re an impertinent fellow  master goldsmith  understand that the

connétable anne de montmorency does not need to be reminded to be an

honorable man  the king bade me remember for him  and that is a

precaution he might well take more frequently  with all due respect  i

shall do as he bade me  even though the reminder be annoying to him 

adieu  master cellini  and make room for others  



with that the constable turned his back on benvenuto  and gave the

signal for another petitioner to be introduced 



benvenuto saluted the constable  whose somewhat brutal frankness was not

displeasing to him  and took his leave  still agitated  and impelled by

the same feverish excitement and the same burning thoughts  he betook

himself to the abode of chancelier poyet  near porte saint antoine  only

a short distance away 



chancelier poyet formed a most striking and complete contrast  moral and

physical  to anne de montmorency  who was always crabbed and always

incased in armor from head to foot  he was polished  shrewd  crafty 

buried in his furs  lost  so to speak  in the ermine  naught could be

seen of him save a bald head surrounded by a grizzly fringe of hair 

intelligent  restless eyes  thin lips  and a white hand  he was quite as

honest perhaps as the constable  but much less outspoken 



there again benvenuto was forced to wait for half an hour  but his

friends would not have recognized him  he had accustomed himself to

waiting 



 monseigneur   he said  when he was at last ushered into the

chancellor s presence   i have come to remind you of a promise the king

made me in your presence  and constituted you not only the witness

thereof but the guarantor  



 i know what you refer to  messire benvenuto   said poyet   and i am

ready  if you wish  to bring his majesty s promise to his mind  but it

is my duty to inform you that  from a legal standpoint  you have no

claim upon him  for an undertaking indefinite in form  and left to your

discretion  cannot be enforced before the courts  and never affords a

cause of action  wherefore  if the king satisfies your demand  he will

do so purely as a matter of generosity and good faith  



 that is as i understand it  monseigneur   said benvenuto   and i simply

have to request you when the occasion arises to fulfil the duty his

majesty intrusted to you  leaving the rest to his good will  



 very well   said poyet   i am at your service  my dear monsieur  to

that extent  



benvenuto thereupon took his leave of the chancellor  with his mind more

at ease  but his blood was still boiling  and his hands were trembling

with fever  his thoughts  excited by the annoyance and irritation and

insults to which he had been subjected  burst forth at last in full

freedom  after their long restraint  space and time no longer existed

for the mind which they overflowed  and as benvenuto strode along toward

his home he saw in a sort of luminous dream del moro s house  stefana 

the castle of san angelo  and colombe s garden  at the same time  he

felt that his strength became more than human  and he seemed to be

living in another world 



he was still laboring under this intense exaltation of feeling when he

entered the hôtel de nesle  all the apprentices were awaiting his

return  in accordance with his commands 



 how for the casting of the jupiter  my children   he cried from the

doorway  and darted into the studio 



 good morning  master   said jacques aubry  who had come in behind

cellini  singing joyously as his wont was   you neither saw nor heard

me  did you  for five minutes i have been following you along the quay 

calling you  you walked so fast that i am quite out of breath  in god s

name  what s the matter with you all  you are as sober as judges  



 to the casting   continued benvenuto  without answering aubry  although

he had seen him out of the corner of his eye  and listened to him with

one ear   to the casting  everything depends upon that  merciful god 

shall we be successful  ah  my friend   he continued  abruptly 

addressing aubry    ah  my dear jacques  what sad news awaited me on my

return  and what a cruel advantage they took of my absence  



 what is the matter  master   cried aubry  really disturbed by cellini s

excitement and the dejection of the apprentices 



 above all things  boys  throw in plenty of dry spruce  you know that i

have been laying in a stock of it for six months  the matter  my good

jacques  is that ascanio is under lock and key at the châtelet  and

that colombe  the provost s daughter  that lovely girl whom ascanio

loves  as you know  is in the hands of the duchesse d etampes  her

enemy  they found her in the statue of mars where i had hidden her  but

we will rescue them  well  well  where are you going  hermann  the

wood s in the yard  not in the cellar  



 ascanio arrested   cried aubry   colombe carried off  



 yes  yes  some villanous spy must have watched them  poor children  and

surprised a secret which i had kept even from you  dear jacques  but if

i discover the knave   to the casting  boys  to the casting   that isn t

all  the king refuses to see me  whom he called his friend  so much for

the friendship of men  to be sure kings are not men  but kings  the

result was that i went to the louvre to no purpose  i could not get

speech of him  ah  but my statue shall speak for me  prepare the mould 

my friends  and let us not lose a moment  that woman insulting poor

colombe  that infamous provost jeering at me  that jailer torturing

ascanio  oh  i have had some fearful visions to day  dear jacques  i

would give ten years of my life to the man who could gain admission to

the prisoner  speak to him  and learn the secret by means of which i may

subdue that arrogant duchess  for ascanio knows a secret which possesses

that power  jacques  and refused to divulge it to me  noble heart  but

no matter  have no fear for thy child  stefana  i will defend him to my

latest breath  and i will save him  yes  i will save him  ah  where is

the vile traitor who betrayed us  that i may strangle him with my own

hands  let me live but three days  stefana  for it seems to me that the

fire which consumes me is burning my life away  oh if i should die

before my jupiter is finished  to the casting  children  to the

casting  



at benvenuto s first words jacques aubry became pale as death  for he

suspected that he was the cause of it all  as the master proceeded  his

suspicion was changed to certainty  thereupon some plan doubtless

suggested itself to him  for he stole silently away while cellini

hurried away to the foundry  followed by his workmen  and shouting like

a madman   



 to the casting  children  to the casting  









xii





of the difficulty which an honest man experiences

in procuring his own committal

to prison





poor jacques aubry was in a frame of mind bordering on despair when he

left the grand nesle  there could be no doubt that it was he who 

involuntarily to be sure  had betrayed ascanio s secret  but who was the

man who had betrayed him  surely not that gallant nobleman whose name he

did not know  ah  no  he was a gentleman  it must have been that knave

of a henriot  unless it was robin  or chariot  or guillaume  to tell the

truth  poor aubry rather lost himself in his conjectures  for the fact

was that he had intrusted the secret to a dozen or more intimate

friends  among whom it was no easy matter to find the culprit  but no

matter  the first  the real traitor was himself  jacques aubry   the

infamous spy so roundly denounced by benvenuto was himself  instead of

locking away in his heart his friend s secret which he had surprised  he

had spread it broadcast in a score of places  and had brought disaster

upon his brother ascanio with his infernal tongue  jacques tore his

hair  jacques beat himself with his fists  jacques heaped mortal insults

upon himself  and could find no invectives sufficiently bitter to

qualify his conduct as it deserved 



his remorse became so keen  and threw him into such a state of

exasperation with himself  that  for the first time in his life perhaps 

jacques aubry indulged in reflection  after all  when his head should be

bald  his chest black and blue  and his conscience torn to rags  ascanio

would be no nearer freedom  at any cost  he must repair the evil he had

done  instead of wasting his time in despairing 



honest jacques had retained these words of benvenuto   i would give ten

years of my life to the man who would gain admission to the prisoner 

speak to him  and learn the secret by means of which i may subdue that

arrogant duchess   and  as we have said  he began to reflect  contrary

to his wont  the result of his reflections was that he must gain

admission to the châtelet  once there  he would find a way to reach

ascanio 



but benvenuto had sought in vain to gain admission as a visitor  and

surely jacques aubry could never be so audacious as to think of

attempting a thing in which the master had failed  however  although it

might be impossible to effect an entrance as a visitor  it certainly

should be much easier  at least so the student thought  to be admitted

as a prisoner  he determined  therefore  to enter the châtelet in that

character  then  when he had seen ascanio  and ascanio had told him all 

so that he had no further business at the châtelet  he would take his

leave  rich in the possession of the precious secret  and would go to

benvenuto  not to demand the ten years of his life that he offered  but

to confess his crime  and implore forgiveness 



delighted with the fecundity of his imagination  and proud of his

unexampled devotion  he bent his steps toward the châtelet 



 let us see   he ruminated  as he walked with deliberate step toward the

prison where all his hopes were centred    let us see  in order to avoid

any more idiotic mistakes  how matters stand   no easy task  considering

that the whole business seems to me as tangled as gervaise s skein when

she gives it to me to hold  and i try to kiss her  let s begin at the

beginning  ascanio loved colombe  the provost s daughter  so far  so

good  as the provost proposed to marry her to comte d orbec  ascanio

carried her off  very good  not knowing what to do with the sweet child

when he had abducted her  he hid her in the head of the statue of mars 

best of all  faith  it was a wonderfully ingenious hiding place  and

nothing less than a beast  but let us pass over that  i shall find

myself again later  thereupon it would seem that the provost  acting

upon my information  got his daughter into his clutches once more  and

imprisoned ascanio  triple brute that i am  but here is where the skein

begins to be tangled  what interest has the duchesse d etampes in all

this  she detests colombe  whom everybody else loves  why  ah  i know 

i remember certain jocose remarks of the apprentices  ascanio s

embarrassment when the duchess was mentioned   madame d etampes has her

eye on ascanio  and naturally abominates her rival  jacques  my friend 

you are a miserable wretch  but you are a clever dog all the same  ah 

yes  but now how does it happen that ascanio has in his hands the means

of ruining the duchess  why does the king appear at intervals in the

affair  with one stefana  why did benvenuto constantly invoke jupiter 

rather a heathenish invocation for a catholic  deuce take me if i can

see through all that  but it isn t absolutely necessary that i should

understand  light is to be found in ascanio s cell  therefore the most

essential thing is to get myself cast into the cell with him  i will

manage the rest afterward  



as he thus communed with himself he reached his destination  and struck

a violent blow upon the great door of the châtelet  the wicket opened 

and a harsh voice demanded to know his business  it was the jailer s 



 i wish for a cell in your prison   replied aubry in a hollow voice 



 a cell   exclaimed the astonished jailer 



 yes  a cell  the blackest and deepest  even that will be better than i

deserve  



 why so  



 because i am a great criminal  



 what crime have you committed  



 ah  indeed  what crime have i committed   jacques asked himself  for he

had not thought of preparing a crime suited to the occasion  as a

fertile  lively imagination was not his most prominent characteristic 

notwithstanding the compliments he had addressed to himself just before 

he repeated  stupidly   



 what crime  



 yes  what crime  



 guess   said jacques   this fellow ought to know more about crimes than

i do   he added to himself   so i will let him give me a list  and then

make my selection  



 have you murdered anybody   asked the jailer 



 great god  what do you take me for  my friend   cried the student 

whose conscience rose in revolt at the thought of being taken for a

murderer 



 have you stolen anything   continued the jailer 



 stolen  the idea  



 what in heaven s name have you done then   cried the jailer testily 

 to give yourself up as a criminal isn t all that is necessary  you

must say what crime you ve committed  



 but i tell you that i m a villain  a vile wretch  and that i deserve

the wheel or the gallows  



 the crime  the crime   the jailer repeated 



 the crime  well  i have betrayed my friend  



 that s no crime   said the jailer   good night   and he closed the

wicket 



 that s not a crime  you say  that s not a crime  what is it then 

pray  



and jacques grasped the knocker with both hands  and knocked with all

his strength 



 what s the matter  what s the matter   said a different voice from

within the châtelet 



 it s a madman  who wants to be admitted into the prison   replied the

jailer 



 if he s a madman  his place is not at the châtelet  but at the

asylum  



 at the asylum   cried aubry  scampering away as fast as his legs would

carry him   at the asylum  peste  that s not what i want  i want to get

into the châtelet  not the asylum  besides  paupers and beggars are

sent to the asylum  and not people who have twenty paris sous in their

pocket as i have  the asylum  why  that wretched jailer claims that to

betray one s friend is no crime  so it seems that  in order to have the

honor of being committed to prison one must have murdered or stolen  but

now i think of it   why might i not have led some young girl astray 

there s nothing dishonorable about that  very good  but what girl 

gervaise  



despite his preoccupation  the student roared with laughter 



 but  after all   he said   though it isn t so  it might have been 

good  good  i have discovered my crime  i seduced gervaise  



on the instant he set off for the young working girl s home  ran up the

sixty stairs which led to her lodgings  and burst into the room where

the lovely grisette in a coquettish  négligé  was ironing her linen 



 ah   exclaimed gervaise  with a fascinating little shriek   ah 

monsieur  you frightened me  



 gervaise  my dear gervaise   cried aubry  rushing toward her with open

arms   you must save my life  my child  



 one moment  one moment   said gervaise  using the hot flat iron as a

shield   what do you want  master gadabout  for three days i haven t

seen you  



 i have done wrong  gervaise  i am an unfortunate wretch  but a sure

proof that i love you is that i run to you in my distress  i repeat it 

gervaise  you must save my life  



 yes  i understand  you have been getting tipsy in some wine shop  and

have had a dispute with some one  the archers are after you to put you

in prison  and you come to poor gervaise to give you shelter  go to

prison  monsieur  go to prison  and leave me in peace  



 that is just what i ask and all i ask  my little gervaise   to go to

prison  but the villains refuse to commit me  



 o mon dieu  jacques   said the young woman compassionately   have you

gone mad  



 there you are  they say that i am mad  and propose to send me to the

asylum  while the châtelet is where i want to go  



 you want to go to the châtelet  what for  aubry  the châtelet s a

frightful prison  they say that when one gets in there  it s impossible

to say when one will come out  



 i must get in there  however  i must   cried the student   there is no

other way to save him  



 to save whom  



 ascanio  



 ascanio  what  that handsome young fellow  your benvenuto s pupil  



 himself  gervaise  he is in the châtelet  and he s there by my fault  



 great god  



 so that i must join him there   said jacques   and save him  



 why is he in the châtelet  



 because he loved the provost s daughter  and seduced her  



 poor boy  why  do they imprison men for that  



 yes  gervaise  how you see it was like this  he had her in hiding  i

discovered the hiding place  and  like an idiot  like an infamous

villain  i told the whole story to everybody  



 except me   cried gervaise   that was just like you  



 didn t i tell it to you  gervaise  



 you didn t mention it  you re a great babbler with others  but not

with me  when you come here it s to kiss me  to drink  or to

sleep   never to talk  understand  monsieur  that a woman loves to

talk  



 well  what are we doing at this moment  my little gervaise   said

jacques   we are talking  i should say  



 yes  because you need me  



 it is true that you could do me a great service  



 what is it  



 you could say that i seduced you  



 why  of course you seduced me  you wretch  



 i   cried jacques in amazement   i seduced you  gervaise  



 alas  yes  that is the word  seduced  monsieur  shamelessly seduced by

your fine words  by your false promises  



 by my fine words and false promises  



 yes  didn t you tell me i was the prettiest girl in the whole quarter

of saint germain des prés  



 i tell you that now  



 didn t you say that  if i didn t love you  you should die of love  



 do you think i said that  it s strange i don t remember it  



 while  on the contrary  if i did love you  you would marry me  



 gervaise  i didn t say that  never  



 you did say it  monsieur  



 never  never  never  gervaise  my father made me take an oath like

hannibal s to hamilcar  



 what was that  



 he made me swear to die a bachelor  like himself  



 oh   cried gervaise  summoning tears to the assistance of her words

with a woman s marvellous power of weeping to order   oh  you re like

all the rest  promises cost nothing  and when the poor girl is seduced

they forget what they promised  i will take my turn at swearing now  and

swear that i will never be caught again  



 and you will do well  gervaise   said the student 



 when one thinks   cried the grisette   that there are laws for robbers

and cut purses  and none for the scoundrels who ruin poor girls  



 but there are  gervaise  



 there are  



 why  of course  didn t i tell you that they sent poor ascanio to the

châtelet for seducing colombe  



 they did well  too   said gervaise  to whom the loss of her honor had

never presented itself so forcibly until she was fully convinced that

jacques aubry was determined not to give her his name by way of

compensation   yes  they did well  and i wish you were in the châtelet

with him  



 mon dieu  that s all i ask   cried the student   and as i told you  my

little gervaise  i rely upon you to put me there  



 you rely upon me  



 yes  



 make sport of me  ingrate  



 i m not making sport of you  gervaise  i say that if you had the

courage   



 to do what  



 accuse me before the judge  



 of what  



 of having seduced you  but you would never dare  



 what s that  i wouldn t dare   cried gervaise in an injured tone    i

wouldn t dare to tell the truth  



 consider that you would have to make oath to it  gervaise  



 i ll do it  



 you will make oath that i seduced you  



 yes  yes   a hundred times yes  



 then all goes well   said the student joyfully   i confess i was

afraid  an oath is a serious matter  



 i ll take my oath to it this instant  and send you to the châtelet 

monsieur  



 good  



 and you will find your ascanio there  



 splendid  



 and you will have all the time you need to do penance together  



 it s all that i ask  



 where is the lieutenant criminal  



 at the palais de justice  



 i will go there at once  



 let us go together  gervaise  



 yes  together  in that way the punishment will follow at once  



 take my arm  gervaise  



 come  monsieur  



they set off toward the palais de justice at the same gait at which they

were accustomed to repair on sundays to the pré aux clercs or the butte

montmartre 



as they drew near the temple of themis  as jacques aubry poetically

called the edifice in question  gervaise s pace slackened perceptibly 

when they reached the foot of the staircase  she had some difficulty in

ascending  and finally  at the door of the lieutenant criminal s

sanctum  her legs failed her altogether  and the student felt her whole

weight hanging upon his arm 



 well  gervaise   said he   is your courage giving out  



 no   said gervaise   but a lieutenant criminal is an appalling

creature  



 pardieu  he s a man like other men  



 true  but one must tell him things   



 very well  tell them  



 but i must swear  



 then swear  



 jacques   said gervaise   are you quite sure that you seduced me  



 am i sure of it   said jacques   pardieu  besides  didn t you just

insist upon it yourself that i did  



 yes  that is true  but  strangely enough  i don t seem to see things

now in just the same light that i did a short time ago  



 come  come   said jacques   you are weakening already  i knew you

would  



 jacques  my dear   cried gervaise   take me back to the house  



 gervaise  gervaise   said the student   this isn t what you promised

me  



 jacques  i will never reproach you again  or say a word about it  i

loved you because you took my fancy  that s all  



 alas   said the student   this is what i feared  but it s too late  



 how too late  



 you came here to accuse me  and accuse me you must  



 never  jacques  never  you didn t seduce me  jacques  i was a flirt  



 nonsense   cried the student 



 besides   added gervaise  lowering her eyes   one can be seduced but

once  



 what do you mean  



 the first time one loves  



 hoity toity  and you made me believe that you had never loved  



 jacques  take me back to the house  



 oh indeed i won t   said jacques  exasperated by her refusal  and by

the reason she gave for it   no  no  no  



and he knocked at the magistrate s door 



 what are you doing   cried gervaise 



 you see  i am knocking  



 come in   cried a nasal voice 



 i will not go in   exclaimed gervaise  doing her utmost to release her

arm from the student s   i will not go in  



 come in   said the same voice a second time  a little more

emphatically 



 jacques  i will shriek  i will call for help   said gervaise 



 come in  i say   said the voice a third time  nearer at hand  and at

the same moment the door opened 



 well  what do you want   said a tall thin man dressed in black  the

mere sight of whom made gervaise tremble from head to foot 



 mademoiselle here   said aubry   has come to enter complaint against a

knave who has seduced her  



with that he pushed gervaise into the black  filthy closet  which served

as an anteroom to the lieutenant criminal s office  the door closed

behind her as if by a spring 



gervaise gave a feeble shriek  half terror  half surprise  and sat down 

or rather fell  upon a stool which stood against the wall 



jacques aubry  meanwhile  lest she should call him back  or run after

him  hurried away through corridors known only to law students and

advocates  until he reached the courtyard of sainte chapelle  thence he

tranquilly pursued his way to pont saint michel  which it was absolutely

certain that gervaise must cross 



half an hour later she appeared 



 well   said he  running to meet her   what happened  



 alas   said gervaise   you made me tell a monstrous lie  but i hope god

will forgive me for it in view of my good intention  



 i ll take it upon myself   said aubry   tell me what happened  



 do you fancy that i know   said gervaise   i was so ashamed that i

hardly remember what it was all about  all i know is that the lieutenant

criminal questioned me  and that i answered his questions sometimes yes 

sometimes no  but i am not sure that i answered as i should  



 wretched girl   cried aubry   i believe it will turn out that she

accused herself of seducing me  



 oh  no  i don t think i went as far as that  



 at least they have my address  haven t they  so that they can summon

me  



 yes   murmured gervaise   i gave it to them  



 it s all right then   said aubry   and now let us hope that god will do

the rest  



having escorted gervaise to her abode and comforted her as best he could

for the false testimony she had been compelled to give  jacques aubry

returned home  overflowing with faith in providence 



in fact  whether providence took a hand in it  or chance did it all 

jacques aubry received the next morning a summons to appear before the

lieutenant criminal that same day 



this summons fulfilled aubry s dearest hopes  and yet a court of justice

is so redoubtable a place that he felt a shiver run through his veins as

he read it  but we hasten to say that the certainty of seeing ascanio

again  and the longing to save the friend upon whom he had brought

disaster  soon put an end to this demonstration of weakness on our

student s part 



the summons fixed the hour of noon  and it was only nine o clock  so he

called upon gervaise  whom he found no less agitated than on the

previous day 



 well   said she  inquiringly 



 well   repeated jacques triumphantly  exhibiting the paper covered with

hieroglyphics which he held in his hand   here it is  



 for what hour  



 noon  that s all i was able to read  



 then you don t know what you re accused of  



 why  of seducing you  my little gervaise  i presume  



 you won t forget that you yourself insisted upon my doing it  



 why no  i am ready to give you a certificate that you utterly refused

to do it  



 then you bear me no ill will for obeying you  



 on the contrary  i couldn t be more grateful to you  



 whatever happens  



 whatever happens  



 if i did say all that  it was because i was obliged to  



 of course  



 and if  in my confusion  i said more than i meant to say  you will

forgive me  



 not only will i forgive you  my dear  my divine gervaise  but i do

forgive you now in advance  



 ah   said gervaise  with a sigh   ah  bad boy  with such words as those

you turned my head  



from which it is easy to see that gervaise had really been seduced 



at a quarter before twelve jacques aubry remembered that his summons

bade him appear at twelve  he took leave of gervaise  and as he had a

long distance to go he ran all the way  twelve o clock was striking as

he knocked at the lieutenant criminal s door 



 come in   cried the same nasal voice 



he was not called upon to repeat the invitation  for jacques aubry  with

a smile on his lips  his nose in the air  and his cap over his ear  at

once stood in the tall black coated man s presence 



 what is your name   asked the tall man 



 jacques aubry   replied the student 



 what are you  



 law student  



 what have you been doing  



 seducing girls  



 aha  you re the man against whom a complaint was lodged yesterday

by  by   



 by gervaise perrette popinot  



 very good  sit down yonder and await your turn  



jacques sat down as the man in black bade him do  and waited 



five or six persons of varying age  sex  and feature were waiting like

himself  and as they had arrived before him their turns naturally came

before his  some of them went out alone   they were the ones  doubtless 

against whom no sufficient evidence was adduced   while others went out

accompanied by an exempt  or by two of the provost s guards  jacques

aubry envied the fortune of these latter  for they were being taken to

the châtelet  to which he was so anxious to be admitted 



at last the name of jacques aubry  student  was called  jacques aubry

instantly rose and rushed into the magistrate s office as joyously as if

he were on his way to the most agreeable of entertainments 



there were two men in the lieutenant criminal s sanctum  one taller 

thinner  and more forbidding than he in the antechamber  which jacques

aubry would have deemed impossible five minutes earlier  this was the

clerk  the other was short  fat  coarse  with a cheerful eye  a smiling

mouth  and a jovial expression generally  this was the magistrate 



aubry s smile and his met  and the student was quite ready to grasp his

hand  so strongly conscious was he of the existence of a bond of

sympathy between them 



 ha  ha  ha   laughed the lieutenant criminal  as he caught the

student s eye 



 faith  that is true  messire   the student rejoined 



 you seem a jolly dog   said the magistrate   come  master knave  take a

chair and sit you down  



jacques aubry took a chair  sat down  threw one leg over the other and

swung it in high glee 



 ah   exclaimed the lieutenant  rubbing his hands   master clerk  let us

look over the complainant s deposition  



the clerk rose  and  by virtue of his great height  readied over to the

other side of the table  and selected the documents concerning jacques

aubry from a pile of papers 



 here it is   he said 



 who lodges the complaint   inquired the magistrate 



 gervaise perrette popinot   said the clerk 



 that s it   said the student  nodding his head violently   that s the

one  



 a minor   said the clerk   nineteen years of age  



 oho  a minor   exclaimed aubry 



 so it appears from her declaration  



 poor gervaise   muttered aubry   she was quite right when she said that

she was so confused she didn t know what answers she made  she has

confessed to twenty two  however  nineteen it is  



 and so   said the lieutenant criminal   and so  my buck  you are

charged with seducing a minor child  ha  ha  ha  



 ha  ha  ha   echoed aubry  joining in the judge s hilarity 



 with aggravating circumstances   continued the clerk  mingling his

yelping tones with the jovial voices of the magistrate and the student 



 with aggravating circumstances   repeated the former 



 the devil   exclaimed jacques   i should like very much to know what

they were  



 as the complainant remained deaf to all the entreaties and wiles of the

accused for six months   



 for six months   jacques interposed   pardon  monsieur  i think there s

a mistake there  



 for six months  monsieur  so it is written   replied the man in black 

in a tone which admitted no rejoinder 



 so be it  six months it is   said jacques   but in truth gervaise was

quite right when she said   



 the said jacques aubry  angered by her coldness  threatened her   



 oh  oh   exclaimed jacques 



 oh  oh   echoed the judge 



 but   the clerk read on   the said gervaise perrette popinot held out

so stubbornly and courageously that the insolent fellow begged her

forgiveness in view of his sincere repentance  



 ah  ah   muttered aubry 



 ah  ah   exclaimed the magistrate 



 poor gervaise   aubry continued  speaking to himself  with a shrug 

 what was the matter with her head  



 but   continued the clerk   his repentance was only feigned 

unfortunately  the complainant  in her innocence and purity  allowed

herself to be deceived by it  and one evening  when she was imprudent

enough to accept refreshments of which the accused invited her to

partake  the said jacques aubry mixed with her water   



 with her water   the student interrupted 



 the complainant declared that she never drinks wine   said the

clerk    the said jacques aubry mixed an intoxicating decoction with her

water  



 look you  master clerk   cried aubry   what the deuce are you reading

from  



 the complainant s deposition  



 impossible  



 is it so written   inquired the magistrate 



 it is written  



 go on  



 after all   said aubry aside   the more guilty i am  the surer i shall

be of being sent to join ascanio at the châtelet  intoxicating

decoction it is  go on  master clerk  



 you confess  do you   queried the judge 



 i confess   said the student 



 ah  gallows bird   exclaimed the judge  roaring with laughter  and

rubbing his hands 



 so that   continued the clerk   poor gervaise  bereft of her reason 

ended by confessing to her seducer that she loved him  



 aha   said jacques 



 lucky knave   murmured the lieutenant criminal  whose little eyes

shone 



 why   cried aubry   why  there isn t a word of truth in the whole of

it  



 you deny the charge  



 absolutely  



 write   said the magistrate   that the accused declares that he is not

guilty of any of the charges brought against him  



 wait a moment  wait a moment   cried the student  who reflected that if

he denied his guilt  they would not send him to prison 



 so you don t deny it altogether   queried the judge 



 i confess that there is some little truth  not in the form  but in the

substance  



 oh  as you have confessed to the decoction   said the judge   you may

as well admit the results  



 true   said jacques   as i ve confessed to the decoction  i admit the

rest  master clerk  but  upon my word   he added in an undertone 

 gervaise was quite right in saying   



 but that s not all   the clerk interrupted him 



 what  that s not all  



 the crime of which the accused was guilty had terrible results  the

unhappy gervaise discovered that she was about to become a mother  



 ah  that is too much   cried jacques 



 do you deny the paternity   asked the judge 



 not only do i deny the paternity  but i deny the condition  



 write   said the judge   that the accused denies the paternity  and

also denies the condition  an inquiry will be ordered on that point  



 one moment  one moment   cried aubry  realizing that if gervaise were

convicted of falsehood on a single point the whole structure would fall

to the ground   did gervaise really say what the clerk has read  



 she said it word for word   replied the clerk 



 then if she said it   continued aubry   if she said it  why   



 well   queried the lieutenant criminal 



 why  it must be so  



 write that the accused pleads guilty to all the charges  



the clerk wrote as directed 



 pardieu   said the student to himself   if ascanio deserves a week in

the châtelet for simply paying court to colombe  i  who have deceived

gervaise  drugged her  and seduced her  can count upon three months 

incarceration at the very least  but  faith  i would like to be sure of

my facts  however  i must congratulate gervaise  peste  she kept to her

word  and jeanne d arc was nowhere beside her  



 so you confess to all the crimes you re accused of   said the judge 



 i do  messire   replied jacques unhesitatingly   i do  all of them and

more too  if you choose  i am a great sinner  monsieur le lieutenant

criminel  don t spare me  



 impudent varlet   muttered the magistrate  in the tone in which the

uncle of comedy speaks to his nephew   impudent varlet  out upon you  



with that he let his great round head  with his bloated  purple face 

fall upon his breast  and reflected magisterially 



 whereas   he began  after meditating a few moments  raising his head 

and lifting the index finger of his right hand    write  master

clerk   whereas jacques aubry  clerk of the basoche  has pleaded guilty

to the charge of seducing one gervaise perrette popinot by fine promises

and simulated affection  we sentence said jacques aubry to pay a fine of

twenty paris sous  to support the child  if it is a boy  and to pay the

costs  



 and the imprisonment   cried aubry 



 imprisonment  what do you mean   asked the judge 



 why  i mean the imprisonment  for heaven s sake  aren t you going to

sentence me to prison  



 no  



 you re not going to order me committed to the châtelet as ascanio

was  



 who s ascanio  



 ascanio is a pupil of master benvenuto cellini  



 what did he do  



 he seduced a maid  



 who was she  



 mademoiselle colombe d estourville  daughter of the provost of paris  



 what then  



 what then  why i say that it s unjust  when we both committed the same

crime  to make a distinction in the punishment  what  you send him to

prison and fine me twenty paris sous  in god s name  is there no justice

in this world  



 on the contrary   rejoined the magistrate   it is because there is

justice in this world  and enlightened justice too  that this is as it

is  



 how so  



 there are honors and honors  my young rascal  the honor of a noble

maiden is valued at imprisonment  the honor of a grisette is worth

twenty paris sous  if you want to go to the châtelet  you must try your

arts on a duchess  and then the affair will take care of itself  



 but this is frightful  immoral  outrageous   cried the student 



 my dear friend   said the judge   pay your fine and begone  



 i won t pay my fine  and i won t go  



 then i shall call a couple of archers and commit you to prison until

you do pay it  



 that s all i ask  



the judge summoned two guards   



 take this scoundrel to the grands carmes  



 the grands carmes   cried jacques   why not the châtelet  pray  



 because the châtelet is not a debtor s prison  my friend  because the

châtelet is a royal fortress  and one must have committed some heinous

crime to be sent there  the châtelet  ah  yes  my little fellow  you ll

get to the châtelet soon enough  just wait  



 one moment   said aubry   one moment  



 what is it  



 if i am not to be sent to the châtelet  i will pay  



 very well  if you pay  there s nothing more to be said  you may go  you

fellows  the young man will pay  



the archers went out and jacques aubry took from his wallet twenty paris

sous  which he spread out in a line on the judge s desk 



 see if that is right   said the lieutenant criminal 



the clerk rose  and to execute the order bent his back like a how 

embracing in the half circle described by his body  which seemed to

possess the power of lengthening itself out indefinitely  his table and

the papers which lay upon it  as he stood with his feet on the floor and

his hands on the judge s desk  he reminded one of a sombre hued rainbow 



 it is right   he said 



 then off with you  my young rascal   said the magistrate   and give

place to others  the court has no more time to waste on you  go  



jacques saw that he had nothing to gain by remaining there  and withdrew

in despair 









xiii





in which jacques aubry rises to epic

proportions





 well  upon my word   said the student to himself as he left the palais

de justice  and mechanically crossed the pont aux moulins  which brought

him out almost opposite the châtelet   upon my word  i am curious to

know what gervaise will say when she learns that her honor is valued at

twenty paris sous  she will say that i have been indiscreet  and told

things i shouldn t have told  and she ll tear my eyes out  but what do

i see yonder  



what the student saw was a page belonging to the amiable nobleman to

whom he was accustomed to confide his secrets  and whom he looked upon

as one of his dearest friends  the boy was leaning up against the

parapet of the bridge and amusing himself by performing sleight of hand

tricks with pebbles 



 pardieu   said the student   this happens very fortunately  my friend 

whose name i don t know  and who seems to stand extremely well at court 

may have influence enough to have me committed to prison  providence

sends his page to me to tell me where i can find him  as i know neither

his name nor his address  



in order to avail himself of what he considered a direct interposition

of providence in his behalf  jacques aubry advanced toward the young

page  who likewise recognized him  and  letting his three pebbles fall

into the same hand  crossed his legs and awaited the student with that

knowing look which is especially characteristic of the profession to

which he had the honor to belong 



  bon jour   monsieur le page   cried aubry from the most distant point

at which he thought the boy could hear his voice 



  bon jour   seigneur student   was the reply   what are you doing in

this quarter  



 faith  if i must tell you  i was looking for something which i think i

have found  now that i see you  i was seeking the address of my

excellent friend  the comte  the baron  the vicomte  your master s

address  



 do you wish to see him   asked the page 



 instantly  if possible  



 in that case you will have your wish in a moment  for he is calling on

the provost  



 at the châtelet  



 yes  he will come out directly  



 he s very lucky to be admitted to the châtelet when he wishes  but is

my friend the vicomte  the comte  the baron   



 vicomte  



 on intimate terms with messire robert d estourville  the vicomte de  

tell me   continued aubry  anxious to avail himself of the opportunity

to learn his friend s name at last   the vicomte de   



 the vicomte de mar   



 ah   cried the student  interrupting the page in the middle of the

word  as he saw the man he sought appear at the door   ah  my dear

viscount  there you are  i was looking for you and waiting for you  



  bon jour    said marmagne  evidently but little pleased at the

meeting    bon jour   my dear fellow  i would be glad to talk with you 

but unfortunately i am very hurried  so adieu  



 one moment  one moment   cried jacques  clinging to his friend s arm 

 deuce take me  you won t leave me like this  in the first place i have

a very great favor to ask of you  



 you  



 yes  i  and god s law  you know  bids friends to succor one another  



 friends  



 to be sure  aren t you my friend  what constitutes friendship 

confidence  now i am full of confidence in you  i tell you all my own

business  and other people s too  



 have you ever had occasion to repent of your confidence  



 never  so far as you are concerned at least  but it s not so with

everybody  there is one man in paris that i am looking for  and with

god s help i shall meet him some day  



 my dear fellow   interrupted marmagne  who had a shrewd suspicion who

the man was   i told you that i was much hurried  



 but wait a moment  pray  when i tell you that you can do me a great

service  



 well  speak quickly  



 you stand well at court  do you not  



 my friends say so  



 you have some influence then  



 my enemies may discover it to their cost  



 very good  now my dear comte  my dear baron  my dear   



 vicomte  



 help me to get into the châtelet  



 in what capacity  



 as a prisoner  



 as a prisoner  that s a singular ambition  on my word  



 as you please  but it s my ambition  



 for what purpose do you wish to be committed to the châtelet   queried

marmagne  who suspected that this strange desire on the part of the

student indicated some new secret which it might be to his advantage to

know 



 to any other than you i wouldn t tell it  my good friend   replied

jacques   or i have learned to my cost  or rather to poor ascanio s 

that i must learn to hold my tongue  but with you it s a different

matter  you know that i have no secrets from you  



 in that case tell me quickly  



 will you have me committed to the châtelet if i tell you  



 instantly  



 well  my friend  imagine that i was idiot enough to confide to others

than yourself the fact that i had seen a lovely girl in the head of the

statue of mars  



 what then  



 the crack brained fools  would you believe that they spread the story

so that it came to the provost s ears  and as the provost had lost his

daughter some days before  he suspected that it was she who had selected

that hiding place  he notified d orbec and the duchesse d etampes  they

came to the hôtel de nesle to make a domiciliary visit while benvenuto

cellini was at fontainebleau  they carried off colombe and imprisoned

ascanio  



 nonsense  



 it s as i tell you  my dear viscount  and who managed it all  a certain

vicomte de marmagne  



 but   interposed the viscount  not at all pleased to hear his name upon

the student s lips   you don t tell me why you want to be committed to

the châtelet  



 you don t understand  



 no  



 they arrested ascanio  



 yes  



 and took him to the châtelet  



 very good  



 but what they don t know  and what nobody knows save the duchesse

d etampes  benvenuto  and myself  is that ascanio possesses a certain

letter  a certain secret  which places the duchess in his power  now do

you understand  



 yes i begin to see light  but do you help me  my dear friend  



 you see  viscount   continued aubry  assuming a more and more

aristocratic air   i want to be admitted to the châtelet  get to

ascanio s cell  take the letter or learn the secret  leave the prison

again  go to benvenuto and arrange with him some method whereby

colombe s virtue and ascanio s love may triumph  to the confusion of the

marmagnes and d orbecs  the provost  the duchesse d etampes  and the

whole clique  



 that s a very ingenious plan   said marmagne 



 thanks for your confidence  my dear student  you shall have no reason

to regret it  



 do you promise me your assistance  



 to what end  



 why  to help me get committed to the châtelet  as i asked you  



 rely upon me  



 immediately  



 wait here for me  



 where i am  



 in this same spot  



 and you  



 i am going to get the order for your arrest  



 ah  my friend  my dear baron  my dear count  but you must tell me your

name and address in case i may need you  



 useless  i will return at once  



 yes  return as soon as possible  and if you chance to meet that

accursed marmagne on the road  tell him   



 what  



 tell him that i have sworn an oath that he shall die by no hand but

mine  



 adieu   cried the viscount   adieu  and wait here for me  



  au revoir    said aubry   i will expect you soon  ah  you are a friend

indeed  a man one can trust  and i would be glad to know   



 adieu  seigneur student   said the page  who had stood aloof during

this conversation  and was now about to follow his master 



 adieu  my pretty page   said aubry   but before you leave me do me a

favor  



 what is it  



 who is this gallant nobleman to whom you have the honor to belong  



 he whom you ve been talking with for the last fifteen minutes  



 the same  



 and whom you call friend  



 yes  



 you don t know his name  



 no  



 why  he is   



 a very well known nobleman  is he not  



 to be sure  



 and influential  



 next to the king and the duchesse d etampes  he s the man  



 ah  and his name you say is   



 he is the vicomte de  but he is turning back and calling me 

pardon   



 the vicomte de   



 the vicomte de marmagne  



 marmagne   cried aubry   vicomte de marmagne  that young gentleman is

the vicomte de marmagne  



 himself  



 marmagne  the friend of the provost and d orbec and madame d etampes  



 in person  



 and the enemy of benvenuto cellini  



 just so  



 ah   exclaimed aubry  to whom the whole past was revealed as by a flash

of lightning   ah  i understand now  o marmagne  marmagne  



as the student was unarmed  with a movement as swift as thought  he

seized the page s short sword by the hilt  drew it from its sheath  and

darted in pursuit of marmagne  shouting   halt  



at his first shout  marmagne  decidedly ill at ease  looked around  and 

seeing aubry rushing after him sword in hand  suspected that he was

discovered  to stand his ground or fly was therefore the only

alternative  marmagne was not quite courageous enough to stand his

ground  nor was he quite enough of a coward to fly  he therefore adopted

the intermediate course of darting into a house  the door of which stood

open  hoping to close the door behind him  but unluckily for him it was

held fast to the wall by a chain which he could not detach  so that

aubry  who was some little distance behind him  was in the little

courtyard before he had time to reach the staircase 



 ah  marmagne  you damned viscount  you infernal spy  you filcher of

secrets  it s you  is it  at last i know you  and have my hand on you 

on guard  villain  on guard  



 monsieur   replied marmagne  trying to assume a lordly bearing   do you

imagine that the vicomte de marmagne will honor the student jacques

aubry by crossing swords with him  



 if the vicomte de marmagne will not honor jacques aubry by crossing

swords with him  jacques aubry will have the honor of passing his sword

through the vicomte de marmagne s body  



to leave no doubt in the mind of him to whom this threat was addressed 

jacques aubry placed the point of his sword against the viscount s

breast  and let him feel the touch of the cold steel through his

doublet 



 murder   cried marmagne   help  help  



 oh  shout as much as you choose   retorted jacques   you will have done

shouting before any one comes  and so the best thing you can do 

viscount  is to defend yourself  on guard  viscount  on guard  



 if you will have it so   cried the viscount   wait a bit  and you will

see  



marmagne  as the reader will have discovered ere this  was not naturally

brave  but like all noblemen of that chivalrous epoch he had received a

military education  furthermore  he was reputed to have some skill in

fencing  it is true that this reputation was said to result rather in

enabling him to avoid unpleasant encounters which he might have had 

than in bringing to a fortunate conclusion those which he did have  it

is none the less true that  being closely pressed by jacques  he drew

his sword and stood on guard in the most approved style of the art 



but if marmagne s skill was recognized among the noblemen at court 

jacques aubry s address was accepted as an incontestable fact among the

students at the university and the clerks of the basoche  the result

was  that the moment their swords crossed each of the combatants saw

that he had to do with no despicable opponent  but marmagne had one

great advantage  the page s sword  which aubry had taken  was six inches

shorter than the viscount s  this was no great disadvantage in defensive

work  but became a serious matter when he wished to assume the

offensive  furthermore  marmagne was six inches taller than the student 

and being armed with a sword as much longer he had simply to present the

point at his face to keep him at a distance  while jacques cut and

thrust and feinted to no purpose  marmagne  without retreating a step 

got out of reach simply by drawing his right leg back beside the left 

the consequence was that  despite aubry s agility  the viscount s long

sword grazed his chest several times  while he could succeed in cutting

nothing more substantial than the air  try as hard as he would 



aubry realized that he was lost if he continued to play the same game 

but in order to give his opponent no idea of the plan he proposed to

adopt  he continued to thrust and parry in the ordinary way  gaining

ground imperceptibly inch by inch  when he thought he was sufficiently

near he allowed himself to be caught off guard as if through

awkwardness  marmagne  seeing an opening  made a lunge  but aubry was

ready for him  he parried the blow  and  taking advantage of the

position of his opponent s sword  two inches above his head  darted

under it  leaped upon him  and thrust as he leaped  so cleverly and so

vigorously that the page s short sword disappeared up to the hilt in the

viscount s breast 



marmagne uttered one of those shrill cries  which indicate a severe

wound  his hand fell to his side  the blood left his cheeks  and he fell

headlong to the ground 



at that moment the patrol came running up  attracted by marmagne s

shrieks  the gestures of the page  and the sight of the crowd in front

of the door  as aubry still held his bloody sword in his hand  they

arrested him 



aubry undertook at first to make some resistance  but as the leader of

the patrol shouted   disarm the villain and take him to the châtelet  

he gave up his sword  and followed the guards to the prison to which he

was so anxious to gain admission  marvelling at the merciful decrees of

providence  which accorded him at the same time the two things he most

desired   vengeance upon marmagne  and access to ascanio 



this time no objection was made to his reception within the walls of the

royal fortress  but as it seemed that it was at the moment somewhat

overburdened with guests  there was a long discussion between the jailer

and the warden of the prison  as to where the new comer should be

lodged  at last the two worthies seemed to agree upon the point  the

jailer motioned to aubry to follow him  led him down thirty two steps 

opened a door  pushed him into a very dark dungeon  and closed the door

behind him 









xiv





of the difficulty which an honest man experiences

in securing his release from prison





the student stood for an instant blinded by the abrupt transition from

light to darkness  where was he  he had no idea  was he near ascanio or

far from him  he knew not  in the corridor through which he had passed 

he had noticed but two other doors beside the one which was opened for

him  but his primary object was gained  he was under the same roof as

his friend 



meanwhile  as he could not spend the rest of his life in that one spot 

and as he could see at the other end of the dungeon  about fifteen feet

away  a faint ray of light struggling in through an air hole  he

cautiously put forth his leg  with the instinctive purpose of walking to

that spot  but at the second step that he took the floor seemed suddenly

to give way under his feet  he plunged down three or four stairs  and

would doubtless have gone head foremost against the wall had not his

feet come in contact with some object which tripped him up  the result

was that he escaped with nothing worse than a few bruises 



the object which had unwittingly rendered him so important a service 

uttered a hollow groan 



 i beg your pardon   said jacques  rising and politely removing his cap 

 it seems that i stepped upon some person or some thing  a rudeness of

which i should never have been guilty  if i had been able to see

clearly  



 you stepped   said a voice   upon what was for sixty years a man  but

is soon to become a corpse for all eternity  



 in that case   said jacques   my regret is all the greater for having

disturbed you at a moment when you were engaged doubtless  as every good

christian should be at such a time  in settling your accounts with god  



 my accounts are all settled  master student  i have sinned like a man 

but i have suffered like a martyr  and i hope that god  when weighing my

sins and my sorrows  will find that the sum of the latter exceeds that

of the former  



 amen   said aubry   i hope so too with all my heart  but if it will not

fatigue you too much  my dear companion in adversity   i say my dear

companion  because i presume you bear no malice on account of the little

accident which procured me the honor of your acquaintance a short time

since   if it will not fatigue you too much  i say  pray tell me how you

succeeded in ascertaining that i am a student  



 i knew it by your costume  and by the inkhorn hanging at your belt  in

the place where a gentleman carries his dagger  



 you say you knew it by my costume   by the inkhorn  ah  my dear

companion  you told me  if i mistake not  that you are at the point of

death  



 i hope that i have at last reached the end of my sufferings  yes  i

hope to fall asleep to day on earth  to wake to morrow in heaven  



 i in no wise dispute what you say   replied jacques   but i will

venture to remind you that your present situation is not one in which it

is customary to joke  



 who says that i am joking   murmured the dying man with a deep sigh 



 what  you say that you recognized me by my costume  by the inkhorn at

my belt  and i  look as hard as i may  cannot see my hands before my

face  



 possibly   rejoined the prisoner   but when you have been fifteen years

in a dungeon as i have  you will be able to see in the darkness  as well

as you could see formerly in broad daylight  



 may the devil tear my eyes out rather than make them serve such an

apprenticeship   cried the student   fifteen years  you have been

fifteen years in prison  



 fifteen or sixteen years  perhaps more  perhaps less  i long since

ceased to count days or to measure time  



 you must have committed some abominable crime   cried the student   to

have been punished so pitilessly  



 i am innocent   replied the prisoner 



 innocent   cried jacques aghast   ah  my dear comrade  i have already

reminded you that this is no time for joking  



 and i replied that i was not joking  



 but still less is it a time for lying  for a joke is simply a

relaxation of the mind  which offends neither heaven nor earth  while

lying is a deadly sin  which compromises the soul s wellbeing  



 i have never lied  



 why you say that you are innocent  and yet you have been fifteen years

in prison  



 fifteen years more or less  i said  



 ah   cried jacques   and i also am innocent  



 may god protect you then   rejoined the dying man 



 why do you say that  



 because a guilty man may hope for pardon  an innocent man  never  



 what you say is very profound  my friend  but it s not consoling at

all  do you know  



 i tell you the truth  



 come   said jacques   come  you have some little peccadillo or other to

reproach yourself with  haven t you  between ourselves  tell me about

it  



with that jacques  who was really beginning to distinguish objects in

the darkness  took a stool  carried it to the dying man s bedside  and 

selecting a spot where there was a recess in the wall  placed the stool

there and made himself as comfortable as possible in his improvised

arm chair 



 ah  you say nothing  my friend  you have no confidence in me  oh  well 

i can understand that  fifteen years in prison may well have made you

suspicious  my name is jacques aubry  i am twenty two years old  and a

student  as you have discovered   according to what you say  at least  i

had certain reasons which concern myself alone  for getting myself

committed to the châtelet  i have been here ten minutes  i have had the

honor of making your acquaintance  there s my whole life in a word  and

you know me now as well as i know myself  now  my dear companion  i will

listen to you  



 i am etienne raymond   said the prisoner 



 etienne raymond   the student repeated   i don t know that name  



 in the first place   said the prisoner   you were a child when it

pleased god to have me disappear from the world  in the next place  i

was of little consequence in the world  so that no one noticed my

absence  



 but what did you do  who were you  



 i was the connétable de bourbon s confidential servant  



 oho  and you had a share with him in betraying the state  in that case

i am no longer surprised  



 no  i refused to betray my master  that was all  



 tell me about it  how did it happen  



 i was at the constable s hôtel in paris  while he was living at his

château of bourbon l archambault  one day the captain of his guards

arrived with a letter from monseigneur  the letter bade me instantly

hand to the messenger a small sealed package which i would find in the

duke s bedroom in a small closet near the head of his bed  i went with

the captain to the bedroom  opened the closet  found the package in the

place described  and handed it to the messenger  who immediately took

his leave  an hour later an officer with a squad of soldiers came from

the louvre  and bade me throw open the duke s bedroom and show them a

small closet near the head of the bed  i obeyed  they opened the closet 

but failed to find what they sought  which was nothing less than the

package the duke s messenger had carried away  



 the devil  the devil   muttered aubry  beginning to take a deep

interest in the situation of his companion in misfortune 



 the officer made some terrible threats  to which i made no other reply

than that i knew nothing about what he asked me  for if i had said that

i had just handed the package to the duke s messenger  they could have

pursued him and taken it from him  



 peste   aubry interrupted   that was clever of you  and you acted like

a faithful and trusty retainer  



 thereupon the officer gave me in charge to two guards  and returned to

the louvre with the others  in half an hour he returned with orders to

take me to the château of pierre encise at lyons  they put irons on my

feet  bound my hands  and tossed me into a carriage with a soldier on

either side  five days later i was confined in a prison  which  i ought

to say  was far from being as dark and severe as this  but what does

that matter   muttered the dying man   a prison  s a prison  and i have

ended by becoming accustomed to this  as to all the others  



 hum   said jacques aubry   that proves you to be a philosopher  



 three days and three nights passed   continued etienne raymond   at

last  during the fourth night  i was awakened by a slight noise  i

opened my eyes  my door turned upon its hinges  a woman closely veiled

entered with the jailer  the jailer placed a lamp upon the table  and 

at a sign from my nocturnal visitor  left the cell  thereupon she drew

near my bed and raised her veil  i cried aloud  



  hein   who was it  pray   aubry asked  edging closer to the narrator 



 it was louise of savoy herself  the duchesse d angoulême in person  it

was the regent of france  the king s mother  



 oho   said aubry   and what was she doing with a poor devil like you  



 she was in quest of the same sealed package which i had delivered to

the duke s messenger  and which contained love letters written by the

imprudent princess to the man she was now persecuting  



 well  upon my word   muttered jacques between his teeth   here s a

story most devilishly like the story of the duchesse d etampes and

ascanio  



 alas  the stories of all frivolous  love sick princesses resemble one

another   replied the prisoner  whose ears seemed to be as quick as his

eyes were piercing   but woe to the poor devils who happen to be

involved in them  



 stay a moment  stay a moment  prophet of evil   cried aubry   what the

devil s that you re saying  i too am involved in the story of a

frivolous  love sick princess  



 very well  if that is so  say farewell to the light of day  say

farewell to life  



 go to the devil with your predictions of the other world  what s all

that to me  i m not the one she loves  but ascanio  



 was it i that the regent loved   retorted the prisoner   was it i 

whose very existence they had never heard of  no  but i was placed

between a barren love and a fruitful vengeance  and when they came

together i was the one to be crushed  



 by mahomet s belly  you are not very encouraging  my good man   cried

aubry   but let us return to the princess  for your narrative interests

me beyond measure  just because it makes me tremble  



 the packet contained letters which she wanted  as i have told you  in

exchange for them she promised me honors  dignities  titles  to see

those letters again she would have extorted four hundred thousand crowns

anew from another semblançay  though he should pay for his complaisance

on the scaffold 



 i replied that i hadn t the letters  that i knew nothing about them 

that i had no idea what she meant 



 thereupon her munificent offers were succeeded by threats  but she

found it no easier to intimidate than to bribe me  for i had told the

truth  i had delivered the letters to my noble master s messenger 



 she left my cell in a furious rage  and for a year i heard nothing

more  at the end of a year she returned  and the same scene was

repeated 



 at that time i begged  i implored her to let me go free  i adjured her

in the name of my wife and children  but to no purpose  i must give up

the letters or die in prison 



 one day i found a file in my bread 



 my noble master had remembered me  absent  exiled  a fugitive as he

was  of course he could not set me free by entreaty or by force  he sent

one of his servants to france  who induced the jailer to hand me the

file  telling me whence it came 



 i filed through one of the bars at my window  i made myself a rope with

my sheets  i descended by the rope  but when i came to the end of it i

felt in vain for the ground with my feet  i dropped  with god s name

upon my lips  and broke my leg in the fall  a night patrol found me

unconscious 



 i was thereupon transferred to the château of chalons sur saône  i

remained there about two years  at the end of which time my persecutress

made her appearance again  it was still the letters that brought her

thither  this time she was accompanied by the torturer  and i was put to

the question  this was useless barbarity  as she obtained no

information   indeed  she could obtain none  i knew nothing save that i

had delivered the letters to the duke s messenger 



 one day at the bottom of my jug of water i found a bag filled with

gold  once more my noble master bethought himself of his poor servant 



 i bribed a turnkey  or rather the miserable creature pretended to be

bribed  at midnight he opened the door of my cell  and i went out  i

followed him through several corridors  i could already feel the air

that living men breathe  and thought that i was free  when guards rushed

out upon us and bound us both  my guide had pretended to yield to my

entreaties in order to get possession of the gold he had seen in my

hands  and then betrayed me to earn the reward offered to informers 



 they brought me to the châtelet  to this cell 



 here  for the last time  louise of savoy appeared  she was accompanied

by the executioner 



 the prospect of death could have no other effect than the promises 

threats  and torture  my hands were bound  a rope was passed through a

ring and placed around my neck  i made the same reply as always to her

demands  adding that she would fulfil my dearest wish by putting me to

death  for i was driven to despair by my life of captivity 



 it was that feeling  doubtless  which made her hold her hand  she went

out and the executioner followed her 



 since then i have never seen her  what has become of my noble master 

what has become of the cruel duchess  i have no idea  for since that

time  some fifteen years perhaps  i have not exchanged a single word

with a single living being  



 they are both dead   said aubry 



 both dead  the noble hearted duke is dead  why  he would still be a

young man  not more than fifty two  how did he die  



 he was killed at the siege of rome  and probably    jacques was about

to add   by one of my friends   but he refrained  thinking that

might cause a coolness between the old man and himself  jacques  as we

know  was becoming very discreet 



 probably   the prisoner repeated 



 by a goldsmith named benvenuto cellini  



 twenty years ago i would have cursed the murderer  to day i say from

the bottom of my heart   may his murderer be blessed   did they give my

noble lord a burial worthy of the man  



 i think so  they built a tomb for him in the cathedral of gaeta  and

upon the tomb is an epitaph wherein it is said that  beside him who

sleeps there  alexander the great was a sorry knave  and cæsar an idle

blackguard  



 and the other  



 what other  



 the woman who persecuted me  



 dead also  dead nine years since  



 just so  one night  here in my cell  i saw a phantom kneeling and

praying  i cried out and it disappeared  it was she asking my

forgiveness  



 do you think  then  that when death came upon her she relented  



 i trust so  for her soul s sake  



 but in that case they should have set you free  



 she may have requested it  but i am of so little importance that i was

probably forgotten in the excitement of that great catastrophe  



 and so you would likewise forgive her  as you are about to die  



 lift me up  young man  that i may pray for both of them   and the dying

man  resting in jacques aubry s arms  coupled the names of his protector

and persecutress in the same prayer  the man who had remembered him in

his affection and the woman who had never forgotten him in her

hatred   the constable and the regent 



the prisoner was right  jacques aubry s eyes began to become accustomed

to the darkness  and he could make out the dying man s features  he was

a handsome old man  much emaciated by suffering  with a white beard and

a bald head   such a head as domenichino dreamed of when painting his

confession of saint jerome 



when his prayer was finished  he heaved a deep sigh  and fell back upon

the bed  he had swooned 



jacques thought that he was dead  he ran to the water jug  however 

poured some water in the hollow of his hand  and shook it over his face 

the dying man returned to life once more 



 you did well to revive me  young man   said he   and here is your

reward  



 what is that  



 a dagger  



 a dagger  how did it come into your hands  



 wait one moment  one day  when the turnkey brought my bread and water 

he put the lamp upon the stool which happened to be standing near the

wall  in the wall at that point was a protruding stone  and i saw some

letters cut with a knife upon it  i hadn t time to read them  but i dug

up some earth with my hands  moistened it so as to make a sort of paste 

and took an impression of the letters  which formed the word  ultor  



 what was the significance of that word  which means avenger  i returned

to the stone  i tried to shake it  it moved like a tooth in its socket 

by dint of patience and persistent efforts i succeeded in removing it

from the wall  i immediately plunged my hand into the hole  and found

this dagger 



 thereupon the longing for liberty  which i had almost lost  returned to

me in full force  i resolved to dig a passage way from this to some

dungeon near at hand with the dagger  and there concoct some plan of

escape with its occupant  besides  even if it all ended in failure  the

digging and cutting was something to occupy my time  and when you have

spent twenty years in a dungeon as i have  young man  you will realize

what a formidable enemy time is  



aubry shuddered from head to foot   did you ever put your plan in

execution   he inquired 



 yes  and more easily than i anticipated  after the twelve or fifteen

years that i have been here  they have doubtless ceased to think of my

escape as a possibility  indeed  it s very likely that they no longer

know who i am  they keep me  as they keep the chain hanging from yonder

ring  the constable and the regent are dead  and they alone remembered

me  who would now recognize the name of etienne raymond  even in this

place  if i should pronounce it  no one  



aubry felt the perspiration starting from every pore as he thought of

the oblivion into which this lost existence had fallen 



 well   he exclaimed questioningly    well  



 for more than a year   said the old man   i dug and dug  and i

succeeded in making a hole under the wall large enough for a man to pass

through  



 but what did you do with the dirt you took from the hole  



 i strewed it over the floor of my cell  and trod it in by constantly

walking upon it  



 where is the hole  



 under my bed  for fifteen years no one has ever thought of moving it 

the jailer came down into my cell only once a day  when he had gone  and

the doors were closed  and the sound of his footsteps had died away  i

would draw out my bed and set to work  when the time for his visit drew

near  i would move the bed back to its place  and lie down upon it 



 day before yesterday i lay down upon it never to rise again  i was at

the end of my strength  to day i am at the end of my life  you are most

welcome  young man  you shall assist me to die  and i will make you my

heir  



 your heir   said aubry in amazement 



 to be sure  i will leave you this dagger  you smile  what more precious

heritage could a prisoner leave you  this dagger is freedom  perhaps  



 you are right   said aubry   and i thank you  whither does this hole

that you have dug lead  



 i had not reached the other end  but i was very near it  day before

yesterday i heard voices in the cell beside this  



 the devil   said aubry   and you think   



 i think that you will have finished my work in a very few hours  



 thanks   said aubry   thanks  



 and now  a priest  i would much like to see a priest   said the

moribund 



 wait  father  wait   said aubry   it is impossible that they would

refuse such a request from a dying man  



he ran to the door  this time without stumbling  his eyes being somewhat

accustomed to the darkness  and knocked with feet and hands both 



a turnkey came down 



 what s the matter  that you make such an uproar   he demanded   what do

you want  



 the old man here with me is dying   said aubry   and asks for a priest 

can you refuse  



 hum   grumbled the jailer   i don t know why these fellows must all

want priests  it s all right  we ll send him one  



ten minutes later the priest appeared  carrying the viaticum and

preceded by two sacristans  one with the crucifix  the other with the

bell 



a solemn and impressive spectacle was the confession of this martyr  who

had naught to disclose but the crimes of others  and who prayed for his

enemies instead of asking pardon for himself 



unimaginative as was jacques aubry  he fell upon his knees  and

remembered the prayers of his childhood  which he thought he had

forgotten 



when the prisoner had finished his confession  the priest bowed before

him and asked his blessing 



the old man s face lighted up with a smile as radiant as the smile of

god s elect  he extended one hand over the priest s head and the other

toward aubry  drew a deep breath  and fell back upon his pillow  that

breath was his last 



the priest went out as he had come  attended by his subordinates  and

the dungeon  lighted for a moment by the flickering flame of the

candles  became dark once more 



jacques aubry was alone with the dead  it was a very depressing

situation  especially in the light of the reflections to which it gave

rise  the man who lay lifeless before him had been consigned to prison

an innocent man  had remained there twenty years  and went out at last

only because death  the great liberator  came in search of him 



the light hearted student could not recognize himself  for the first

time he found himself confronted by stern reality  for the first time he

looked in the face the bewildering vicissitudes of life  and the calm

profundity of death 



then a selfish thought began to take shape in his heart  he thought of

himself  innocent like the dead man  and like him involved in the

complications of one of those royal passions which crush and consume and

destroy a life  ascanio and he might disappear  as etienne raymond had

disappeared  who would think of them 



gervaise perhaps  benvenuto cellini certainly 



but the former could do nothing but weep  and the other confessed his

own powerlessness when he cried so loudly for the letter in ascanio s

possession 



his only chance of safety  his only hope  lay in the heritage of the

dead man  an old dagger  which had already disappointed the expectations

of its two former owners 



jacques aubry had hidden the dagger in his breast  and he nervously put

his hand upon the hilt to make sure that it was still there 



at that moment the door opened  and men came in to remove the body 



 when shall you bring me my dinner   jacques asked   i am hungry  



 in two hours   the jailer replied 



with that the student was left alone in the cell 









xv





an honest theft





aubrey passed the two hours sitting upon his stool  without once moving 

his mind was so active that it kept his body at rest 



at the appointed hour the turnkey came down  renewed the water  and

changed the bread  this was what  in châtelet parlance  was called a

dinner 



the student remembered what the dying man told him  that the door of his

cell would be opened but once in the twenty four hours  however he still

remained for a long while in the same place  absolutely motionless 

fearing lest the event that had just occurred should cause some change

in the routine of the prison 



he soon observed  through his air hole  that it was beginning to grow

dark  the day just passed had been a well filled day for him  in the

morning  the examination by the magistrate  at noon  the duel with

marmagne  at one o clock  lodged in prison  at three  the prisoner s

death  and now his first attempts at securing his freedom 



a man does not pass many such days in his life 



jacques aubry rose at last  and walked to the door to listen for

footsteps  then  in order that the dirt and the wall might leave no

marks upon his doublet  he removed that portion of his costume  pulled

the bed away from the corner  and found the opening of which his

companion had spoken 



he crawled like a snake into the narrow gallery  which was some eight

feet deep  and which  after making a dip under the partition wall 

ascended on the other side 



as soon as he plunged his dagger into the earth he knew by the sound

that he would very soon accomplish his purpose  which was to open a

passage into some place or other  what that place would be only a

sorcerer could have told 



he kept actively at work  making as little noise as possible  from time

to time he went out of the excavation as a miner does  in order to

scatter the loose earth about the floor of his cell  otherwise it would

eventually have blocked up the gallery  then he would crawl back  and

set to work once more 



while aubrey was working  ascanio was thinking sadly of colombe 



he too  as we have said  had been taken to the châtelet  he too had

been cast into a dungeon  but  it may have been by chance  it may have

been at the duchess s suggestion  his quarters were a little less bare 

consequently a little more habitable  than the student s 



but what did ascanio care for a little more or a little less comfort 

his dungeon was a dungeon all the same  his captivity a separation  he

had not colombe  who was more to him than light  or liberty  or life 

were colombe with him in his dungeon  the dungeon would become an abode

of bliss  a palace of enchantment 



the poor child had been so happy during the days immediately preceding

his arrest  thinking of his beloved by day  and sitting by her side at

night  he had never thought that his happiness might some day come to an

end  and if  sometimes  in the midst of his felicity  the iron hand of

doubt had clutched his heart  he had  like one threatened by danger from

some unknown source  promptly put aside all uneasiness concerning the

future that he might lose none of his present bliss 



and now he was in prison  alone  far from colombe  who was perhaps

imprisoned like himself  perhaps a prisoner in some convent  whence she

could escape in no other way than by going to the chapel  where the

husband whom they sought to force upon her awaited her 



two redoubtable passions were standing guard at their cell doors  the

love of madame d etampes at ascanio s  the ambition of comte d orbec at

colombe s 



as soon as he was alone in his dungeon  therefore  ascanio became very

sad and down hearted  his was one of those clinging natures which need

the support of some robust organization  he was one of those slender 

graceful flowers  which bend before the first breath of the tempest  and

straighten up again only in the vivifying rays of the sun 



had benvenuto been in his place  his first thought would have been to

examine the doors  sound the walls  and stamp upon the floor  to see if

one or the other would not afford his quick and combative mind some

possible means of escape  but ascanio sat down upon his bed  let his

head fall upon his breast  and whispered colombe s name  it never

occurred to him that one could escape by any possible means from a

dungeon behind three iron doors and surrounded by walls six feet thick 



the dungeon was  as we have said  a little less bare and a little more

habitable than that assigned to jacques  it contained a bed  a table 

two chairs  and an old rush mat  furthermore  a lamp was burning upon a

stone projection  doubtless arranged for that purpose  beyond question

it was a cell set apart for privileged prisoners 



there was also a great difference in the matter of food  instead of the

bread and water which was brought to the student once a day  ascanio

enjoyed two daily repasts  a privilege somewhat neutralized by the

consequent necessity of seeing the jailer twice in the twenty four

hours  these repasts  it should be said to the credit of the

philanthropic administration of the châtelet  were not altogether

execrable 



ascanio thought but little of such paltry details  his was one of those

delicate feminine organizations which seem to exist on perfume and dew 

without awaking from his reverie he ate a hit of bread  drank a few

drops of wine  and continued to think of colombe and of benvenuto

cellini  of colombe as of her to whom all his love was given  of cellini

as of him in whom lay all his hope 



indeed  up to that moment ascanio had never been concerned with any of

the cares or details of existence  benvenuto lived for both  and ascanio

was content to breathe  to dream of some lovely work of art  and to love

colombe  he was like the fruit which grows upon a sturdy tree  and draws

all its life from the tree 



and even now  perilous as was his situation  if he could have seen

benvenuto cellini at the moment of his arrest  or at the moment of his

incarceration  and benvenuto had said to him  with a warm grasp of his

hand 



 have no fear  ascanio  for i am watching over you and colombe   his

confidence in the master was so great that  relying upon that promise

alone  he would have waited without anxiety for the prison doors to be

thrown open  sure that thrown open they would be  in spite of bars and

locks 



but he had not seen benvenuto  and benvenuto did not know that his

cherished pupil  the son of his stefana  was a prisoner  it would have

taken a whole day to carry the intelligence to him at fontainebleau 

assuming that it had occurred to any one to do it  another day to return

to paris  and in two days the enemies of the lovers might gain a long

lead upon their defender 



so it was that ascanio passed the rest of the day and the whole of the

night following his arrest without sleep  sometimes pacing back and

forth in his cell  sometimes sitting down  and occasionally throwing

himself upon the bed  which was provided with white sheets   a special

mark of favor which proved that ascanio had been particularly commended

to the attention of the authorities  during that day and night and the

following morning nothing worthy of note occurred  unless it was the

regular visit of the jailer to bring his food 



about two o clock in the afternoon  as nearly as the prisoner could

judge by his reckoning of the time  he thought that he heard voices near

at hand  it was a dull  indistinct murmur  but evidently caused by the

vocal organs of human beings  ascanio listened and walked toward the

point whence the sound seemed to come  it was at one of the corners of

his cell  he silently put his ear to the wall and to the ground  and

found that the voices apparently came from beneath the floor 



it was evident that he had neighbors who were separated from him only by

a thin partition or an equally thin floor  after some two hours the

sounds ceased  and all was still once more 



toward night the noise began again  but this time it was of a different

nature  it was not that which would be made by two persons speaking

together  but consisted of dull  hurried blows as of some one cutting

stone  it came from the same place  did not cease for a second  and

seemed to come nearer and nearer 



absorbed as ascanio was in his own thoughts  this noise seemed to him

deserving of some attention none the less  so he sat with his eyes glued

to the spot whence it came  he judged that it must be near midnight  but

he did not once think of sleeping  notwithstanding that he had not slept

for so many hours 



the noise continued  as it was long past the usual hour for work  it was

evidently some prisoner seeking to escape  ascanio smiled sadly at the

thought that the poor devil  who would think for a moment  mayhap  that

he was at liberty  would find that he had simply changed his cell 



at last the noise approached so near that ascanio ran and seized his

lamp  and returned with it to the corner  almost at the same moment the

earth rose up in that spot  and as it fell away disclosed a human head 



ascanio uttered an exclamation of wonder  followed by a cry of joy  to

which a no less delighted cry made answer  the head belonged to jacques

aubry 



in an instant  thanks to the assistance rendered by ascanio to the

unexpected visitor who made his appearance in such extraordinary

fashion  the two friends were in one another s arms 



as will readily be conceived  the first questions and answers were

somewhat incoherent  but at last  after exchanging a few disconnected

exclamations  they succeeded in restoring some semblance of order to

their thoughts  and in casting some light upon recent events  ascanio to

be sure had almost nothing to say  and everything to learn 



eventually aubry told him the whole story  how he had returned to the

hôtel de nesle simultaneously with benvenuto  how they had learned

almost at the same moment of the arrest of ascanio and the abduction of

colombe  how benvenuto had rushed off to his studio like a madman 

shouting   to the casting  to the casting   and he  aubry  to the

châtelet  of what had taken place at the hôtel de nesle since that

time the student could tell him nothing 



but to the general narrative of the iliad succeeded the private

adventures of ulysses  aubry described to ascanio his disappointment at

his failure to get committed to prison  his visit to gervaise  and her

denunciation of him to the lieutenant criminal  his terrible

examination  which had no other result than the paltry fine of twenty

paris sous  a result most insulting to the honor of gervaise  and

finally his encounter with marmagne just as he was beginning to despair

of procuring his own incarceration  from that point he related

everything that had happened to him up to the moment when  utterly in

the dark as to what cell he was about to enter  he had thrust his head

through the last crust of earth  and discerned by the light of his lamp

his friend ascanio 



whereupon the friends once more embraced with great heartiness 



 now   said jacques aubry   listen to me  ascanio  for there is no time

to lose  



 but first of all   said ascanio   tell me of colombe  where is

colombe  



 colombe  i can t tell you  with madame d etampes  i think  



 with madame d etampes   cried ascanio    her rival  



 so what they say of the duchess s love for you is true  is it  



ascanio blushed and stammered some unintelligible words 



 oh  you needn t blush for that   cried aubry   deuce take me  a

duchess  and a duchess who s the king s mistress at that  i should never

have any such luck  but let us come back to business  



 yes   said ascanio   let us come back to colombe  



 bah  i m not talking about colombe  i m talking about a letter  



 what letter  



 a letter the duchesse d etampes wrote you  



 who told you that i have a letter from the duchesse d etampes in my

possession  



 benvenuto cellini  



 why did he tell you that  



 because he must have that letter  because it is absolutely essential

that he should have it  because i agreed to take it to him  because all

i have done was done to get possession of that letter  



 but for what purpose does benvenuto want the letter  



 ah  faith  i ve no idea  and it doesn t concern me  he said to me   i

must have that letter   i said to him   very good  i will get it for

you   i have had myself put in prison in order to get it  so give it me 

and i agree to deliver it to benvenuto  well  what s the matter  



this last question was induced by the cloud which spread over ascanio s

face 



 the matter is  my poor aubry   said he   that your trouble is thrown

away  



 how so   cried aubry   haven t you the letter still  



 it is here   said ascanio  placing his hand upon the pocket of his

doublet 



 ah  that s well  give it to me  and i will take it to benvenuto  



 that letter will never leave me  jacques  



 why so  



 because i don t know what use benvenuto proposes to make of it  



 he means to use it to save you  



 and to crush the duchesse d etampes  it may be  aubry  i will not help

to ruin a woman  



 but this woman seeks to ruin you  this woman detests you  no  i am

wrong  she adores you  



 and you would have me  in return for that feeling   



 why  it s exactly the same as if she hated you since you don t love

her  besides  it s she who has done all this  



 what  she who has done it  



 why  yes  it was she who caused your arrest  and carried off colombe  



 who told you that  



 no one  but who else could it have been  



 why the provost  or d orbec  or marmagne  to whom you admit that you

told the whole story  



 ascanio  ascanio   cried jacques in despair   you are destroying

yourself  



 i prefer to destroy myself  rather than do a dastardly deed  aubry  



 but this is no dastardly deed  for benvenuto is the one who undertakes

to do it  



 listen to me  aubry   said ascanio   and don t be angry at what i say 

if benvenuto stood in your place  and should say to me   it was madame

d etampes  your enemy  who caused your arrest  who carried off colombe 

who now has her in her power and intends to force her to do what she

does not wish to do   i cannot save colombe unless i have that

letter    i would make him swear that he would not show it to the king 

and then i would give it to him  but benvenuto is not here  and i am not

certain that it is the duchess who is persecuting me  this letter would

not be safe in your hands  aubry  forgive me  but you yourself admit

that you are an arrant chatterbox  



 i promise you  ascanio  that the day i have just passed has aged me ten

years  



 you may lose the letter  or  with the best intentions  i know  make an

injudicious use of it  aubry  so the letter will remain where it is  



 but  my dear fellow   cried jacques   remember that benvenuto himself

said that nothing but this letter can save you  



 benvenuto will save me without that  aubry  benvenuto has the king s

word that he will grant him whatever favor he asks on the day that his

jupiter is safely cast  when you thought that benvenuto was going mad

because he shouted   to the casting   he was beginning to rescue me  



 but suppose the casting should be unsuccessful   said aubry 



 there s no danger   rejoined ascanio with a smile 



 but that sometimes happens to the most skilful founders in france  so i

am told  



 the most skilful founders in france are mere schoolboys compared to

benvenuto  



 but how much time is required for the casting  



 three days  



 and how much more before the statue can be put before the king  



 three days more  



 six or seven days in all  and suppose madame d etampes forces colombe

to marry d orbec within six days  



 madame d etampes has no power over colombe  colombe will resist  



 very true  but the provost has power over colombe as his daughter  and

king françois i  has power over colombe as his subject  suppose the

provost and the king both order her to marry him  



ascanio became frightfully pale 



 suppose that when benvenuto demands your liberty  colombe is already

the wife of another  what will you do with your liberty then  



ascanio passed one hand across his brow to wipe away the cold sweat

which the student s words caused to start thereon  while with the other

hand he felt in his pocket for the precious letter  but just as aubry

felt certain that he was on the point of yielding  he shook his head as

if to banish all irresolution 



 no   he said   no  no no one save benvenuto  let us talk of something

else  



these words he uttered in a tone which indicated that  for the moment at

least  it was useless to insist 



 in that case   said aubry  apparently forming a momentous resolution 

 in that case  my friend  if we are to talk on other subjects we may as

well do it to morrow morning  or later in the day  for i am afraid we

may remain here for some time  for my own part  i confess that i am worn

out by my tribulations of the day and my labor to night  and shall not

be sorry for a little rest  do you remain here  and i will go back to my

own cell  when you want to see me again  do you call me  meanwhile 

spread this mat over the hole i have made  so that our communications

may not be cut off  good night  the night brings counsel  they say  and

i hope that i shall find you more reasonable to morrow morning  



with that  and refusing to listen to the observations of ascanio  who

sought to detain him  jacques aubry plunged head first into his gallery 

and crawled back to his cell  ascanio  meanwhile  following up the

advice his friend had given him  dragged the mat into the corner of his

cell as soon as the student s legs had disappeared  the means of

communication between the two cells thereupon disappeared altogether 



he then tossed his doublet upon one of the two chairs which  with the

table and the lamp  constituted the furnishings of his apartment 

stretched himself out upon the bed  and  overdone with fatigue as he

was  soon fell asleep  his bodily weariness carrying the day over his

mental torture 



aubry  instead of following ascanio s example  although he was quite as

much in need of sleep as he  sat down upon his stool  and began to

reflect deeply  which  as the reader knows  was so entirely contrary to

all his habits  that it was evident that he was meditating some grand

stroke 



the student s immobility lasted about fifteen minutes  after which he

rose slowly  and  with the step of a man whose irresolution is at an end

for good and all  walked to the hole  and crawled into it again  but

this time with so much caution and so noiselessly  that  when he reached

the other end and raised the mat  he was overjoyed to perceive that the

operation had not aroused his friend 



that was all that the student wished  with even greater caution than he

had theretofore exhibited  he crept stealthily forth from his

underground gallery  and approached with bated breath the chair on which

ascanio s doublet lay  with one eye fixed upon the sleeping youth  and

his ears on the alert for the slightest sound  he took from the pocket

the precious letter so eagerly coveted by cellini  and placed in the

envelope a note from gervaise  which he folded in exactly the same shape

as the duchess s letter  sure that ascanio would believe  so long as he

did not open it  that lovely anne d heilly s missive was still in his

possession 



as silently as ever he stole back to the mat  raised it  crawled into

the hole once more  and disappeared like the phantoms who sink through

trap doors at the opera 



it was high time  for he was no sooner back in his cell  than he heard

ascanio s door grinding on its hinges  and his friend s voice crying  in

the tone of one suddenly aroused from sleep   



 who s there  



 i   responded a soft voice   do not be afraid  for it is a friend  



ascanio  who was but half dressed  rose at the sound of the voice  which

he seemed to recognize  and saw by the light of his lamp a veiled woman

standing by the door  she slowly approached him and raised her veil  he

was not mistaken   it was madame d etampes 









xvi





wherein it is proved that a grisette s letter 

when it is burned  makes as much flame

and ashes as a duchess s





there was upon anne d heilly s mobile features an expression of sadness

mingled with compassion  which deceived ascanio completely  and

confirmed him  even before she had opened her mouth  in the impression

that she was entirely innocent of any share in the catastrophe of which

he and colombe were victims 



 you here  ascanio   she said in a melodious voice   you  to whom i

would have given a palace to live in  i find in a prison  



 ah  madame   cried the youth   it is true  is it not  that you know

nothing of the persecution to which we are subjected  



 did you suspect me for an instant  ascanio   said the duchess   in that

case you have every reason to hate me  and i can only bewail in silence

my ill fortune in being so little known to him i know so well  



 no  madame  no   said ascanio   i was told that you were responsible

for it all  but i refused to believe it  



  t was well done of you  ascanio  you do not love me  but with you

hatred at least is not synonymous with injustice  you were right 

ascanio  not only am i not responsible for it  but i knew nothing

whatever about it  it was the provost  messire d estourville  he learned

the whole story  i know not how  told it all to the king  and obtained

from him the order to arrest you and recover colombe  



 and colombe is with her father   demanded ascanio eagerly 



 no  colombe is with me  



 with you  madame   cried the young man   why with you  



 she is very lovely  ascanio   murmured the duchess   and i can

understand why you prefer her to all the women in the world  even though

the most loving of them all offers you the richest of duchies  



 i love colombe  madame   said ascanio   and you know that love  which

is a treasure sent from heaven  is to be preferred to all earthly

treasures  



 yes  ascanio  yes  you love her above everything  for a moment i hoped

that your passion for her was only a passing fancy  i was mistaken  yes 

i realize now   she added with a sigh   that to keep you apart any

longer would be to run counter to god s will  



 ah  madame   cried ascanio  clasping his hands   god has placed in your

hands the power to bring us together  be noble and generous to the end 

madame  and make two children happy who will love you and bless you all

their lives  



 yes   said the duchess   i am vanquished  ascanio  yes  i am ready to

protect and defend you  but alas  it may be too late even now  



 too late  what do you mean   cried ascanio 



 it may be  ascanio  it may be that at this moment i am lost myself  



 lost  madame  how so  in god s name  



 for having loved you  



 for having loved me  you  lost because of me  



 yes  imprudent creature that i am  lost because of you  lost because i

wrote to you  



 how so  i do not understand you  madame  



 you do not understand that the provost  armed with an order from the

king  has directed a general search to be made at the hôtel de nesle 

you do not understand that this search  the principal purpose of which

is to find proofs of your affair with colombe  will be most rigorously

carried out in your bedroom  



 what then   demanded ascanio  impatiently 



 why   continued the duchess   if they find that letter  which in a

moment of frenzy i wrote to you  if it is recognized as mine  if it is

laid before the king  whom i was then deceiving  and whom i was willing

to betray for you  do you not understand that my power is at an end from

that moment  do you not understand that i can then do nothing either for

you or for colombe  do you not understand  in short  that i am lost  



 oh   cried ascanio   have no fear  madame  there is no danger of that 

the letter is here  it has never left me  



the duchess breathed freely once more  and the expression of her face

changed from anxiety to joy 



 it has never left you  ascanio   she repeated   it has never left you 

to what sentiment  pray tell me  do i owe the fact that fortunate

letter has never left you  



 to prudence  madame   murmured ascanio 



 prudence  mon dieu  mon dieu  i am wrong once more  and yet i surely

should be convinced ere this  prudence  ah well   she added  seeming to

make a powerful effort to restrain her feelings   in that case  as i

have naught but your prudence to thank  ascanio  do you think it very

prudent to keep it upon your person  when they may come to your cell at

any moment and search you by force  do you think it prudent  i say  to

keep a letter which  if it is found  will put the only person who can

save you and colombe in a position where it will be impossible for her

to help you  



 madame   said ascanio  in his melodious voice  and with that tinge of

melancholy which all pure hearts feel when they are forced to doubt   i

know not if the purpose to save colombe and myself exists at the bottom

of your heart as it does upon your lips  i know not whether the desire

to see that letter again  and nothing more  is the motive of your visit

to me  i know not whether  as soon as you have it in your possession 

you may not lay aside this  rôle  of protectress which you have

assumed  and become our enemy once more  but this i do know  madame 

that the letter is yours  that it belongs to you  and that the moment

you claim it i cease to have the right to keep it from you  



ascanio rose  went straight to the chair upon which his doublet lay  put

his hand in the pocket  and took out a letter  the envelope of which the

duchess recognized at a glance 



 here  madame   he said   is the paper you are so anxious to possess 

and which can be of no use to me  while it may injure you seriously 

take it  tear it up  destroy it  i have done my duty  you may do what

you choose  



 ah  yours is indeed a noble heart  ascanio   cried the duchess  acting

in obedience to one of those generous impulses which are sometimes found

in the most corrupt hearts 



 some one comes  madame  take care   cried ascanio 



 true   said the duchess 



at the sound of approaching footsteps she hastily thrust the paper into

the flame of the lamp  which consumed it in an instant  the duchess did

not let it drop until the flame had almost scorched her fingers  when

the letter  three fourths consumed  drifted slowly downward  when it

reached the floor it was entirely reduced to ashes  but the duchess was

not content until she had placed her foot upon them 



at that moment the provost appeared in the doorway 



 i was told that you were here  madame   he said  looking uneasily from

the duchess to ascanio   and i hastened to descend and place myself at

your service  is there aught in which i  or they who are under my

orders  can be of any use to you  



 no  messire   she replied  unable to conceal the feeling of intense joy

which overflowed from her heart upon her face   no  but i am none the

less obliged to you for your readiness and your good will  i came simply

to question this young man whom you arrested  and to ascertain if he is

really as guilty as he was said to be  



 and what is your conclusion   queried the provost  in a tone to which

he could not refrain from imparting a slight tinge of irony 



 that ascanio is less guilty than i thought  i beg you  therefore 

messire  to show him every consideration in your power  the poor child

is in wretched quarters  could you not give him a better room  



 we will look to it to morrow  madame  for you know that your wishes are

commands to me  have you any other commands  and do you wish to continue

your examination  



 no  messire   was the reply   i know all that i wished to know  



with that the duchess left the dungeon  darting at ascanio a parting

glance of mingled gratitude and passion 



the provost followed her and the door closed behind them 



 pardieu   muttered jacques aubry  who had not lost a word of the

conversation between the duchess and ascanio   pardieu  it was time  



it had been marmagne s first thought on recovering consciousness to send

word to the duchess that he had received a wound which might well prove

to be mortal  and that before he breathed his last he desired to impart

to her a secret of the deepest moment  upon receipt of that message the

duchess hastened to his side  marmagne then informed her that he had

been attacked and wounded by a certain student named jacques aubry  who

was endeavoring to gain admission to the châtelet in order to get

speech of ascanio and carry to cellini a letter that was in ascanio s

possession 



the duchess needed to hear no more  and  bitterly cursing the passion

which had led her once more to overstep the limits of her ordinary

prudence  she hurried to the châtelet although it was two o clock in

the morning  demanded to be shown to ascanio s cell  and there enacted

the scene we have described  which had ended in accordance with her

wishes so far as she knew  although ascanio was not altogether deceived 



as jacques aubry said  it was high time 



but only half of his task was accomplished  and the most difficult part

remained to do  he had the letter which had come so near being destroyed

forever  but in order that it should have its full effect it must be in

cellini s hands  not in jacques aubry s 



now jacques aubry was a prisoner  very much a prisoner  and he had

learned from his predecessor that it was no easy matter to get out of

the châtelet  once one was safely lodged therein  he was therefore  we

might say  in much the same plight as the rooster who found the pearl 

greatly perplexed as to the use to be made of his treasure 



to attempt to escape by resorting to violence would be utterly vain  he

might with his dagger kill the keeper who brought his food  and take his

keys and his clothes  but not only was that extreme method repugnant to

the student s kindly disposition   it did not afford sufficiently strong

hopes of success  there were ten chances to one that he would be

recognized  searched  relieved of his precious letter  and thrust back

into his cell 



to attempt to escape by cunning was even less hopeful  the dungeon was

eight or ten feet underground  there were huge iron bars across the

air hole through which the one faint ray of light filtered into his

cell  it would take months to loosen one of those bars  and  suppose one

of them to be removed  where would the fugitive then find himself   in

some courtyard with insurmountable walls  where he would inevitably be

found the next morning 



bribery was his only remaining resource  but  as a consequence of the

sentence pronounced by the lieutenant criminal  whereby gervaise was

awarded twenty paris sous for the loss of her honor  the prisoner s

whole fortune was reduced to ten paris sous  a sum utterly inadequate to

tempt the lowest jailer of the vilest prison  and which could not

decently be offered to the turnkey of a royal fortress 



jacques aubry was therefore  we are forced to confess  in the direst

perplexity 



from time to time it seemed as if a hopeful idea passed through his

mind  but it was evident that it was likely to entail serious

consequences  for each time that it returned  with the persistence

characteristic of hopeful ideas  aubry s face grew perceptibly darker 

and he heaved deep sighs  which proved that the poor fellow was

undergoing an internal conflict of the most violent description 



this conflict was so violent and so prolonged that aubry did not once

think of sleep the whole night long  he passed the time in striding to

and fro  in sitting down and standing up  it was the first time that he

had ever kept vigil all night for purposes of reflection  his previous

experiences in that line had been on convivial occasions only 



at daybreak the struggle seemed to have ended in the complete triumph of

one of the opposing forces  for jacques heaved a more heart breaking

sigh than any he had yet achieved  and threw himself upon his bed like

a man completely crushed 



his head had hardly touched the pillow when he heard steps on the

staircase  the key grated in the lock  the door turned upon its hinges 

and two officers of the law appeared in the doorway  they were the

lieutenant criminal and his clerk 



the annoyance of the visit was tempered by the student s gratification

in recognizing two old acquaintances 



 aha  my fine fellow   said the magistrate  recognizing aubry   so it s

you  is it  and you succeeded after all in getting into the châtelet 

 tudieu   what a rake you are  you seduce young women and run young

noblemen through the body  but beware  a nobleman s life is more

expensive than a grisette s honor  and you ll not be quit of this affair

for twenty paris sous  



alarming as the worthy magistrate s words undoubtedly were  the tone in

which he uttered them reassured the prisoner to some extent  this

jovial faced individual  into whose hands he had had the good luck to

fall  was such a good fellow to all appearance that it was impossible to

think of him in connection with anything deadly  to be sure it was not

the same with his clerk  who nodded his head approvingly at each word

that fell from his principal s lips  it was the second time that jacques

aubry had seen the two men side by side  and  deeply engrossed as he was

by his own precarious situation  he could not forbear some internal

reflections upon the whimsical chance which had coupled together two

beings so utterly opposed to each other in character and feature 



the examination began  jacques aubry made no attempt at concealment  he

declared that  having recognized the vicomte de marmagne as a man who

had on several occasions betrayed his confidence  he seized his page s

sword and challenged him  that marmagne had accepted the challenge  and

that after exchanging a few thrusts the viscount fell  more than that he

did not know 



 you know no more than that  you know no more than that   muttered the

judge   faith  i should say that was quite enough  and your

affair s as clear as day  especially as the vicomte de marmagne is one

of madame d etampes s great favorites  so it seems that she has

complained of you to the higher powers  my boy  



 the devil   exclaimed the scholar  beginning to feel decidedly ill at

ease   tell me  monsieur le juge  is the affair so bad as you say  



 worse  my dear friend  worse  i am not in the habit of frightening

those who come before me  but i give you warning of this  so that if you

have any arrangements to make   



 arrangements to make   cried the student   tell me  monsieur le

lieutenant criminel  for god s sake  do you think my life s in danger  



 certainly it is  certainly  what  you attack a nobleman in the street 

you force him to fight  you run a sword through him  and then you ask if

your life s in danger  yes  my dear friend  yes   in very great danger  



 but such affairs happen every day  and i don t see that the guilty ones

are prosecuted  



 true  among gentlemen  my young friend  oh  when it pleases two

gentlemen to cut each other s throats  it s a privilege of their rank 

and the king has nothing to say  but if the common people take it into

their head some fine day to fight with gentlemen  as they are twenty

times as numerous  there would soon be no more gentlemen  which would be

a great pity  



 how many days do you think my trial will last  



 five or six  in all likelihood  



 what   cried the student   five or six days  no more than that  



 why should it  the facts are clear enough  a man dies  you confess that

you killed him  and justice is satisfied  however   added the judge 

assuming a still more benevolent expression   if two or three days more

would be agreeable to you   



 very agreeable  



 oh well  we will spin out the report  and gain time in that way  you

are a good fellow at heart  and i shall be delighted to do something for

you  



 thanks   said the student 



 and now   said the judge  rising   have you any further request to

make  



 i would like to see a priest  is it impossible  



 no  it is your right  



 in that case  monsieur le juge  ask them to send one to me  



 i will do your errand  no ill will  my young friend  



 good lack  on the contrary  i am deeply grateful  



 master student   said the clerk in an undertone  stepping to aubrey s

side   would you be willing to do me a favor  



 gladly   said aubrey   what might it be  



 it may be that you have friends or relatives to whom you intend to

bequeath all your possessions  



 friends  i have but one  and he s a prisoner like myself  relatives  i

have only cousins  and very distant cousins at that  so  say on  master

clerk  say on  



 monsieur  i am a poor man  father of a family  with five children  



 what then  



 i have never had any opportunities in my position  which i fill  as you

can testify  with scrupulous probity  all my confrères are promoted

over my head  



 why is that  



 why  ah  why  i will tell you  



 do so  



 because they are lucky  



 aha  



 and why are they lucky  



 that s what i would ask you  master clerk  



 and that s what i am about to tell you  master student  



 i shall be very glad to know  



 they are lucky    here the clerk lowered his voice a half tone

more    they are lucky because they have the rope a man was hanged with

in their pocket  do you understand  



 no  



 you re rather dull  you will make a will  eh  



 a will  why should i  



 dame  so that there may be no contest among your heirs  very good 

write in your will that you authorize marc boniface grimoineau  cleric

to monsieur le lieutenant criminel  to claim from the executioner a hit

of the rope you are hanged by  



 ah   said aubry  in a choking voice   yes  now i understand  



 and you will grant my request  



 to be sure  



 young man  remember what you have promised me  many have made the same

promise  but some have died intestate  others have written my name 

marc boniface grimoineau so badly that there was a chance for cavilling 

and others still  who were guilty  monsieur  on my word of honor very

guilty  have been acquitted  and gone off elsewhere to be hanged  so

that i was really in despair when you fell in my way  



 very well  master cleric  very well  if i am hanged  you shall have

what you want  never fear  



 oh  you will be  monsieur  you will he  don t you doubt it  



 well  grimoineau   said the judge 



 here i am  monsieur  here i am  so it s a bargain  master student  



 it s a bargain  



 on your word of honor  



 on my word  



 i think that i shall get it at last   muttered the clerk as he

withdrew   i will go home and tell my wife and children the good news  



he left the cell on the heels of the lieutenant criminal  who was

grumbling good humoredly at having to wait so long

capable of carrying devotion to the marrying point





aubry  once more alone  was soon more deeply absorbed in thought than

before  and the reader will agree that there was ample food for thought

in his conversation with the lieutenant criminal  we hasten to say 

however  that one who could have read his thoughts would have found that

the situation of ascanio and colombe  depending as it did upon the

letter in his possession  occupied the first place  and that before

thinking of himself  a thing which he proposed to do in good time  he

deliberated as to what was to be done for them 



he had been meditating thus for half an hour more or less  when the door

of his cell opened once more  and the turnkey appeared on the threshold 



 are you the man who sent for a priest   he growled 



 to be sure i am   said jacques 



 deuce take me  if i know what they all want with a damned monk  

muttered the turnkey   but what i do know is that they can t leave a

poor man in peace for five minutes  come in  come in  father   he

continued  standing aside to allow the priest to pass   and be quick

about it  



with that he closed the door  still grumbling  and left the new comer

alone with the prisoner 



 was it you who sent for me  my son   the priest asked 



 yes  father   replied the student 



 do you wish to confess  



 no  not just that  i wish to talk with you concerning a simple case of

conscience  



 say on  my son   said the priest  seating himself upon the stool   and

if any feeble light that i can give you will help you   



 it was to ask your advice that i ventured to send for you  



 i am listening  



 father   said aubry   i am a great sinner  



 alas   said the priest   happy is the man who acknowledges it  



 but that is not all  not only am i a great sinner myself  as i said 

but i have led others into sin  



 is there any way of undoing the harm you have done  



 i think so  father  i think so  she whom i dragged with me into the pit

was an innocent young girl  



 you seduced her  did you  



 seduced  yes  father  that is the word  



 and you wish to atone for your sin  



 that at least is my intention  



 there is but one way to do it  



 i know it well  and that is why i have been undecided so long  if there

were two ways i would have chosen the other  



 you wish to marry her  



 one moment  no  i will not lie  no  father  i do not wish to do it  but

i am resigned  



 a warmer  more devoted feeling would be much better  



 what would you have  father  there are people who are born to marry 

and others to remain single  celibacy was my vocation  and nothing less

than my present situation  i swear   



 very well  my son  the sooner the better  as you may repent of your

virtuous intentions  



 what will be the earliest possible moment   aubry asked 



 dame   said the priest   as it is a marriage  in extremis   there will

be no difficulty about the necessary dispensations  and i think that by

day after to morrow   



 day after to morrow let it be   said the student with a sigh 



 but the young woman  



 what of her  



 will she consent  



 to what  



 to the marriage  



 pardieu  will she consent  that she will  with thanks  such

propositions aren t made to her every day  



 then there is no obstacle  



 none  



 your parents  



 absent  



 and hers  



 unknown  



 her name  



 gervaise perrette popinot  



 do you wish me to tell her of your purpose  



 if you will kindly take that trouble  father  i shall be truly

grateful  



 she shall be informed this very day  



 tell me  father  tell me  could you possibly hand her a letter  



 no  my son  we who are admitted to minister to the prisoners have sworn

to deliver no message for them to any person until after their death 

when that time comes  i will do whatever you choose  



 thanks  it would be useless  marriage it must be  then   muttered

aubry 



 you have nothing else to say to me  



 nothing  except that  if you doubt the truth of what i say  and if she

makes any objection to granting my request  you will find in the office

of the lieutenant criminal a complaint lodged by said gervaise perrette

popinot  which will prove that what i have said is the exact truth  



 rely upon me to smooth away all obstacles   replied the priest  who

realized that jacques s proposed action was not prompted by enthusiasm

for the marriage  but that he was yielding to necessity   and two days

hence   



 two days hence   



 you will have restored  her honor to the woman whose honor you took

from her  



 alas   muttered the student with a deep sigh 



 ah  my son   said the priest   the more a sacrifice costs you  the

greater pleasure it affords to god  



 by mahomet s belly   cried jacques   in that case god should be very

grateful to me  go  father  go  



indeed  jacques had had to overcome very bitter opposition in his own

mind before arriving at such a resolution  as he had told gervaise  he

had inherited his antipathy to the marriage tie from his father  and

nothing less than his friendship for ascanio  and the thought that it

was he who had caused his ruin  together with the incentive afforded by

the noblest examples of self sacrificing devotion to be found in

history   nothing less than all of this was necessary to bring him to

the pitch of abnegation at which he had now arrived 



but  the reader may ask  where lies the connection between the marriage

of gervaise and aubry  and the happiness of ascanio and colombe  and how

did aubry expect to save his friend by marrying his mistress  to such a

question i can only answer that the reader lacks penetration  to which

the reader may retort  to be sure  that it is not his business to have

that quality  in that case  i beg him to take the trouble to read the

end of this chapter  which he might have passed over had he been endowed

with a more subtle intellect 



when the priest had gone  aubry  recognizing the impossibility of

drawing back  seemed to become more tranquil  it is characteristic of

resolutions  even the most momentous  to bring tranquillity in their

wake  the mind which has wrestled with its perplexity is at rest  the

heart which has fought against its sorrow is  as it were  benumbed 



jacques remained passive in his cell  until  having heard sounds in that

occupied by ascanio  which he supposed to be caused by the entrance of

the jailer with his breakfast  he concluded that they would surely be

left in peace for a few hours  he waited some little time after the

noise had ceased  then crawled into his underground gallery  passed

through it  and raised the mat with his head 



ascanio s cell was plunged in most intense darkness 



aubry called his friend s name in a low tone  but there was no reply 

the cell was untenanted 



aubry s first feeling was one of joy  ascanio was free  and if ascanio

was free there was no need for him to  but almost immediately he

remembered what was said the night before about providing him with

better quarters  it was plain that the suggestion of madame d etampes

had been heeded  and the sounds he heard were caused by his friend s

being moved 



aubry s hope was as dazzling  therefore  but as evanescent  as a flash

of lightning  he let the mat fall and crawled backward into his cell 

every source of consolation was taken from him  even the presence of the

friend for whom he had sacrificed himself 



he had no resource left but reflection  but he had already reflected so

long  and his reflections had led to such a disastrous result  that he

preferred to sleep 



he threw himself upon his bed  and as he was very much in arrears in the

matter of sleep  it was not long before he was entirely unconscious of

his surroundings  notwithstanding the perturbed condition of his mind 



he dreamed that he was condemned to death and hanged  but through the

deviltry of the hangman  the rope was badly greased  and his neck was

not broken  he was buried in due form  none the less  and in his dream

was beginning to gnaw his arms  as men buried alive always do  when the

clerk  determined to have his bit of rope  came to secure it  opened the

coffin in which he was immured  and restored his life and liberty 



alas  it was only a dream  and when the student awoke his life was still

in great danger  and his liberty altogether non existent 



the evening  the night  and the next day passed away  and brought him no

other visitor than his jailer  he tried to ask him a few questions  but

could not extract a word from him 



in the middle of the second night  as jacques was in the midst of his

first sleep  he was awakened with a start by the grinding of his door

upon its hinges  however soundly a prisoner may be sleeping  the sound

of an opening door always awakens him 



the student sat up in bed 



 up with you  and dress yourself   said the jailer s harsh voice  and

aubry could see by the light of the torch he held  the halberds of two

of the provost s guards behind him 



the second branch of his order was unnecessary  as the student s bed was

entirely unprovided with bedclothes  he had lain down completely

dressed 



 where do you propose to take me  pray   demanded jacques  still asleep

with one eye 



 you are very inquisitive   said the jailer 



 but i would like to know  



 come  come  no arguing  but follow me  



resistance was useless  so the prisoner obeyed 



the jailer walked first  then came aubry  and the two guards brought up

the rear of the procession 



jacques looked around with an inquietude which he did not seek to

conceal  he feared a nocturnal execution  but one thing comforted him 

he saw no priest or hangman 



after a few moments he found himself in the first room to which he was

taken at the time of his coming to the prison  but instead of escorting

him to the outer door  which he hoped for an instant that they would do 

so prone to illusions does misfortune render one  his guide opened a

door at one corner of the room and entered an inner corridor leading to

a courtyard 



the prisoner s first thought on entering the courtyard  where he felt

the fresh air and saw the starlit sky  was to fill his lungs  and lay in

a stock of oxygen  not knowing when he might have another opportunity 



the next moment he noticed the ogive windows of a fourteenth century

chapel on the other side of the yard  and began to suspect what was in

the wind 



the truth telling instinct of the historian compels us to state that at

the thought his strength wellnigh failed him 



however  the memory of ascanio and colombe  and the grandeur of the

self sacrifice about to be consummated  sustained him in his distress 

he walked with a firm step toward the chapel  and when he stood in the

doorway everything was explained 



the priest stood by the altar  in the choir a woman was waiting  the

woman was gervaise 



half way up the choir he met the governor of the châtelet 



 you desired to make reparation  before your death  to the young woman

whose honor you stole from her  your request was no more than just and

it is granted  



a cloud passed over the student s eyes  but he put his hand over madame

d etampes s letter  and his courage returned 



 oh  my poor jacques   cried gervaise  throwing herself into the

student s arms   oh  who could have dreamed that this hour which i have

so longed for would strike under such circumstances  



 what wouldst thou have  my dear gervaise   cried the student  receiving

her upon his breast   god knows those whom he should punish and those

whom he should reward  we must submit to god s will  



 take this   he added beneath his breath  slipping madame d etampes s

letter into her hand   for benvenuto and for him alone  



 what s that   exclaimed the governor  walking hastily toward them 

 what s the matter  



 nothing  i was telling gervaise how i love her  



 as she will not  in all probability  have time to ascertain the

contrary  protestations are thrown away  go to the altar and make

haste  



aubry and gervaise went forward in silence to the waiting priest  when

they were in front of him they fell upon their knees and the mass began 



jacques would have been very glad of an opportunity to exchange a few

words with gervaise  who  for her part  was burning up with the desire

to express her gratitude to aubry  but two guards stood beside them

listening to every word and watching every movement  it was very

fortunate that a momentary feeling of sympathy led the governor to allow

them to exchange the embrace under cover of which the letter passed from

jacques s hands to gervaise s  that opportunity lost  the close

surveillance to which they were subjected would have rendered jacques s

devotion of no avail 



the priest had received his instructions  doubtless  for he cut his

discourse very short  it may be  too  that he thought it would be

trouble thrown away to enjoin due regard to his duties as a husband and

father upon a man who was to be hanged within two or three days 



the discourse at an end  the benediction given  the mass said  aubry and

gervaise thought they would be allowed to speak together privately for a

moment  but not so  despite the tears of gervaise  who was literally

dissolved in them  the guards forced them to part 



they had time  however  to exchange a glance  aubry s said   remember my

commission   gervaise s replied   never fear  it shall be done to night 

or to morrow at latest  



then they were led away in opposite directions  gervaise was politely

escorted to the street door  and jacques was politely taken back to his

cell 



as the door closed upon him  he heaved a deeper sigh than any of those

he had perpetrated since he entered the prison  he was married 



thus it was that aubry  like another curtius  plunged headlong  through

devotion  into the hymeneal gulf 









xviii





the casting





now  with our readers  permission  we will leave the châtelet for a

moment  and return to the hôtel de nesle 



the workmen responded quickly to benvenuto s cries  and followed him to

the foundry 



they all knew him as he appeared when at work  but never had they seen

such an expression upon his face  never such a flame in his eyes 

whoever could have cast him in a mould at that moment  as he was on the

point of casting his jupiter  would have endowed the world with the

noblest statue ever created by the genius of an artist 



everything was ready  the wax model in its envelope of clay  girt round

with iron bands  was awaiting in the furnace which surrounded it the

hour of its life  the wood was all arranged  benvenuto set fire to it in

four different places  and as it was spruce  which the artist had been

long collecting that it might be thoroughly dry  the fire quickly

attacked every part of the furnace  and the mould was soon the centre of

an immense blaze  the wax thereupon began to run out through the

air holes while the mould was baking  at the same time the workmen were

digging a long ditch beside the furnace  into which the metal was to be

poured in a state of fusion  for benvenuto was anxious not to lose a

moment  and to proceed to the casting as soon as the mould was

thoroughly baked 



for a day and a half the wax trickled from the mould  for a day and a

half  while the workmen divided into watches and took turn and turn

about like the sailors on a man of war  benvenuto was constantly on

hand  hovering about the furnace  feeding the fire  encouraging the

workmen  at last he found that the wax had all run out  and that the

mould was thoroughly baked  this completed the second part of his work 

the last part was the melting of the bronze and the casting of the

statue  when that stage was reached the workmen  who were utterly unable

to comprehend such superhuman strength and such an intensity of passion 

endeavored to induce benvenuto to take a few hours  rest  but that would

mean so many hours added to ascanio s captivity and the persecution of

colombe  benvenuto refused  he seemed to be made of the same bronze of

which he was about to make a god 



when the ditch was dug  he wound stout ropes about the mould  and with

the aid of windlasses prepared for that purpose  he raised it with every

possible precaution  swung it out over the ditch  and let it down slowly

until it was on a level with the furnace  he fixed it firmly in place

there by piling around it the dirt taken from the ditch  treading it

down  and putting in place  as the dirt rose about the mould  the pieces

of earthen pipe which were to serve as air holes  all these preparations

took the rest of the day  night came  for forty eight hours benvenuto

had not slept nor lain down  nor even sat down  the workmen implored 

scozzone scolded  but benvenuto would hear none of it  he seemed to be

sustained by some more than human power  and made no other reply to the

entreaties and scolding than to assign to each workman his task  in the

short  stern tone of an officer manœuvring his troops 



benvenuto was determined to begin the casting at once  the energetic

artist  who was accustomed to see all obstacles yield before him 

exerted his imperious power upon himself  he ordered his body to act 

and it obeyed  while his companions were obliged to withdraw  one after

another  as in battle wounded soldiers leave the field and seek the

hospital 



the casting furnace was ready  it was filled with round ingots of brass

and copper  symmetrically piled one upon another  so that the heat could

pass between them  and the fusion be effected more quickly and more

completely  he set fire to the wood around it as in the case of the

other furnace  and as it was mostly spruce  the resin which exuded from

it  in conjunction with the combustible nature of the wood  soon made

such a fierce flame that it rose higher than was anticipated  and lapped

the roof of the foundry  which took fire at once  being of wood  at the

sight of this conflagration  and more especially at the heat which it

gave forth  all the artist s comrades  save hermann  drew back  but

hermann and benvenuto were a host in themselves  each of them seized an

axe and cut away at the wooden pillars which upheld the roof  and in an

instant it fell in  thereupon hermann and benvenuto with poles pushed

the burning fragments into the furnace  and with the increased heat the

metal began to melt 



but benvenuto had at last reached the limit of his strength  for nearly

sixty hours he had not slept  for twenty four he had not eaten  and

during the whole of that time he was the soul of the whole performance 

the axis upon which the whole operation turned  a terrible fever took

possession of him  a deathly pallor succeeded to his usual high color 

in an atmosphere so intensely hot that no one could live beside him  he

felt his limbs tremble and his teeth chatter as if he were amid the

snows of lapland  his companions remarked his condition and drew near to

him  he tried to resist  to deny that he was beaten  for in his eyes it

was a disgrace to yield even before the impossible  but at last he was

fain to confess that his strength was failing him  fortunately  the

fusion was nearly accomplished  the most difficult part of the operation

was past  and what remained to be done was mere mechanical work  he

called pagolo  pagolo did not reply  but the workmen shouted his name in

chorus and he at last appeared  he said that he had been praying for the

successful issue of the casting 



 this is no time to pray   cried benvenuto   and the lord said   he who

works prays   this is the time for work  pagolo  hark ye  i feel that i

am dying  but whether i die or not  my jupiter must live  pagolo  my

friend  to thee i intrust the management of the casting  sure that thou

canst do it as well as i  if thou wilt  understand  pagolo  the metal

will soon be ready  thou canst not mistake the proper degree of heat 

when it is red thou wilt give a sledge hammer to hermann  and one to

simon le gaucher   my god  what was i saying  ah  yes   then they must

knock out the two plugs of the furnace  the metal will flow out  and if

i am dead you will tell the king that he promised me a boon  and that

you claim it in my name  and that it  is  o my god  i no longer

remember  what was i to ask the king  ah  yes   ascanio  seigneur de

nesle  colombe  the provost s daughter  d orbec  madame d etampes  ah  i

am going mad  



benvenuto staggered and fell into hermann s arms  who carried him off

like a child to his room  while pagolo  intrusted with the

superintendence of the work  gave orders for it to go on 



benvenuto was right  he was going mad  or rather a terrible delirium had

taken possession of him  scozzone  who doubtless had been praying as

pagolo had  hurried to his side  but benvenuto continued to cry   i am

dying  i am dying  ascanio  ascanio  what will become of ascanio  



a thousand delirious visions were crowding in upon his brain  ascanio 

colombe  stefana  all appeared and disappeared like ghosts  in the

throng which passed before his eyes was pompeo the goldsmith  whom he

slew with his dagger  and the keeper of the post house at sienna  whom

he slew with his arquebus  past and present were confounded in his

brain  how it was clement vii  who detained ascanio in prison  again it

was cosmo i  who sought to force colombe to marry d orbec  then he would

appeal to queen eleanora  thinking he was addressing madame d etampes 

and would implore and threaten her by turns  then he would make sport of

poor weeping scozzone  and bid her beware lest pagolo should break his

neck clambering around on the cornices like a cat  intervals of complete

prostration would succeed these paroxysms  and it would seem as if he

were at the point of death 



this agonizing state of affairs endured three hours  benvenuto was in

one of his periods of torpor when pagolo suddenly rushed into the room 

pale and agitated  crying   



 may jesus and the virgin help us  master  for all is lost now  and we

can look nowhere but to heaven for help  



worn out  half conscious  dying as he was  these words  like a sharp

stiletto  reached the very bottom of his heart  the veil which clouded

his intellect was torn away  and  like lazarus rising at the voice of

the lord  he rose upon his bed  crying   



 who dares to say that all is lost when benvenuto still lives  



 alas  i  master   said pagolo 



 double traitor   cried benvenuto   is it written that thou shalt

forever prove false to me  but never fear  jesus and the virgin whom you

invoked just now are at hand  to bear aid to men of good will  and

punish traitors  



at that moment he heard the workmen lamenting and crying   



 benvenuto  benvenuto  



 he is here  he is here   cried the artist  rushing from his room  pale

of face  but with renewed strength and clearness of vision   here he is 

and woe to them who have not done their duty  



in two hounds benvenuto was at the foundry  he found all the workmen 

whom he had left so full of vigor and enthusiasm  in a state of utter

stupefaction and dejection  even hermann the colossus seemed to be dying

of fatigue  he was tottering on his legs and was compelled to lean

against one of the supports of the roof which remained standing 



 now listen to what i say   cried benvenuto in an awful voice  falling

into their midst like a thunderbolt   i don t as yet know what has

happened  but i swear to you beforehand that it can be remedied 

whatever it may he   upon my soul it can  now that i am present  obey me

on your lives  but obey passively  without a word  without a gesture 

for the first man who hesitates i will kill 



 so much for the ill disposed 



 i have but one word to say to those who are disposed to do their duty 

the liberty and happiness of ascanio  your companion of whom you are all

so fond  will follow the successful issue of this task  to work  



with that cellini approached the furnace to form his own opinion of what

had taken place  the supply of wood had given out  and the metal had

cooled  so that it had turned to cake  as the professional phrase goes 



benvenuto at once determined that the disaster could be repaired 

pagolo s watchfulness had relaxed in all likelihood  and he had allowed

the heat of the fire to abate  the thing to be done was to make the fire

as hot as ever  and to reduce the metal to a liquid state once more 



 wood   cried benvenuto   wood  go look for wood wherever it can

possibly be found  go to the bakers  and buy it by the pound if

necessary  bring every stick of wood that there is in the house to the

smallest chip  break in the doors of the petit nesle  hermann  if dame

perrine doesn t choose to open them  everything in that direction is

lawful prize  for it s an enemy s country  wood  wood  



to set the example benvenuto seized an axe and attacked the two posts

which were still standing  they soon fell with the last remnants of the

roof  and benvenuto at once pushed the whole mass into the fire  at the

same time his comrades returned from all directions laden with wood 



 ah   cried benvenuto   now are you ready to obey me  



 yes  yes   cried every voice   yes  we will do whatever you bid us do 

so long as we have a breath of life in our bodies  



 select the oak then  and throw on nothing but oak at first  that burns

more quickly  and consequently will repair the damage sooner  



immediately oak began to rain down upon the fire  and benvenuto was

obliged to cry enough 



his energy infected all his comrades  his orders  even his gestures 

were understood and executed on the instant  pagolo alone muttered from

time to time between his teeth   



 you are trying to perform impossibilities  master  it is tempting

providence  



to which cellini s only reply was a look which seemed to say   never

fear  we have an account to settle hereafter  



meanwhile  notwithstanding pagolo s sinister predictions  the metal

began to fuse anew  and to hasten the fusion benvenuto at intervals

threw a quantity of lead into the furnace  stirring up the lead and

copper and brass with a long bar of iron  so that  to borrow his

expression  the metal corpse began to come to life again  at sight of

the progress that was making  benvenuto was so elate that he was

unconscious of fever or weakness  he too came to life once more 



at last the metal began to boil and seethe  benvenuto at once opened the

orifice of the mould and ordered the plugs of the furnace to be knocked

out  which was done on the instant  but  as if this immense work was to

be a veritable combat of titans to the end  benvenuto perceived  as soon

as the plugs were removed  not only that the metal did not run freely

enough  but that there was some question as to whether there was enough

of it  thereupon  with one of those heaven sent inspirations which come

to none but artists  he cried   



 let half of you remain here to feed the fire  and the rest follow me  



with that he rushed into the house  followed by five of his men  and an

instant later they all reappeared  laden with silver plate  pewter 

bullion  and pieces of work half completed  benvenuto himself set the

example  and each one cast his precious burden into the furnace  which

instantly devoured everything  bronze  lead  silver  rough pig metal 

and beautiful works of art  with the same indifference with which it

would have devoured the artist himself if he had thrown himself in 



thanks to this reinforcement of fusible matter  the metal became

thoroughly liquefied  and  as if it repented of its momentary

hesitation  began to flow freely  there ensued a period of breathless

suspense  which became something very like terror when benvenuto

perceived that all of the bronze did not reach the orifice of the mould 

he sounded with a long rod and found that the mould was entirely filled

without exhausting the supply of metal 



thereupon he fell upon his knees and thanked god  the work was finished

which was to save ascanio and colombe  now would god permit that the

result should fulfil his hopes 



it was impossible to know until the following day 



the night that followed was  as can readily be imagined  a night of

agony  and  worn out as benvenuto was  he slept for a very few moments

only  and his sleep even for those few moments was far from being

restful  his eyes were hardly closed before real objects gave place to

imaginary ones  he saw his jupiter  the king of the gods in beauty as

well as power  as shapeless and deformed as his son vulcan  in his dream

he was unable to understand this catastrophe  was it the fault of the

mould  was it the fault of the casting  had he made a miscalculation  or

was destiny making sport of him  at the sight his temples throbbed

furiously  and he awoke with his heart jumping  and bathed in

perspiration  for some time his mind was so confused that he could not

separate fact from vision  at last  however  he remembered that his

jupiter was still hidden in the mould  like a child in its mother s

womb  he recalled all the precautions he had taken  he implored god not

only to make his work successful  but to do a merciful deed  thereupon

he became somewhat calmer  and fell asleep again  under the weight of

the never ending weariness which seemed to have laid hold on him

forever  only to fall into a second dream as absurd and as terrifying as

the first 



day broke at last  and with its coming benvenuto shook himself clear of

all symptoms of drowsiness  in an instant he was on his feet and fully

dressed  and hastened at once to the foundry 



the bronze was evidently still too hot to be exposed to the air  but

benvenuto was in such haste to ascertain what he had still to fear  or

what he might hope  that he could not contain himself  and began to

uncover the head  when he put his hand to the mould he was so pale that

one would have thought him at the point of death 



 are you still sick  master   inquired a voice  which he recognized as

hermann s   you vould do much petter to stay in your ped  



 you are wrong  hermann  my boy   said benvenuto  amazed to find him

astir so early   for i should die in my bed  but how happens it that you

are out of bed at this hour  



 i vas taking a valk   said hermann  blushing to the whites of his eyes 

 i like much to valk  shall i help you  master  



 no  no   cried benvenuto   no one but myself is to touch the mould 

wait  wait  



and he began gently to uncover the head  by a miraculous chance there

was just the necessary amount of metal  if it had not occurred to him to

throw all his silver plate and other objects into the furnace  the head

would have been missing and the casting a failure 



fortunately the head was not missing  and was wonderfully beautiful 





 illustration 07 





the sight of it encouraged benvenuto to expose the other portions of the

body one after another  little by little the mould fell away like bark 

and at last jupiter  freed from head to foot from his trammels  appeared

in all the majesty befitting the sovereign of olympus  in no part of the

work had the bronze betrayed the artist  and when the last morsel of

clay fell away  all the workmen joined in a shout of admiration  for

they had come out one by one and gathered about cellini  who did not

even notice their presence  so absorbed was he by the thoughts to which

this complete success gave rise 



but at the shout  which made him too a god  he raised his head  and said

with a proud smile   



 we shall see if the king of france will refuse the first boon asked by

the man who has made such a statue  



the next instant  as if he repented his first impulse of pride  which

was entirely characteristic of him  he fell upon his knees  and with

clasped hands rendered thanks to the lord aloud 



as he was finishing his prayer scozzone ran out to say that  madame 

jacques aubry desired to speak to him in private  having a letter from

her husband  which she could hand to none but benvenuto 



benvenuto made scozzone repeat the name twice  for he had no idea that

the student was in the hands of a lawful wife 



he obeyed the summons none the less  leaving his companions swollen with

pride in their master s renown  pagolo meanwhile  on scrutinizing the

statue more closely  observed that there was an imperfection in the

heel  some accident having prevented the metal from filling every part

of the mould

jupiter and olympus





on the same day that benvenuto removed his statue from the mould  he

sent word to françois i  that his jupiter was cast  and asked him on

what day it was his pleasure that the king of olympus should appear

before the king of france 



françois replied that his cousin  the emperor  and he were to hunt in

the forest of fontainebleau on the following thursday  and that he need

do nothing more than have his statue transported to the grand gallery of

the château on that day 



the reply was very short  it was evident that madame d etampes had

strongly prejudiced the king against his favorite artist  but

benvenuto  was it through pride or confidence in god   said simply  with

a smile   



 it is well  



it was monday  benvenuto caused the jupiter to be loaded upon a wagon 

and rode beside it  not leaving it for an instant  lest some mishap

might befall it  on thursday  at ten o clock  statue and artist were at

fontainebleau 



to any one who saw benvenuto  though it were only to see him ride by  it

was evident that pride and radiant hope were triumphant in his heart 

his conscience as an artist told him that he had executed a

 chef d œuvre   and his honest heart that he was about to perform a

meritorious action  he was doubly joyous  therefore  and carried his

head high  like a man who  having no hatred in his heart  was equally

without fear  the king was to see his jupiter  and could not fail to be

pleased with it  montmorency and poyet would remind him of his promise 

the emperor and the whole court would be present  and françois could

not do otherwise than as he had given his word to do 



madame d etampes  with less innocent delight  but with quite as much

ardent passion  was maturing her plans  she had triumphed over benvenuto

at the time of his first attempt to confound her by presenting himself

at her own hôtel and at the louvre  the first danger was safely past 

but she felt that the king s promise to benvenuto was a second equally

great danger  and it was her purpose  at any cost  to induce his majesty

to disregard it  she therefore repaired to fontainebleau one day in

advance of cellini  and laid her wires with the profound feminine craft

which in her case almost amounted to genius 



cellini was destined very soon to feel its effects 



he had no sooner crossed the threshold of the gallery where his jupiter

was to be exhibited  than he felt the blow  recognized the hand that had

dealt it  and stood for a moment overwhelmed 



this gallery  ordinarily resplendent with paintings by rosso  which were

in themselves enough to distract the attention from almost any

masterpiece  had been embellished during the last three days by statues

sent from rome by primaticcio   that is to say  the marvels of antique

sculpture  the types sanctified by the admiration of twenty centuries 

were there before him  challenging comparison  crushing all rivalry 

ariadne  venus  hercules  apollo  even jupiter himself  the great

olympian jove   ideal figures  dreams of genius  eternities in

bronze   formed  as it were  a supernatural assemblage which it was

impious to approach  a sublime tribunal whose judgment every artist

should dread 



there was something like profanation and blasphemy in the thought of

another jupiter insinuating himself into that olympus  of benvenuto

throwing down the gauntlet to phidias  and  notwithstanding his trust in

his own merit  the devout artist recoiled 



furthermore  the immortal statues had taken possession of all the best

places  as it was their right to do  and there was no place left for

cellini s poor jupiter but some dark corner which could only be reached

by passing under the stately and imposing glances of the ancient gods 



benvenuto stood in the doorway with bowed head  and with an expression

in which sadness and artistic gratification were mingled 



 messire antoine le maçon   he said to the king s secretary  who stood

beside him   i ought to and will send my jupiter back instantly  the

disciple will not attempt to contend with the masters  the child will

not attempt to contend with his parents  my pride and my modesty alike

forbid  



 benvenuto   replied the secretary   take the advice of a sincere

friend   if you do that  you are lost  i tell you this between

ourselves  that your enemies hope to discourage you  and then to allege

your discouragement as a proof of your lack of skill  it will be useless

for me to make excuses for you to the king  his majesty  who is

impatient to see your work  would refuse to listen  and  with madame

d etampes continually urging him to do it  would withdraw his favor from

you forever  she anticipates that result  and i fear it  it s with the

living  not with the dead  benvenuto  that you have to contend  



 you are right  messire   the goldsmith rejoined   and i understand you

perfectly  thank you for reminding me that i have no right to have any

self esteem here  



 that s all right  benvenuto  but let me give you one more bit of

advice  madame d etampes is too fascinating to day not to have some

perfidious scheme in her head  she took the king and the emperor off for

a ride in the forest with irresistible playfulness and charm  i am

afraid for your sake that she will find a way to keep them there until

dark  



 do you think it   cried benvenuto  turning pale   why  if she succeeds

in doing that  i am lost  for my statue would then have to be exhibited

by artificial light  which would deprive it of half its merit  



 let us hope that i am mistaken   said le maçon   and see what comes to

pass  



cellini waited in painful suspense  he placed his jupiter in as

favorable a light as possible  but he did not conceal from himself the

fact that its effect would be comparatively slight by twilight  and that

after nightfall it would be positively bad  the duchess s hatred had

reckoned no less accurately than the artist s skill  she anticipated in

1541 a trick of the critics of the nineteenth century 



benvenuto watched the sun sink toward the horizon with despair at his

heart  and listened eagerly to every sound without the château  except

for the servants the vast structure was deserted 



three o clock struck  thenceforth the purpose of madame d etampes could

not be mistaken  and her success was beyond question  benvenuto fell

upon a chair  utterly crushed  all was lost  his renown first of all 

that feverish struggle  in which he had been so near succumbing  and

which he had already forgotten because he had thought that it made his

triumph sure  would have no other result than to put him to shame  he

gazed sorrowfully at his statue  around which the shadows of night were

already beginning to fall  and whose lines began to appear less pure 



suddenly an inspiration came to him  he sprang to his feet  called

little jehan  whom he had brought with him  and rushed hastily from the

gallery  nothing had yet occurred to suggest the king s return 

benvenuto hurried to a cabinet maker in the town  and with his

assistance and that of his workmen made  in less than an hour  a stand

of light colored oak  with four rollers  which turned in every

direction  like casters 



he trembled now lest the king should return too soon  but at five

o clock the work was completed  night had fallen  and the crowned heads

had not returned to the château  madame d etampes  wherever she was 

was in a fair way to triumph 



in a very short time benvenuto had the statue in place upon the almost

invisible stand  jupiter held in his left hand the sphere representing

the world  and in his right  a little above his head  the thunderbolt 

which he seemed to be on the point of launching into space  amid the

tongues of the thunderbolt the goldsmith concealed a lamp 



these preparations were hardly completed when a flourish of trumpets

announced the return of the king and the emperor  benvenuto lighted the

lamp  stationed little jehan behind the statue  by which he was entirely

concealed  and awaited the king s coming  not without trepidation 

evidenced by the violent beating of his heart 



ten minutes later the folding doors were thrown wide open  and françois

i  appeared  leading charles v  by the hand 



the dauphin  dauphine  the king of navarre  and the whole court followed

the two monarchs  the provost  his daughter  and d orbec were among the

last  colombe was pale and dejected  but as soon as she espied cellini 

she raised her head  and a smile of sublime confidence appeared upon her

lips and lighted up her face 



cellini met her glance with one which seemed to say   have no fear 

whatever happens  do not despair  for i am watching over you  



as the door opened  little jehan  at a signal from his master  gave the

statue a slight push  so that it moved softly forward upon its smoothly

rolling stand  and  leaving the antique statues behind  went to meet the

king  so to speak  as if it were alive  every eye was at once turned in

its direction  the soft light of the lamp falling from above produced an

effect much more agreeable than daylight 



madame d etampes bit her lips 



 methinks  sire   said she   that the flattery is a little overdone  and

that it was for the king of earth to go to meet the king of heaven  



the king smiled  but it was easy to see that the flattery did not offend

him  as his wont was  he forgot the artist for his art  saved the statue

half the journey by walking to meet it  and examined it for a long time

in silence  charles v   who was by nature an astute politician rather

than a great artist  although he did one day  in a moment of good humor 

pick up titian s pencil   charles v  and the courtiers  who were not

entitled to an opinion  waited respectfully to hear that of françois

before pronouncing their own 



there was a moment of silent suspense  during which benvenuto and the

duchess exchanged a glance of bitter hatred 



suddenly the king cried   



 it is beautiful  it is very beautiful  and i confess that my

expectations are surpassed  



thereupon every one overflowed in compliments and extravagant praise 

the emperor first of all 



 if one could conquer artists like cities   said he to the king   i

would declare war on you instantly  to win this one  my cousin  



 but  after all   interrupted madame d etampes  in a rage   we do not

even look at the beautiful antique statues a little farther on  which

have somewhat more merit  perhaps  than our modern gewgaws  



the king thereupon walked toward the antique statues  which were lighted

from below by the torches  so that the upper portions were in shadow 

they were beyond question much less effective than the jupiter 



 phidias is sublime   said the king   but there may be a phidias in the

age of françois i  and charles v   as there was in the age of

pericles  



 oh  we must see it by daylight   said anne  bitterly   to appear to be

is not to be  an artificial light is not art  and what is that veil  is

it to conceal some defect  master cellini  tell us frankly  



she referred to a very light drapery thrown over the statue to give it

more majesty 



thus far benvenuto had remained beside his statue  silent  and

apparently as cold as it  but at the duchess s words  he smiled

disdainfully  shot lightning from his black eyes  and  with the sublime

audacity of a heathen artist  snatched the veil away with his powerful

hand 



he expected that the duchess would burst forth with renewed fury 



but by an incredible exertion of her will power  she smiled with ominous

affability  and graciously held out her hand to cellini  who was amazed

beyond measure by this sudden change of tactics 



 i was wrong   she said aloud  in the tone of a spoiled child   you are

a great sculptor  cellini  forgive my critical remarks  give me your

hand  and let us be friends henceforth  what say you  



she added in an undertone  with extreme volubility   think well of what

you are about to ask  cellini  let it not be the marriage of colombe and

ascanio  or i swear that colombe  ascanio  and yourself  all three  are

undone forever  



 and suppose i request something else  madame   said benvenuto  in the

same tone   will you second my request  



 yes   said she  eagerly   and i swear that  whatever it may be  the

king will grant it  



 i have no need to request the king s sanction to the marriage of

colombe and ascanio  for you will request it yourself  madame  



the duchess smiled disdainfully 



 what are you whispering there   said françois 



 madame la duchesse d etampes   benvenuto replied   was obliging enough

to remind me that your majesty had promised to grant me a boon in case

you were content with my work  



 and the promise was made in my presence  sire   said the constable 

coming forward   in my presence and chancelier poyet s  indeed  you bade

my colleague and myself remind you   



 true  constable   interposed the king  good humoredly   true  if i

failed to remember myself  but i remember famously  on my word  so your

intervention  while it is perfectly agreeable to me  is quite useless 

i promised benvenuto to grant whatever boon he might ask when his

jupiter was cast  was not that it  constable  have i a good memory 

chancellor  it is for you to speak  master cellini  i am at your

service  but i beg you to think less of your own merit  which is

immense  than of our power  which is limited  we make no reservations 

saving our crown and our mistress  



 very good  sire   said cellini   since your majesty is so well disposed

toward your unworthy servitor  i will ask for the pardon of a poor

student  who fell into a dispute upon the quai du châtelet with the

vicomte de marmagne  and in self defence passed his sword through the

viscount s body  



every one marvelled at the moderation of his request  and madame

d etampes most of all  she gazed at benvenuto with an air of

stupefaction  and as if she thought that she could not have heard

aright 



 by mahomet s belly   exclaimed françois   you do well to invoke my

right of pardon in that matter  for i heard the chancellor himself say

yesterday that it was a hanging affair  



 oh  sire   cried the duchess   i intended to speak to you myself

concerning that young man  i have had news of marmagne  who is

improving  and who sent word to me that he sought the quarrel  and the

student  what is the student s name  master benvenuto  



 jacques aubry  madame la duchesse  



 and the student   continued madame d etampes  hurriedly   was in no

wise in the wrong  and so  sire  instead of rebuking benvenuto  or

cavilling at him  grant his request promptly  lest he repent of having

been of modest  



 very well   said françois   what you desire shall be done  master  and

as he gives twice who gives quickly   so says the proverb   let the

order to set this young man at liberty be despatched to night  do you

hear  my dear chancellor  



 yes  sire  and your majesty shall be obeyed  



 as to yourself  master benvenuto   said françois   come to me on

monday at the louvre  and we will adjust certain matters of detail in

which you are interested  and which have been somewhat neglected of late

by my treasurer  



 but your majesty knows that admission to the louvre   



 very good  very good  the person who gave the order can rescind it  it

was a war measure  and as you now have none but friends at court 

everything will be re established upon a peace footing  



 as your majesty is in a granting mood   said the duchess   i pray you

to grant a trifling request which i prefer  although i did not make the

jupiter  



 no   said benvenuto in an undertone   but you have often acted the part

of danaë  



 what is your request   said françois  who did not hear benvenuto s

epigram   say on  madame la duchesse  and be sure that the solemnity of

the occasion can add nothing to my desire to be agreeable to you  



 very well  sire  your majesty might well confer upon messire

d estourville the great honor of signing on monday next the marriage

contract of my young friend  mademoiselle d estourville  with comte

d orbec  



 why  i should be conferring no favor upon you by so doing   rejoined

the king   but i should afford myself a very great pleasure  and should

still remain your debtor  i swear  



 so it is agreed  sire  for monday   asked the duchess 



 for monday   said the king 



 madame la duchesse   said benvenuto  under his breath   do you not

regret that the beautiful lily you ordered ascanio to execute is not

finished  that you might wear it upon such an occasion  



 of course i regret it   was the reply   but it s impossible  for

ascanio is in prison  



 very true  but i am free  i will finish it and bring it to madame la

duchesse  



 oh  upon my honor  if you do that i will say   



 you will say what  madame  



 i will say that you are a delightful man  



she gave her hand to benvenuto  who gallantly imprinted a kiss upon it 

after asking the king s permission with a glance 



at that moment a slight shriek was heard 



 what is that   the king asked 



 sire  i ask your majesty s pardon   said the provost   but my daughter

is ill  



 poor child   murmured benvenuto   she thinks that i have abandoned

her  









xx





a prudent marriage





benvenuto would have returned to paris the same evening  but the king

was so persistent that he could not avoid remaining at the château

until the following morning 



with the rapidity of conception and promptness of decision which were

characteristic of him  he determined to arrange for the next day the

 dénouement  of a transaction which he began long before  it was a

collateral matter which he wished to have off his hands altogether

before devoting himself entirely to ascanio and colombe 



he remained at the château to supper on that evening and until after

breakfast on the friday  and not until noon did he set out on his return

journey  accompanied by little jehan  after taking leave of the king and

madame d etampes 



both were well mounted  and yet  contrary to his wont  cellini did not

urge his horse  it was evident that he did not wish to enter paris

before a certain hour  and it was seven o clock in the evening when he

alighted at rue de la harpe 



furthermore  instead of betaking himself at once to the hôtel de nesle 

he called upon one of his friends named guido  a physician from

florence  and when he had made sure that his friend was at home  and

could conveniently entertain him at supper  he ordered little jehan to

return alone  to say that he had remained at fontainebleau and would not

return until the next day  and to be ready to open the door when he

should knock  little jehan at once set out for the hôtel de nesle 

promising to abide by his instructions 



the supper was served   but before they took their places at the table

cellini asked his host if he did not know some honest and skilful notary

whom he could send for to prepare a contract that could not be assailed 

he recommended his son in law  who was immediately summoned 



he arrived as they were finishing their supper  some half hour later 

benvenuto at once left the table  closeted himself with him  and bade

him draw up a marriage contract leaving the names in blank  when they

had read and re read the contract  as drawn up  to make sure that there

was no flaw in it  benvenuto paid him handsomely  put the contract in

his pocket  borrowed from his friend a second sword of just the length

of his own  put it under his cloak  and  as it had become quite dark 

started for the hôtel de nesle 



when he reached his destination  he knocked once  but though he knocked

very gently  the door immediately opened  little jehan was at his post 



cellini questioned him  the workmen were at supper and did not expect

him until the morrow  he bade the child maintain the most absolute

silence as to his arrival  then crept up to catherine s room  to which

he had retained a key  entered softly  closed the door  concealed

himself behind the hangings  and waited 



after a short time  he heard a light footstep on the staircase  the door

opened a second time  and scozzone entered  lamp in hand  she took the

key from the outside  locked the door  placed the lamp on the

chimneypiece  and sat down in a large arm chair  so placed that

benvenuto could see her face 



to his vast astonishment  that face  formerly so open and joyous and

animated  was sad and thoughtful  the fact was that poor scozzone was in

the throes of something very like remorse 



we have seen her when she was happy and thoughtless  then benvenuto

loved her  so long as she was conscious of that love  or rather of that

kindly feeling in her lover s heart  so long as the hope of becoming the

sculptor s wife some day was present like a golden cloud in all her

dreams  so long she maintained herself at the level of her

anticipations  and made atonement for her past by her love  but as soon

as she discovered that she had been deceived by appearances  and that

what she had mistaken for passion on cellini s part was at most a mere

whim  she descended the ladder of hope round by round  benvenuto s

smile  which had made that faded heart blossom anew  was taken from her 

and the heart lost its freshness once more 



with her childish light heartedness her childish purity had gradually

vanished  her old nature  powerfully assisted by ennui  gently recovered

the upper hand  a newly painted wall keeps its colors in the sun and

loses them in the rain  scozzone  abandoned by cellini for some unknown

mistress  was no longer held to him save by a remnant of her pride 

pagolo had long paid court to her  she spoke to cellini of his love 

thinking that his jealousy would be aroused  her expectation was not

realized  cellini  instead of losing his temper  began to laugh  and 

instead of forbidding her to see pagolo  actually ordered her to receive

him  thereafter she felt that she was entirely lost  thereafter she

abandoned her life to chance with her former indifference  and let it

blow about in the wind of circumstances like a poor  fallen withered

leaf 



then it was that pagolo triumphed over her indifference  after all was

said  pagolo was young  pagolo  aside from his hypocritical expression 

was a handsome youth  pagolo was in love  and was forever repeating to

her that he loved her  while benvenuto had long since ceased to tell her

so  the words   i love you   are the language of the heart  and the

heart always feels the need of speaking that language more or less

ardently with some one 



thus  in a moment of idleness  of anger  perhaps of illusion  scozzone

had told pagolo that she loved him  she had told him so without really

loving him  she had told him so with cellini s image in her heart and

his name upon her lips 



then it immediately occurred to her that the day might come when

cellini  weary of his mysterious  unavailing passion  would return to

her  and  if he found her constant  notwithstanding his express orders 

would reward her devotion  not by marriage  for the poor girl had lost

her last illusion in that regard  but by some remnant of esteem and

compassion which she might take for a resurrection of his former love 



it was such thoughts as these which made scozzone sad and thoughtful 

and caused her to feel remorse 



in the midst of her silent reverie  she started and raised her head  she

heard a light step on the stairway  and the next moment a key was

rapidly turned in the lock  and the door opened 



 how did you come in  who gave you that key  pagolo   she cried  rising

from her chair   there are only two keys to that door   one is in my

possession and the other in cellini s  



 ah  my dear catherine   laughed pagolo   you re a capricious creature 

sometimes you open your door to a fellow  and again you keep it closed 

and when one attempts to enter by force  even though you have given him

a right to do it  you threaten to call for help  so you see i had to

resort to stratagem  



 oh yes  tell me that you stole the key from cellini  without his

knowledge  tell me that he doesn t know you have it  for if he gave it

to you i should die of shame and chagrin  



 set your mind at rest  my lovely catherine   said pagolo  locking the

door  and sitting down near the girl  whom he forced to a seat beside

him   no  benvenuto doesn t love you  it is true  but he s like those

misers who have a treasure of which they make no use themselves  but

which they won t allow anybody else to touch  no  i made the key myself 

he who can do great things can do small things  tell me if i love you 

catherine  when my hands  which are accustomed to making pearls and

diamonds bloom on golden stalks  consented to shape an ignoble piece of

iron  it is true  wicked one  that the ignoble piece of iron was a key 

and that the key unlocked the door of paradise  



with that  pagolo would have taken catherine s hand  but  to the vast

amazement of cellini  who did not lose a word or a gesture of this

scene  catherine repulsed him 



 well  well   said pagolo   is this whim likely to last long  pray  



 look you  pagolo   said catherine  in a melancholy tone  which went to

cellini s heart   i know that when a woman has once yielded she has no

right to draw back afterward  but if the man for whom she has been so

weak has a generous heart   when she says to him that she was acting in

good faith at the time  because she had lost her reason  but that she

was mistaken   it is that man s duty  believe me  not to take an unfair

advantage of her momentary error  well  pagolo  i tell you this  i

yielded to you  and yet i did not love you  i loved another  and that

other cellini  despise me you may   indeed you ought   but torment me no

more  pagolo  



 good   exclaimed pagolo   good  you arrange the matter marvellously

well  upon my word  after the time you compelled me to wait for the

favor with which you now reproach me  you think that i will release you

from a definite engagement which you entered into of your own free will 

no  no  and when i think that you are doing all this for benvenuto  for

a man who is twice your age or mine  for a man who doesn t love you 

for a man who despises you  for a man who treats you as a courtesan  



 stop  pagolo  stop   cried scozzone  blushing with shame and jealousy

and rage   benvenuto doesn t love me any more  that is true  but he did

love me once  and he esteems me still  



 very good  why doesn t he marry you  as he promised to do  



 promised  never  no  benvenuto never promised to make me his wife  for

if he had promised  he would have done it  i aspired to mount so high as

that  the aspiration led me to hope that it might be so  and when the

hope had once taken shape in my heart  i could not confine it there  it

overflowed  and i boasted of a mere hope as if it were a reality  no 

pagolo  no   continued catherine  letting her hand fall into the

apprentice s with a sad smile    no  benvenuto never promised me aught  



 then  see how ungrateful you are  scozzone   cried pagolo  seizing her

hand  and mistaking what was simply a mark of dejection for a return to

him   you repulse me  who have promised you and offered you all that

benvenuto  by your own admission  never promised or offered you  while i

am convinced that if he were standing there  he who betrayed you  you

would freely make to him the confession you so bitterly regret having

made to me  who love you so dearly  



 oh if he were here   cried scozzone   if he were here  pagolo  you

would remember that you betrayed him through hatred  while i betrayed

him because i loved him  and you would sink into the ground  



 why so   demanded pagolo  bold as a lion because he believed benvenuto

to be far away   why so  if you please  hasn t every man the right to

win a woman s love when that woman doesn t belong to another  if he were

here  i would say to him   you abandoned catherine   poor catherine  who

loved you so well  she was in despair at first  until she fell in with a

kind hearted  worthy fellow  who appreciated her at her true worth  who

loved her  and who promised her what you would never promise her   to

make her his wife  he has inherited your rights  and that woman belongs

to him   tell me  catherine  what reply your cellini could make to

that  



 none at all   said a stern  manly voice behind the enthusiastic

pagolo    absolutely none at all  



at the same instant a powerful hand fell upon his shoulder  nipped his

eloquence in the bud  and threw him to the floor  as pale and terrified

as he had been boastful and rash a moment before 



it was a strange picture  pagolo on his knees  bent double  with

colorless cheeks  and deadly terror depicted on his features  scozzone 

half risen from her chair  motionless and dumfounded  like a statue of

astonishment  and lastly  benvenuto standing with folded arms  a sword

in its sheath in one hand  a naked sword in the other  with an

expression in which irony and menace struggled for the mastery 



there was a moment of awful silence  pagolo and scozzone being equally

abashed beneath the master s frown 



 treachery   muttered pagolo   treachery  



 yes  treachery on your part  wretch   retorted cellini 



 you asked to see him  pagolo   said scozzone   here he is  



 yes  here he is   said the apprentice  ashamed to be thus treated

before the woman he was so anxious to please   but he is armed  and i

have no weapon  



 i have brought you one   said cellini  stepping back  and throwing down

the sword he held in his left hand at pagolo s feet 



pagolo looked at the sword  but made no movement 



 come   said cellini   pick up the sword and stand up yourself  i am

waiting  



 a duel   muttered the apprentice  whose teeth were chattering with

terror   am i able to fight a duel on equal terms with you  



 very well   said cellini  passing his weapon from one hand to the

other   i will fight with my left hand  and that will make us equal  



 i fight with you  my benefactor   you  to whom i owe everything  never 

never  



a smile of profound contempt overspread benvenuto s face  while scozzone

recoiled without seeking to conceal the disgust which showed itself in

her expression 



 you should have remembered my benefactions before stealing from me the

woman i intrusted to your honor and ascanio s   said benvenuto   your

memory has come back to you too late  on guard  pagolo  on guard  



 no  no   murmured the coward  falling back upon his knees 



 as you refuse to fight like an honest man   said benvenuto   i propose

to punish you as a scoundrel  



he replaced his sword in its sheath  drew his dagger  and walked slowly

toward the apprentice without the slightest indication either of anger

or compassion upon his impassive features 



scozzone rushed between them with a shriek  but benvenuto  without

violence  with a motion of his arm as irresistible as that of a bronze

statue endowed with life  put her aside  and the poor girl fell back

half dead upon her chair  benvenuto walked on toward pagolo  who receded

as far as the wall  there the master overtook him  and said  putting his

dagger to his throat   



 commend your soul to god  you have five minutes to live  



 mercy   cried pagolo in an inarticulate voice   do not kill me  mercy 

mercy  



 what   said cellini   you know me  and  knowing me  seduced the woman

who belonged to me  i know all  i have discovered everything  and you

hope that i will spare you  you are laughing at me  pagolo  you are

laughing at me  



benvenuto himself laughed aloud as he spoke  but it was a strident 

terrible laugh  which made the apprentice shudder to his marrow 



 master  master   cried pagolo  as he felt the point of the dagger

pricking his throat   it was she  not i  yes  she led me into it  



 treachery  cowardice  and slander  i will make a group of those three

monsters some day   said benvenuto   and it will be a hideous thing to

see  she led you into it  you reptile  do you forget that i was here and

heard all that you said  



 o benvenuto   murmured catherine   you know that he lies when he says

that  do you not  



 yes  yes   said benvenuto   i know that he lies when he says that  as

he lied when he said that he was ready to marry you  but never fear  he

shall be punished for the double lie  



 yes  punish me   cried pagolo   but be merciful  punish me  but do not

kill me  



 you lied when you said that she led you into it  



 yes  i lied  yes  i am the guilty one  i loved her madly  and you know 

master  what love will lead a man to do  



 you lied when you said that you were ready to marry her  



 no  no  master  then i didn t lie  



 so you really love scozzone  



 oh  yes  indeed i love her   replied pagolo  realizing that the only

way of lessening his guilt in cellini s eyes was to attribute his crime

to the violence of his passion   yes  i love her  



 and you say again that you were not lying when you proposed to marry

her  



 i was not lying  master  



 you would have made her your wife  



 if she had not belonged to you  yes  



 very well  then  take her  i give her to you  



 what do you say  you are joking  are you not  



 no  i never spoke more seriously  look at me if you doubt it  



pagolo glanced furtively at cellini  and saw plainly in his face that

the judge might at any moment give place to the executioner  he bowed

his head  therefore  with a groan 



 take that ring from your finger  pagolo  and put it on catherine s  



pagolo passively obeyed the first portion of the order  and benvenuto

motioned to scozzone to draw near  she obeyed 



 put out your hand  scozzone   continued benvenuto 



again she obeyed 



 now do the rest  



pagolo placed the ring upon scozzone s finger 



 now   said benvenuto   that the betrothal is duly accomplished  we will

pass to the marriage  



 marriage   muttered pagolo   we can t be married in this way  we must

have notaries and a priest  



 we must have a contract   rejoined benvenuto  producing the one

prepared under his orders   here is one all ready  in which the names

only need to be inserted  



he placed the contract upon a table  took up a pen and handed it to

pagolo 



 sign  pagolo   said he   sign  



 ah  i have fallen into a trap   muttered the apprentice 



 eh  what s that   exclaimed benvenuto  without raising his voice  but

imparting to it an ominous accent   a trap  where is the trap in this 

did i urge you to come to scozzone s room  did i advise you to tell her

that you wished to make her your wife  very good  make her your wife 

pagolo  and when you are her husband our  rôles  will be changed  if i

come to her room  it will be your turn to threaten  and mine to be

afraid  



 oh  that would be too absurd   cried catherine  passing from extreme

terror to hysterical gayety  and laughing aloud at the idea which the

master s words evoked 



somewhat reassured by the turn cellini s threats had taken  and by

catherine s peals of laughter  pagolo began to look at matters a little

more reasonably  it became plain to him that cellini wished to frighten

him into a marriage for which he felt but little inclination  he

considered  therefore  that would be rather too tragic a

termination of the comedy  and that he might perhaps  with a little

resolution  make a better bargain 



 yes   he muttered  translating scozzone s gayety into words   yes  it

would be very amusing  i agree  but unfortunately it cannot be  



 what  it cannot be   cried benvenuto  as amazed as a lion might be to

find a fox demurring to his will 



 no  it cannot be   pagolo repeated   i prefer to die  kill me  



the words were hardly out of his mouth when cellini was upon him  pagolo

saw the dagger gleaming in the air  and threw himself to one side  so

swiftly and successfully that the blow which was intended for him simply

grazed his shoulder  and the blade  impelled by the goldsmith s powerful

hand  penetrated the wainscoting to the depth of several inches 



 i consent   cried pagolo   mercy  cellini  i consent  i am ready to do

anything   and while the master was withdrawing the dagger  which had

come in contact with the wall behind the wainscoting  he ran to the

table where the contract lay  seized the pen  and wrote his name  the

whole affair had taken place so rapidly that scozzone had no time to

take part in it 



 thanks  pagolo   said she  wiping away the tears which terror had

brought to her eyes  and at the same time repressing an inclination to

smile   thanks  dear pagolo  for the honor you consent to confer upon

me  but it s better that we should understand each other thoroughly now 

so listen to me  just now you would have none of me  and now i will have

none of you  i don t say this to mortify you  pagolo  but i do not love

you  and i desire to remain as i am  



 in that case   said benvenuto  with the utmost coolness   if you won t

have him  scozzone  he must die  



 why   cried catherine   it is i who refuse him  



 he must die   rejoined benvenuto   it shall not be said that a man

insulted me  and went unpunished  are you ready  pagolo  



 catherine   cried the apprentice   catherine  in heaven s name take

pity on me  catherine  i love you  catherine  i will love you always 

sign  catherine  catherine be my wife  i beg you on my knees  



 come  scozzone  decide quickly   said cellini 



 oh   said catherine  pouting   tell me  master  don t you think you are

rather hard on me  who have loved you so dearly  and who have dreamed of

something so different  but   cried the fickle child  passing suddenly

from melancholy to merriment once more   mon dieu  cellini  see what a

piteous face poor pagolo is making  oh  for heaven s sake  put aside

that lugubrious expression  pagolo  or i will never consent to take you

for my husband  really  you are too absurd  



 save me first  catherine   said pagolo   then we will laugh  if you

choose  



 oh well  my poor boy  if you really and truly wish it   



 yes  indeed i do  



 you know what i have been  you know what i am  



 yes  i know  



 you are not deceived in me  



 no  



 you will not regret it  



 no  no  



 then give me your hand  it s very ridiculous  and i hardly expected it 

but  no matter  i am your wife  



she took the pen and signed  as a dutiful wife should do  below her

husband s signature 



 thanks  catherine  thanks   cried pagolo   you will see how happy i

will make you  



 if he is false to that promise   said benvenuto   write to me 

scozzone  and wherever i may be i will come in person to remind him of

it  



as he spoke  cellini slowly pushed his dagger back into its sheath 

keeping his eyes fixed upon the apprentice  then he took the contract 

folded it neatly  and put it in his pocket  and said to pagolo  with the

withering sarcasm which was characteristic of him   



 now  friend pagolo  although you and scozzone are duly married

according to the laws of men  you are not in god s sight  and the church

will not sanctify your union until to morrow  until then your presence

here would be in contravention of all laws  divine and human  good

night  pagolo  



pagolo turned pale as death  but as benvenuto pointed imperatively to

the door  he backed out of the room 



 no one but you  cellini  would ever have had such an idea as that  

said catherine  laughing as if she would die   hark ye  my poor pagolo  

she said  as he opened the door   i let you go because the law requires

it  but never fear  pagolo  i swear by the blessed virgin  that when you

are my husband no man  not even benvenuto himself  will find me anything

but a virtuous wife 



 o cellini   she added  gayly  when the door was closed   you give me a

husband  but relieve me of his presence for to day  it is so much time

gained  you owed me this reparation  









xxi





resumption of hostilities





three days after the scene we have described  a scene of quite another

sort was in preparation at the louvre 



monday  the day appointed for signing the contract  had arrived  it was

eleven o clock in the morning when benvenuto left the hôtel de nesle 

went straight to the louvre  and with anxious heart but firm step

ascended the grand staircase 



in the reception room  into which he was first ushered  he found the

provost and d orbec  who were conferring with a notary in the corner 

colombe  pale and motionless as a statue  was seated on the other side

of the room  staring into vacancy  they had evidently moved away from

her so that she could not hear  and the poor child had remained where

they placed her 



cellini passed in front of her  and let these words fall upon her bowed

head   



 have courage  i am here  



colombe recognized his voice  and raised her head with a cry of joy  but

before she had time to question her protector  he had already entered

the adjoining room 



an usher drew aside a tapestry portière  and the goldsmith passed into

the king s cabinet 



nothing less than these words of cheer would have availed to revive

colombo s courage  the poor child believed that she was abandoned  and

consequently lost  messire d estourville had dragged her thither  half

dead  despite her faith in god and in benvenuto  as they were setting

out  she was conscious of such a feeling of despair at her heart  that

she implored madame d etampes to allow her to enter a convent  promising

to renounce ascanio provided that she might be spared comte d orbec  but

the duchess wanted no half victory  in order that her purpose might be

attained  it was essential that ascanio should believe in the treachery

of his beloved  and so she sternly refused to listen to poor colombe s

prayers  thereupon  colombe summoned all her courage  remembering that

benvenuto bade her be strong and brave  even at the altar s foot  and

with occasional sinkings of the heart allowed herself to be taken to the

louvre  where the king was to sign the contract at noon 



there again her strength failed her for a moment  for but three chances

now remained  to touch the king s heart with her prayers  to see

benvenuto arrive  or to die of grief 



benvenuto had come  benvenuto had told her to hope  and colombe s

courage revived once more 



on entering the king s cabinet  cellini found madame d etampes alone  it

was all that he desired  he would have solicited the honor of seeing her

had she not been there 



the duchess was thoughtful in her hour of triumph  and yet  with the

fatal letter burned  burned by herself  she was fully convinced that she

had nothing to fear  but although she was reassured as to her power  she

contemplated with dismay the perils that threatened her love  it was

always thus with the duchess  when the anxiety attendant upon her

ambition was at rest  the ardent passions of her heart devoured her  her

dream  in which pride and passion were mingled  was to make ascanio

great while making him happy  but she knew now that ascanio  although of

noble origin   for the gaddis  to which family he belonged  were

patricians of long standing at florence   aspired to no other glory than

that of being a great artist 



if his hopes were ever fixed upon anything  it was some beautifully

shaped vase  or ewer  or statue  if he ever longed for diamonds or

pearls  it was so that he might make of them  by setting them in chased

gold  lovelier flowers than those which heaven waters with its dew 

titles and honors were nothing to him if they did not flow from his own

talent  and were not the guerdon of his personal renown  what part could

such a useless dreamer play in the active  agitated life of the duchess 

in the first storm the delicate plant would be destroyed  with the

flowers which it already bore and the fruit of which it gave promise  it

might be that he would allow himself to be drawn into the schemes of his

royal mistress through discouragement or through indifference  but in

that case  a pale and melancholy shadow  he would live only in his

memories of the past  ascanio  in fine  appeared to the duchesse

d etampes  as he really was  an exquisite  fascinating personality  so

long as he remained in a pure  untroubled atmosphere  he was an adorable

child  who would never become a man  he could devote himself to

sentiments  but never to ideas  born to enjoy the outpourings of a

mutual affection  he would inevitably go down in the first terrific

onset of the struggle for supremacy and power  he was the man needed to

satisfy madame d etampes s passion  but not to keep pace with her in her

ambitious schemes 



such was the tenor of her reflections when benvenuto entered  the clouds

of her thought hovering about her darkened her brow 



the two adversaries eyed each other narrowly  the same satirical smile

appeared upon their lips at the same time  the glances they exchanged

were twin brothers  and indicated that they were equally prepared for

the struggle  and that  the struggle would be a desperate one 



 well and good  he is a rough fighter   thought anne   whom it will be a

pleasure to overcome  a foeman worthy of my steel  but to day there are 

in truth  too many chances against him  and there will be no great glory

in overthrowing him  



 beyond question  madame d etampes   said benvenuto to himself   you are

a masterful woman  and more than one contest with a strong man has given

me less trouble than this i have entered upon with you  you may be sure 

therefore  that  while fighting courteously  i shall none the less fight

with all the weapons at my disposal  



there was a moment s silence while the combatants delivered themselves

of these brief monologues aside  the duchess was the first to break the

silence 



 you are punctual  master cellini   said she   his majesty is to sign

comte d orbec s contract at noon  and it is now only a quarter past

eleven  permit me to make his majesty s excuses  he is not behindhand 

but you are beforehand  



 i am very happy  madame  that i arrived too early  as my impatience

procures me the honor of a  tête à tête  with you   an honor i should

have requested most urgently  had not chance  to which i return my

thanks  anticipated my wishes  



 good lack  benvenuto   said the duchess   does defeat incline you to

flattery  



 not my own defeat  madame  but that of other persons  i have always

considered it peculiarly meritorious to pay my court to one in disgrace 

and here is the proof of it  madame  



as he spoke  benvenuto drew from beneath his cloak ascanio s golden

lily  which he had completed that morning  the duchess exclaimed with

wonder and delight  never had her eyes beheld such a marvellous jewel 

never did one of the flowers found in the enchanted gardens of the

 thousand and one nights  so dazzle the eyes of peri or fairy 



 ah   cried the duchess  putting forth her hand to take the flower   you

promised me  benvenuto  but i confess that i did not rely upon your

promise  



 why should you not rely upon it  madame   laughed benvenuto   you

insult me  



 oh  if you had promised to perform a revengeful  instead of a gallant

act  i should have been much more certain that you would redeem your

promise punctually  



 who told you that i did not promise both   retorted benvenuto  drawing

back his hand  so that the lily was still in his control 



 i do not understand you   said the duchess 



 do you not think   said benvenuto  pointing to the diamond shimmering

in the heart of the flower  the diamond which she owed to the corrupting

munificence of charles v    that when mounted in the guise of a dewdrop 

the earnest given to bind a certain bargain which is to set off the

duchy of milan from france has a fine effect  



 you speak in enigmas  my dear goldsmith  unfortunately the king will

soon be here  and i haven t time to guess them  



 i will tell you the answer  then  it is an old proverb   verba  volant 

scripta manent   which  being interpreted  means   what is written is

written   



 ah  that s where you are in error  my dear goldsmith  what is written

is burned  so do not think to frighten me as you would a child  and give

me the lily which belongs to me  



 one instant  madame  i ought to warn you that while it is a magic

talisman in my hands  it will lose all its virtue in yours  my work is

even more valuable than you think  where the multitude sees only a

jewel  we artists sometimes conceal an idea  do you wish me to show you

this idea  madame  nothing is easier  look  all that is necessary is to

press this invisible spring  the stalk opens  as you see  and in the

heart of the flower we find  not a gnawing worm  as in some natural

flowers and some false hearts  but something similar  worse it may

be   the dishonor of the duchesse d etampes  written with her own hand

and signed by her  



as he spoke  benvenuto pressed the spring  opened the stalk  and took

out the letter  he slowly unfolded it  and showed it  open  to the

duchess  pale with wrath  and stricken dumb with dismay 



 you hardly expected this  did you  madame   said benvenuto  coolly 

folding the letter once more  and replacing it in the lily   if you knew

my ways  madame  you would be less surprised  a year ago i concealed a

ladder in a statuette  a month ago i concealed a maiden in a statue 

what was there that i could hide away in a flower to day  a bit of

paper  that was all  and that is what i have done  



 but that letter   cried the duchess   that infernal letter i burned

with my own hands  i saw the flame and touched the ashes  



 did you read the letter you burned  



 no  no  madwoman that i was  i did not read it  



 that is too bad  for you would be convinced now that the letter of a

grisette will make as much flame and ashes as the letter of a duchess  



 why  then  ascanio  the dastard  deceived me  



 oh madame  pray pause  do not suspect that pure and innocent child 

who  even if he had deceived you  would have done no more than turn

against you the weapons you used against him  oh no  no  he did not

deceive you  he would not purchase his own life or colombe s by deceit 

no  he was himself deceived  



 by whom  pray tell me that  



 by a mere boy  a student  the same who wounded your trusty retainer 

vicomte de marmagne  by one jacques aubry  in short  whom it is likely

that the vicomte de marmagne has mentioned to you  



 yes   murmured the duchess   yes  marmagne did tell me that this

student  this jacques aubry  was seeking to gain access to ascanio in

order to secure that letter  



 and it was after that you paid ascanio a visit  but students are

active  you know  and ours had already anticipated you  as you left the

hôtel d etampes  he was creeping into his friend s cell  and as you

entered it  he went out  



 but i didn t see him  i saw nobody  



 one doesn t think to look everywhere  if you had done so  you would  in

due course  have raised a certain mat  and under that mat would have

found a hole communicating with the adjoining cell  



 but ascanio  ascanio  



 when you entered he was asleep  was he not  



 yes  



 very good  during his sleep  aubry  to whom he had refused to give the

letter  took it from his coat pocket  and put a letter of his own in its

place  you were misled by the envelope  and thought that you were

burning a note from madame la duchesse d etampes  not so  madame  you

burned an epistle penned by mademoiselle gervaise perrette popinot  



 but this aubry  who wounded marmagne  this clown  who almost murdered a

nobleman  will pay dear for his insolence  he is in prison and condemned

to death  



 he is free  madame  and owes his freedom in great measure to you  



 how so  



 why  who but he was the poor prisoner whose pardon you joined me in

urging upon king françois  



 oh insane fool that i was   muttered the duchess  biting her lips till

the blood ran  she looked benvenuto squarely in the eye for a moment 

then continued  in a panting voice   



 on what condition will you give me that letter  



 i think i have allowed you to guess  madame  



 i am not skilled in guessing  tell me  



 you must ask the king to bestow colombe s hand upon ascanio  



 go to   rejoined anne with a forced laugh   you little know the

duchesse d etampes  master goldsmith  if you fancy that my love will

yield to threats  



 you did not reflect before answering me  madame  



 i stand by my answer  however  



 kindly permit me to sit down unceremoniously  madame  and to talk

plainly with you a moment   said benvenuto  with the dignified

familiarity peculiar to superior men   i am only an humble sculptor  and

you are a great duchess  but let me tell you that  notwithstanding the

distance which separates us  we were made to understand each other  do

not assume those queenly airs  they will have no effect  it is not my

purpose to insult you  but to enlighten you  and your haughty manner is

out of place because your pride is not at stake  



 you are a strange man  upon my word   said anne  laughing in spite of

herself   say on  i am listening  



 i was saying  madame la duchesse   continued benvenuto  coolly   that 

despite the difference in our fortunes  our positions are almost the

same  and that we could understand each other  and perhaps mutually

assist each other  you cried out when i suggested that you should

renounce ascanio  it seemed to you impossible and mad  and yet i had set

you an example  madame  



 an example  



 yes  as you love ascanio  i loved colombe  



 you  



 i  i loved her as i had never loved but once  i would have given my

blood  my life  my soul for her  and yet i gave her to ascanio  



 truly a most unselfish passion   sneered the duchess 



 oh  do not make my suffering matter for raillery  madame  do not mock

at my agony  i have suffered keenly  but i realized that the child was

no more made for me than ascanio for you  listen  madame  we are both 

if i may be pardoned for the comparison  of those exceptional and

uncommon natures which lead an existence of their own  have feelings and

emotions peculiar to themselves  and rarely find themselves in accord

with others  we both obey  madame  a sovereign idol  the worship of

which has expanded our hearts and placed us higher than mankind  to you 

madame  ambition is all in all  to me  art  now our divinities are

jealous  and exert their sway always and everywhere  you desired ascanio

as a crown  i desired colombe as a galatea  you loved as a duchess  i as

an artist  you have persecuted  i have suffered  oh  do not think that

i wrong you in my thoughts  i admire your energy  and sympathize with

your audacity  let the vulgar think what they will  from your point of

view it is a great thing to turn the world upside down in order to make

a place for the person one loves  i recognize therein a strong and

masterful passion  and i admire characters capable of such heroic

crimes  but i also admire superhuman characters  for everything which

eludes foresight  everything outside the beaten paths  has an attraction

for me  even while i loved colombe  madame  i considered that my

domineering  unruly nature would be ill mated with that pure angelic

soul  colombe loved ascanio  my harmless  sweet natured pupil  my rough 

vigorous temperament would have frightened her  thereupon  in a loud 

imperative tone  i bade my love hold its peace  and as it remonstrated i

called to my assistance my art divine  and by our united efforts we

floored the rebellious passion and held it down  then sculpture  my

true  my only mistress  touched my brow with her burning lips  and i was

comforted  do as i have done  madame la duchesse  leave these children

to their angel loves and do not disturb them in their heaven  our domain

is earth  with its sorrows  its conflicts  and its intoxicating

triumphs  seek a refuge against suffering in ambition  unmake empires to

distract your thoughts  play with the kings and masters of the world to

amuse yourself  that would be well done  and i would applaud your

efforts  but do not wreck the peace and happiness of these poor

innocents  who love each other with such a pure  sweet love  before the

face of god and the virgin mary  



 who are you  master benvenuto cellini  i do not know you   said the

duchess in blank amazement   who are you  



 vrai dieu  a man among men  as you are a woman among women   rejoined

the goldsmith  laughing with his customary frankness   and if you do not

know me  you see that i have a great advantage over you  for i do know

you  madame  



 it may be so   said the duchess   but it is my opinion that a woman

among women loves better and more earnestly than a man among men  for

she snaps her fingers at your superhuman abnegation  and defends her

lover with beak and claws to the last gasp  



 you persist  then  in refusing to give ascanio to colombe  



 i persist in loving him myself  



 so be it  but if you will not yield with good grace  beware  i am

somewhat rough when i am roused  and may make you cry out a little in

the  mêlée   you have reflected fully  have you not  you refuse once

for all your consent to the union of ascanio and colombe  



 most emphatically  yes  



 very good  to our posts   cried benvenuto   for the battle is on  



at that moment the door opened and an usher announced the king 









xxii





a love match





françois appeared on the threshold  giving his hand to diane de

poitiers  with whom he had come from the bedside of his sick son  diane 

inspired by her hatred  had a vague feeling that her rival was

threatened with humiliation  and did not choose to miss the gratifying

spectacle 



as for the king  he saw nothing  suspected nothing  he believed madame

d etampes and benvenuto to be entirely reconciled  and as he saw them

talking together when he entered  he saluted them both at once  with the

same smile  and the same inclination of the head 



 good morrow  my queen of beauty  good morrow  my king of artists   he

said   what are you talking about so confidentially  you seem both to be

deeply interested  



 mon dieu  sire  we are talking politics   said benvenuto 



 and what particular subject exercises your faculties  tell me  i beg  



 the question which engrosses everybody at present  sire   continued the

goldsmith 



 ah  the duchy of milan  



 yes  sire  



 well  what were you saying of it  



 we do not agree  sire  one of us maintains that the emperor might well

refuse to give you the duchy of milan  and yet redeem his promise by

giving it to your son charles  



 which of you makes that suggestion  



 i think that it was madame d etampes  sire  



the duchess became pale as death 



 if the emperor should do that  it would be infamous treachery   said

françois   but he ll not do it  



 in any event  even if he does not do it   said diane  joining in the

conversation   it will not be  i am assured  for lack of advice given

him to that effect  



 given by whom   cried the king   by mahomet s belly  i would be glad to

know by whom  



 bon dieu  do not be so disturbed  sire   rejoined benvenuto   we said

that as we said other things   simple conjectures  put forward by us in

desultory talk  madame la duchesse and i are but bungling politicians 

sire  madame la duchesse is too much of a woman to think of aught beside

her toilet  although she has no need to think of that  and i  sire  am

too much of an artist to think of aught beside art  is it not so  madame

la duchesse  



 the truth is  my dear cellini   said françois   that each of you has

too glorious a part to play to envy others aught that they may have 

even though it were the duchy of milan  madame la duchesse d etampes is

queen by virtue of her beauty  and you are king by virtue of your

talent  



 king  sire  



 yes  king  and although you haven t  as i have  three lilies in your

crest  you have one in your hand  which seems to me to be lovelier than

any that ever blossomed in the brightest sunlight or upon the fairest

field in all heraldry  



 this lily is not mine  sire  it belongs to madame d etampes  who

commissioned my pupil ascanio to make it  but as he could not finish it 

and as i realized madame d etampes s desire to have so rich a jewel in

her possession  i set to work myself and finished it  wishing with all

my heart to make it the symbol of the treaty of peace which we ratified

the other day in your majesty s presence  



 it is marvellously beautiful   said the king  putting out his hand to

take it 



 is it not  sire   rejoined benvenuto  withdrawing it as if without

design   and the young artist  whose  chef d œuvre  it is  certainly

deserves to be magnificently rewarded  



 such is my purpose   interposed the duchess   i have in store for him a

recompense which a king might envy him  



 but you know  madame  that the recompense to which you refer  splendid

as it is  is not that upon which his heart is fixed  what would you

have  madame  we artists are whimsical creatures  and often the thing

which would  as you say  arouse a king s envy  is viewed by us with

disdainful eye  



 nevertheless   said madame d etampes  as an angry flush overspread her

face   he must be content with what i have set apart for him  for i have

already told you  benvenuto  that i would accord him no other save at

the last extremity  



 very well  you may confide to me what his wishes are   said françois

to benvenuto  once more putting out his hand for the lily   and if it s

not too difficult a matter  we will try to arrange it  



 observe the jewel carefully  sire   said benvenuto  placing the stalk

of the flower in the king s hand   examine it in detail  and your

majesty will see that any compensation whatsoever must fall short of the

value of such a masterpiece  



as he spoke  benvenuto darted a keen glance at the duchess  but her

self control was so perfect  that not a muscle of her face moved as she

saw the lily pass from the artist s hand to the king s 



  t is really miraculous   said the king   but where did you find this

superb diamond which glistens in the heart of the flower  



 i did not find it  sire   replied cellini  with charming affability 

 madame d etampes furnished it to my pupil  



 i was not aware that you owned this diamond  madame  whence came it to

your hands  pray  



 why  probably from the place where most diamonds come from  sire  from

the mines of guzarate or golconda  



 there is a long story connected with that diamond  sire  and if your

majesty cares to hear it  i will tell it you  the diamond and i are old

acquaintances  for this is the third time it has passed through my

hands  in the first place  i set it in the tiara of our holy father  the

pope  where its effect was marvellous  then  by order of clement vii   i

mounted it upon a missal which his holiness presented to the emperor

charles v   and as the emperor desired to carry it constantly about him 

as a resource doubtless in an emergency  i set the diamond  which is

worth more than a million  in a ring  sire  hid not your majesty observe

it on the hand of your cousin  the emperor  



 yes  i remember   cried the king   yes  on the day of our first

interview he had it on his finger  how comes the diamond in your

possession  duchess  



 yes  tell us   cried diane  whose eyes shone with joy   how came it

about that a diamond of that value passed from the emperor s hands to

yours  



 if the question were put to you  madame   retorted madame d etampes 

 the answer would not be far to seek  assuming that you confess certain

matters to any other than your confessor  



 you do not answer the king s question  madame   rejoined diane 



 yes   said françois   how comes the diamond in your possession  



 ask benvenuto   said madame d etampes  hurling a last defiance at her

enemy   benvenuto will tell you  



 tell me  then   said the king   and instantly  i am weary of waiting  



 very good  sire   said benvenuto   i must confess to your majesty that

at sight of this diamond strange suspicions awoke in my mind  as in

yours  it was while madame d etampes and myself were at enmity  you must

know  and i should not have been sorry to learn some little secret which

might injure her in your majesty s eyes  so i followed the scent  and i

learned   



 you learned  



benvenuto glanced hastily at the duchess  and saw that she was smiling 

the power of resistance which she manifested pleased him  and  instead

of putting an end to the struggle brutally with one stroke  he resolved

to prolong it  like au athlete  sure of victory in the end  who  having

fallen in with an antagonist worthy of him  resolves to display all his

strength and all his skill 



 you learned    the king repeated 



 i learned that she purchased it of manasseh  the jew  yes  sire  know

this and govern yourself accordingly  it seems that since he entered

france your cousin  the emperor  has scattered so much money along the

road  that he is reduced to putting his diamonds in pawn  and madame

d etampes  with royal magnificence  gathers in what the imperial poverty

cannot retain  



 ah  by my honor as a gentleman   t is most diverting   cried françois 

doubly flattered in his vanity as lover  and in his jealousy as king 

 but  fair lady   he added  addressing the duchess   methinks you must

have ruined yourself in order to make such an acquisition  and it is for

us to repair the disordered state of your finances  remember that we are

your debtor to the value of the diamond  for it is so magnificent that i

am determined that it shall come to you from a king s hand at least  if

not from an emperor s  



 thanks  benvenuto   said the duchess in an undertone   i begin to

believe  as you claim  that we were made to understand each other  



 what are you saying   cried the king 



 oh  nothing  sire  i was apologizing to the duchess for my first

suspicion  which she deigns to pardon   a favor which is the more

generous on her part  in that the lily gave birth to another suspicion  



 what was that   demanded the king  while diane  whose hate was too keen

to allow her to be deceived by this comedy  devoured her triumphant

rival with her eyes 



madame d etampes saw that she was not yet quit of her indefatigable foe 

and a shadow of dread passed across her face  but it should be said  in

justice to her courage  only to disappear immediately 



furthermore  she availed herself of the king s preoccupation  caused by

benvenuto s words  to try to gain possession of the lily  but benvenuto

carelessly placed himself between the king and her 



 what was the suspicion  oh   the goldsmith said with a smile   it was

so infamous that i am not sure that i shouldn t be ashamed of having

had it  and that it would not add to my offence to be so shameless as to

avow it  i must have an express command from your majesty before i

should dare   



 dare  cellini  i command you   said the king 



 so be it  in the first place   said cellini   i confess with an

artist s candid pride  that i was surprised to see madame d etampes

intrust the apprentice with a task which the master would have been

happy and proud to execute for her  you remember my apprentice  ascanio 

sire  he is a charming youth  who might venture to pose for endymion 

upon my word  



 well  what then   said the king  his brows contracting at the suspicion

which began to gnaw his heart 



this time it was evident that  for all her self control  madame

d etampes was on the rack  in the first place she read malicious

curiosity in the eyes of diane de poitiers  and in the second place she

was well aware that  while françois might have forgiven treason to the

king  he certainly would not forgive infidelity to the lover  however 

as if he did not notice her agony  benvenuto continued   



 i reflected upon the beauty of my ascanio  and it occurred to

me  forgive me  mesdames  if there was anything in the thought which

seems to cast a reflection upon the french  but i am accustomed to the

ways of our italian princesses  who  in love  it must be confessed  are

very weak creatures  it occurred to me that a sentiment which had little

connection with art   



 master   said françois  frowning darkly   reflect before you speak  



 i apologized beforehand for my temerity  and asked to be permitted to

hold my peace  



 i bear witness to that   said diane   you yourself bade him speak 

sire  and now that he has begun   



 it is always time to stop   said madame d etampes   when one knows that

what one is about to say is a falsehood  



 i will stop if you choose  madame   said benvenuto   you know that you

have but to say the word  



 yes  but i choose that he shall continue  you are right  diane  there

are matters here which must be probed to the bottom  say on  monsieur 

say on   said the king  keeping his eyes fixed upon the sculptor and the

duchess 



 my conjectures were taking a wide range when an incredible discovery

opened a new field to them  



 what was it   cried the king and diane de poitiers in the same breath 



 i am getting in very deep   whispered cellini to the duchess 



 sire   said she   you do not need to hold the lily in your hand to

listen to this long discourse  your majesty is so accustomed to hold a

sceptre in a firm grasp  that i fear the fragile flower may be broken in

your fingers  



as she spoke  the duchess  with one of those smiles which belonged to

her alone  put out her hand to take the jewel 



 forgive me  madame la duchesse   said cellini   but as the lily plays

an important part throughout my story  permit me to enforce my words

with ocular demonstration  



 the lily plays an important part in the story you have to tell 

master   cried diane  snatching the flower from the king s hand with a

movement swift as thought   in that case  madame d etampes is right  for

if the story is at all what i suspect  it is much better that the lily

should be in my hands than in yours  sire  for  purposely or not  your

majesty might  by some uncontrollable impulse  break it  



madame d etampes became terribly pale  for she deemed herself lost  she

hastily seized benvenuto s hand  and her lips opened to speak  but

almost immediately she thought better of it  her hand let the artist s

fall  and her lips closed again 



 say what you have to say   she muttered through her clenched

teeth    if you dare   she added in so low a tone that benvenuto alone

could hear 



 yes  and measure your words  my master   said the king 



 and do you  madame  measure your silence   said benvenuto 



 we are waiting   cried diane  unable to restrain her impatience 



 fancy  sire  and you  madame  fancy that ascanio and madame la duchesse

d etampes corresponded  



the duchess looked about to see if there were not at hand some weapon

with which she could silence the goldsmith s tongue forever 



 corresponded   echoed the king 



 yes  corresponded  and the most extraordinary thing is that the subject

of this correspondence between madame la duchesse d etampes and the

humble carver s apprentice was love  



 the proofs  master  you have proofs  i trust   cried the king  in a

rage 



 o mon dieu  yes  sire   replied benvenuto   your majesty must

understand that i should not have allowed myself to form such suspicions

without proofs  



 produce them instantly  then   said the king 



 when i say that i have them  i am in error  your majesty had them a

moment since  



 i   cried the king 



 and madame de poitiers has them now  



 i   cried diane 



 yes   rejoined benvenuto  who  amid the king s wrath  and the hatred

and terror of the two most powerful women in the world  was perfectly

cool and complacent   yes  for the proofs are in the lily  



 in the lily   cried the king  snatching the flower from the hands of

diane de poitiers  and examining it with a careful scrutiny  in which

love of art had no share   in this lily  



 yes  sire  in the lily   benvenuto repeated   you know that it is so 

madame   he continued in a meaning tone  toward the gasping duchess 



 let us come to terms   she whispered   colombe shall not marry

d orbec  



 that is not enough   returned cellini   ascanio must marry colombe  



 never   exclaimed madame d etampes 



meanwhile the king was turning the fatal lily over and over in his

fingers  his suspense and wrath being the more poignant in that he dared

not express them openly 



 the proofs are in the lily  in the lily   he repeated   but i can see

nothing in the lily  



 because your majesty does not know the secret of opening it  



 there is a secret  show it me  messire  on the instant  or rather   



françois made a movement as if to crush the flower  but both women

cried out  and he checked himself 



 oh sire  it would be a pity   cried diane   such a charming toy  give

it to me  sire  and i promise you that if there is a secret i will find

it  



her slender  active fingers  to which hatred lent additional subtlety 

passed over all the rough places on the jewel  felt in all the hollows 

while the duchesse d etampes  half fainting  followed with haggard eyes

her investigations  which for a moment were without result  but at last 

whether by good luck  or a rival s instinct of divination  diane touched

the precise spot on the stalk 



the flower opened 



the two women cried out again at the same moment  one with joy  the

other with dismay  the duchess darted forward to tear the lily from

diane s hand  but benvenuto held her back with one hand  while with the

other he showed her the letter which he had taken from its hiding place 

a swift glance at the flower showed her that the hiding place was empty 



 i agree to everything   said the duchess  completely crushed  and too

weak to maintain such a contest 



 on the gospel   said benvenuto 



 on the gospel  



 well  master   said the king  impatiently   where are the proofs  i see

a recess very cleverly hollowed out in the stalk  but there is nothing

within it  



 no  sire  there is nothing   said benvenuto 



 true  but there might have been something   suggested diane 



 madame is right   said benvenuto 



 master   cried the king through his clenched teeth  do you know that it

may be dangerous for you to prolong this pleasantry  and that stronger

men than you have repented playing with my anger  



 for that reason i should be in despair were i to incur it  sire  

rejoined cellini  without losing his composure   but there is nothing in

the present circumstances to arouse it  for i trust your majesty did not

take my words seriously  should i have dared to bring so grave an

accusation so lightly  madame d etampes can show you the letters this

lily contained  if you are curious to see them  they are in fact

concerned with love  but it is the love of my poor ascanio for a noble

demoiselle   a passion which at first seems insane and impossible 

doubtless  but my ascanio  like the true artist he is  fancying that a

beautiful jewel falls not far short of equalling in value a beautiful

maiden  applied to madame d etampes as to a special providence  and made

this lily his messenger  now  you know  sire  that providence can do

anything  and you will not be jealous of this particular one  i fancy 

since  while doing a kindly action  she attributes part of the credit to

you  that is the solution of the enigma  sire  and if all the beating

about the bush i have indulged in has offended your majesty  i pray you

to forgive me in consideration of the familiarity to which you have been

graciously pleased to admit me  



this quasi academic harangue changed the face of affairs  as benvenuto

went on  diane s brow grew dark  while the wrinkles vanished from that

of madame d etampes  and the king resumed his smiling good humor  when

benvenuto had finished   



 forgive me  fair duchess   said françois   for having dared to suspect

you for an instant  tell me what i can do to redeem my offence and earn

my forgiveness  



 grant the request which madame la duchesse d etampes is about to make 

as your majesty heretofore granted the one that i made  



 speak for me  master cellini  since you know what it is that i wish  

said the duchess with better grace than cellini would have thought

possible 



 very well  since madame la duchesse appoints me to be her mouthpiece 

sire  you must know that she desires your all powerful intervention in

favor of poor ascanio s passion  



 yes  yes   laughed the king   i agree with all my heart to assist in

making the comely apprentice a happy man  what is the name of his

sweetheart  



 colombe d estourville  sire  



 colombe d estourville   cried françois 



 i pray your majesty to remember that it is madame d etampes who

proffers this request  come  madame  add your prayers to mine   he

added  causing a corner of the letter to protrude from his pocket   for

if you are silent much longer  his majesty will think that you make the

request solely from a desire to oblige me  



 is it true that you desire this marriage  madame   inquired françois 



 yes  sire   murmured madame d etampes   i do desire it  earnestly  



the adverb was extracted by a fresh exhibition of the letter 



 but how do i know   said the king   that the provost will accept for

his son in law a nameless  penniless youth  



 in the first place  sire   benvenuto replied   the provost  being a

loyal subject  will surely have no other will than his king s  in the

second place  ascanio is not nameless  he is a gaddo gaddi  and one of

his ancestors was podesta of florence  he is a goldsmith  it is true 

but in italy it is no disgrace to belong to that guild  furthermore 

even if he could boast of no ancient nobility  as i am at liberty to

insert his name in the letters patent which have been forwarded to me by

your majesty s directions  he will be a nobleman of recent creation  oh 

think not that it requires any sacrifice on my part to resign in his

favor  to reward my ascanio is to reward myself twice over  so it is

settled  sire  that he is seigneur de nesle  and i will not let him want

for money  he may  if he will  lay aside his profession  and buy a

company of lances  or an appointment at court  i will provide the

funds  



 and we shall look to it  you may be sure  that your generosity does not

lighten your purse too much  



 then i may consider  sire   



 ascanio gaddo gaddi  seigneur de nesle  let it be   cried the king 

laughing heartily  the certainty that madame d etampes was faithful to

him had put him in a joyous humor 



 madame   said cellini  in an undertone   you cannot in conscience leave

the seigneur de nesle at the châtelet  it was well enough for ascanio  



madame d etampes called an officer of the guards  and whispered a few

words  the concluding ones being these   



 in the king s name  



 what are you doing  madame   demanded françois 



 madame d etampes is simply sending a messenger for the bridegroom that

is to be  sire   interposed cellini 



 where  



 where madame d etampes  who knew the king s kindness of heart  bade him

await your majesty s pleasure  



fifteen minutes later  the door of the apartment opened  in which were

assembled colombe  the provost  d orbec  the spanish ambassador  and

almost the whole court  except marmagne  who was still confined to his

bed  an usher cried   



 the king  



françois i  entered  leading diane de poitiers  and followed by

benvenuto  upon one of whose arms was leaning the duchesse d etampes 

and on the other ascanio  each of them being as pale as the other 



at the announcement made by the usher  all the courtiers turned  and all

were paralyzed for a moment when they saw this strange group 



their astonishment redoubled when the king  stepping aside to allow the

sculptor to pass in front of him  said in a loud voice   



 master benvenuto  take our place for the moment  and our authority 

speak as if you were the king  and be obeyed as a king should be  



 beware  sire   replied the goldsmith   in order to fill your place

fittingly  i propose to be magnificent  



 go on  benvenuto   said françois laughingly   every magnificent stroke

will be a bit of flattery for me  



 very good  sire  that puts me at my ease  and i will praise you as much

as i can  do not forget   he continued   all you who hear me  that the

king is speaking by my mouth  messieurs les notaires  you have prepared

the contract which his majesty deigns to sign  insert the names of the

contracting parties  



the two notaries seized their pens and made ready to write the names in

the two copies of the contract  one of which was to remain in the

archives and the other in their office 



 of the one part   continued cellini   the noble and puissant

demoiselle  colombe d estourville  



 colombe d estourville   repeated the notaries  mechanically  while the

auditors listened in open mouthed astonishment 



 of the other part   continued cellini   the most noble and puissant

ascanio gaddi  seigneur de nesle  



 ascanio gaddi   cried the provost and d orbec in the same breath 



 a mere artisan   added the provost bitterly  turning toward the king 



 ascanio gaddi  seigneur de nesle   repeated benvenuto  unmoved   upon

whom his majesty bestows letters of naturalization and the office of

superintendent of the royal châteaux  



 if his majesty so commands  i will obey   said the provost   but   



 ascanio gaddi   continued benvenuto   out of regard for whom his

majesty grants to messire robert d estourville  provost of paris  the

title of chamberlain  



 sire  i am ready to sign   said d estourville  vanquished at last 



 mon dieu  mon dieu   murmured colombe  falling back into her chair   is

not all this a dream  



 and what of me   cried d orbec 



 as for you   rejoined cellini  continuing his royal functions   as for

you  comte d orbec  i spare you the inquiry which i should be justified

in ordering into your conduct  clemency is a kingly virtue  no less than

generosity  is it not  sire  but here are the contracts  all prepared 

let us sign  messieurs  let us sign  



 he plays the king to perfection   cried françois  as happy as a

monarch on a vacation 



he passed the pen to ascanio  who signed with a trembling hand  ascanio

then passed the pen to colombe  to whose assistance madame diane had

gone in pure kindness of heart  the hands of the lovers met  and they

almost swooned 



next came madame diane  who passed the pen to the duchesse d etampes 

who passed it to the provost  the provost to d orbec  and d orbec to the

spanish ambassador 



below all these great names cellini wrote his own in a firm  distinct

hand  and yet he was not the one who had made the least painful

sacrifice 



after writing his name  the spanish ambassador drew nigh the duchess 



 our plans still hold  madame   he asked 



 mon dieu   she replied   do what you choose  what matters france or the

world to me  



the duke bowed  as he resumed his place  his nephew  a young and

inexperienced diplomat  remarked   



 so it is the emperor s purpose that not the king of france  but his

son  shall be duke of milan  



 neither the one nor the other will be   replied the ambassador 



meanwhile other signatures were being affixed 



when every one had written his name as a subscriber to the happiness of

colombe and ascanio  benvenuto walked up to the king  and knelt upon one

knee before him 



 sire   said he   having issued commands as king i now prefer a request

as your majesty s humble and grateful servant  will your majesty deign

to grant me one last favor  



 say on  benvenuto  say on   returned françois  who was in a granting

mood  and who discovered anew that it was the prerogative of royalty

wherein  take it for all in all  a king finds the most pleasure   what

do you desire  



 to return to italy  sire   said benvenuto 



 what does this mean   cried the king   you wish to leave me when you

have so many masterpieces still in hand for me  i ll not have it  



 sire   replied benvenuto   i will return  i give you my word  but let

me go  let me see my country once more  for i feel the need of it just

now  i do not talk of my suffering   he continued  lowering his voice

and shaking his head sadly   but i have many causes of sorrow which i

could not describe  and nothing but the air of my native land can heal

my wounded heart  you are a great and generous king  to whom i am deeply

attached  i will return  sire  but let me go now and be cured in the

bright sunlight of the south  i leave with you ascanio  my brain  and

pagolo  my hand  they will suffice to carry out your artistic dreams

until my return  and when i have received the soft kisses of the breezes

of florence  my mother  i will return to you  my king  and death alone

shall part us  



 go if you will   said françois  sadly   it is fitting that art should

be free as the swallows  go  



he gave benvenuto his hand  which the artist kissed with all the fervor

of heartfelt gratitude 



as they withdrew  benvenuto found himself by the duchess s side 



 are you very angry with me  madame   said he  slipping into her hand

the fatal letter which  like a magic talisman  had accomplished

impossibilities 



 no   said the duchess  overjoyed to have it in her possession at last 

 and yet you defeated me by means   



 go to   said benvenuto   i threatened you with them  but do you think i

would have used them  



 god in heaven   cried the duchess  as if the light had suddenly come to

her   that is what it is to have thought that you were like myself  



the next day  ascanio and colombe were married in the chapel at the

louvre  and  notwithstanding the rules of etiquette  the young people

obtained permission for jacques aubry and his wife to be present 



it was a signal favor  but we must agree that the poor student had well

merited it 









xxiii





mariage de convenance





a week later  hermann solemnly espoused dame perrine  who brought him as

her marriage portion twenty thousand tours livres  and the assurance

that he would soon be a father 



we hasten to say that this assurance had much more to do with the honest

german s determination than the twenty thousand tours livres 



on the evening following the marriage of colombe and ascanio  benvenuto

set out for florence  despite the entreaties of the young husband and

wife 



during his stay in italy  he cast the statue of perseus  which still

adorns the square of the old palace  and which was his most beautiful

work   for no other reason  perhaps  than that he executed it at the

period of his greatest sorrow
