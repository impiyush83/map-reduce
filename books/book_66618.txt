               greg was sure the kids had no right being

            in control of a planet  after all what had they

            learned about life  still  what had he learned

the old ship wheezed and clattered into the landing slot  greg was

an expert pilot  but skill was no substitute for outdated equipment 

he unstrapped the safety webbing and eased himself out of the cabin 

cluttered with its worn and scarred electronic gadgetry  with the

handcrank he opened the airlock  rusting metal screamed as the panel

slid back into the hull  greg found himself panting from the sudden

muscular effort in the heavier atmosphere of the earth 



i m an old man  he thought bitterly  old at forty  as antiquated as

my ship  and as much in need of repair  but no one can do anything

for either of us  i gave them the stars  and in twenty years they ve

forgotten  they ve made me a museum piece  these pampered  undersized

kids of the new generation 



greg walked down the ramp  he hadn t been home for seven years  but he

was still surprised that no flight inspector met him with the officious

clipboard of check out sheets  the landing fields in the colonies were

far more efficiently supervised 



greg saw a light in the field control building and walked toward it 

the field  sprawling for miles across the california desert  was empty 

a mocking moment to the magnificent dream the new generation had

rejected  behind him greg saw the long rows of landing slots  towering

metal shafts raised against the night sky  only four ships rested in

the slots  his and three other rusting cargo carriers  in front of

the unlighted terminal building the passenger liners stood untended 

decaying hulks that would never lift again  fifteen years ago  even

as recently as ten years ago  the california field had hummed with

activity  greg could remember the tide of humanity  the clattering

pick up trucks gliding like curious ants among the freighters  the

shotgun blast of lift tubes  the parade of ships trailing flame across

the sky 



now the dream was gone  the terminal windows were filmed with dust 

grass grew in the cracking asphalt of the field 



greg pushed open the door of the control building  one man sat with

his feet propped on a desk  once the room had required a hundred

technicians  once the traffic control panel  filling a wall nearly a

quarter of a mile long  had been a maze of dancing  colored lights  now

the board was dead  the enamel was peeling  the exposed metal was red

with rust 



the attendant took greg s manifest without interest   you re our first

landing in two years  captain    he glanced at the sheet   captain

greg  i see you re in from mars  



 i m carrying five tons of redearth   in the old days such a cargo

would have cleared three million after transportation costs  a whole

new industry had been built on the martian antibiotical spore 



 no market  i m afraid  captain   the attendant flipped the manifest

aside 



 sell it at auction  i have to raise enough cash to   



 you won t get a buyer  



 i ve got to get some new equipment for my ship  



 you d have done better in the colonies  mars has excellent repair

facilities  we understand  



 at sky high prices  sure  



 the earth isn t building flight equipment any more  what s the point 

the kids don t want it   the attendant shrugged his shoulders   you

aren t the first one  captain greg  who s come home for nothing  and

you won t be the last  check with me tomorrow  i ll see what i can

work out  



 if i can t dispose of my cargo   



 we waive all field charges in cases of destitution  you can dump the

redearth and the kids will stake you to a cargo of iron ore  it s going

at triple premium on venus  we re told  



                                        



greg turned on his heel and walked stiffly out of the building  one

bitter word burned in his mind  destitution  it was like a kick in the

teeth  he thought  in a fury of blind anger  i gave them the stars and

they make me a charity case  this new generation  children who could

never build a colonial bubble or pioneer a star route  soft minded and

soft muscled idiots 



the field attendant hadn t even recognized greg s name 



suddenly the past was alive again  like an angry nightmare  the

speeches and the headlines  the bands and the screaming mobs  the

politicians  the scientists  the generals  handclasps and newsreel

pictures   just one more  sir  for the tv cameras        a citation

by a joint session of the congress of the united states  to captain

victor greg  u  s  rocket forces      greg makes mars     l  a 

welcomes greg     first spaceman in n  y  parade     and i say to

you  my constituents  the name greg shall be forever writ large in the

hearts of a grateful people       greg lands first martian cargo    

 for the discovery of redearth  the eternal gratitude of the medical

profession      greg takes nobel prize      a small token of the

gratitude of american industry      greg joins import firm      the

undying gratitude of the united patriotic mothers of america      first

colonists on mars     colonies on the moons of jupiter     venus bubble

completed    



the dream of yesterday  and the dream was gone  the rocket ports

were dead  the machines were crumbling into rust  and captain victor

greg   a destitute tramp  waiting for a handout from a generation of

brats which had forgotten him 



he crossed the field toward the clutter of buildings beyond the

terminal  port city  raised in less than a year on the california

desert  the first minor miracle of the new frontier  the endless mass

of traffic  the noisy honky tonks  the nervous neon shimmering in

the night  the brassy bands and the fancy women  all of it was gone 

desert sand had drifted across the streets  the highpoled intersection

lights  still burning  cast a blue halo in the empty  dirty windows 



greg s shoulders sagged as he walked toward the central square of

port city  he had to see the monument again  he had to drain the last

bitterness from his homecoming  in the martian colony they had told him

it would be like this  he hadn t believed them  how could a legend be

forgotten in a generation 



from a block away he saw the metal statue  turned a sickly blue by the

corner street light  the high shaft of a primitive rocket ship  with

its nose foregear lifted proudly toward the stars  in the foreground 

the towering giant of a spaceman  his legs spread wide to embrace the

symbolic sphere of the earth   sky frontier   the sculptor had named it

that 



greg sat wearily on the granite base of the monument  he could read 

all too clearly  the lettering on the plaque   commemorating the first

solar flight  earth to mars  made by captain victor greg of the u  s 

rocket fleet  launched from this site on the first day of june and

completed   



greg ground his fists against his eyes  yet still the words

danced through his brain  his attitude of dejection was an ironic

counter point to the confident  metal monster rising above him 

twenty years and a new generation made the difference  yet there was

a striking similarity between the statue and the man  for greg had

posed for the original model  greg was still a powerful  muscular man 

his face was still clean cut and unlined  only the torment in his eyes

reflected the dream he had lost 



 but nothing is lost  it is just  different  



greg looked up  a serious faced boy of twelve stood close to him  in

the shadow of the statue  one of the new children  greg felt a cold

chill crawl up his spine  fear and loathing  he hated them  they had

destroyed his world  they had made him a nonentity  yet when the boy

came closer and greg saw how frail and small he was  the fear seemed

foolish 



 you live around here  kid   greg asked  out in the colonies they said

the new children read minds  which really wasn t much  considering

their other abilities  but greg refused to believe it 



 not minds   the boy corrected him   we know your feelings  which is

probably much the same thing  no  i don t live in port city  i came

from chicago after you landed  i thought you might need me  



from chicago   fifteen hundred miles  the instantaneous transportation

of living matter  greg s mind boggled at the familiar fact  he felt

the hate and the fear again  these were not the natural children of

men  but monstrosities spawned by an unknown universe and eating out

the heart of human culture  greg stood up  his arms stiff and his fists

clenched   when i need the help of a kid   he growled   i ll know it s

time to cash in my chips  



 it s wrong to think that way  captain greg  



 no pint sized child s going to tell me   



 i wanted to make things easier for you  you should have stayed in the

colonies  it was a mistake to come home  



 now you re trying to drive us off the earth  



 we want to save you the discomfort of homecoming  we can t turn back

the clock  neither can you  



                                        



greg strode down the deserted street  through the small drifts of sand 

he recognized the corner where there used to be a bar  he flung open

the door and entered the long  dark room  the stale air smelled of dust

and neglect  his boots echoed hollowly on the oak floor  he fumbled for

a match and in the pale  yellow light he saw the bottles crowding the

shelves 



he snatched a fifth of bourbon and ripped off the cap  he gulped the

liquor thirstily and the hot fire burned warm in his veins  after the

third drink he felt the strong self confidence of his manhood again 

he leaned his elbow against the bar and glanced toward the street  the

sad eyed kid was out there somewhere  waiting like a nightmare  or

maybe he had already done his magic and transported himself back to

chicago 



it didn t matter  the kid wasn t human  greg took another pull at

the bottle and he saw it all very clearly  in the beginning men had

speculated about life forms on other worlds  before greg s pioneering

flight to mars the sunday supplements had been filled with a vast

number of lurid speculations  yet the spacemen had found nothing

but virgin worlds which became the colonies of man  the truth

was  greg understood it now  they had looked for intelligent life in

familiar forms  but there had been something out there  something as

undetectable as a virus epidemic  and as deadly  it had invaded the

earth and captured the minds of the children 



greg killed the bottle  by that time he was very impressed with the

brilliance of his own reasoning  small inconsistencies kept nagging

at his mind and it seemed strange that no one had ever thought of it

before  but all that was of no consequence 



greg heard footsteps outside  his body tensed  was it the kid coming

back  he would know what greg was thinking  he would know how close

greg was to the real truth  and the new children  no  invaders  greg

must remember that  would not let him survive  they were puny and

undersized  physically  greg had no reason to be afraid of them 

but how was he to fight an enemy who could instantly disappear and

rematerialize thousands  or millions  of miles away 



the shuffling steps came closer  a stooped  white haired man  wearing

soiled and unpressed tweeds  stepped through the door  greg seized the

newcomer s shoulder  the man gave a bleat of animal terror 



 who the hell are you   greg demanded 



 dr  vayle  adrian vayle  



 the astrophysicist   greg remembered the name from the ponderous text

he had studied in the flight school 



the old man straightened his shoulders with a semblance of pride   you

know me  



 what are you doing in port city  



 this is where i live  i couldn t stand it in the city any longer and

i didn t want to emigrate to the colonies  the children don t object 

they bring us supplies  holly and i are quite comfortable   dr  vayle

ran his fingers over greg s uniform   you re a pilot  i haven t met one

in years  usually the children send them back to the colonies as soon

as they land  



 where do you live  dr  vayle  



 the best hotel in town  i ll show you   he bent closer and whispered 

 and i ll let you see what we re working on  but i have to have my

nightcap first   vayle groped in the dark for a bottle  he drank the

liquor eagerly  wiping his lips on his sleeve 



greg and the astrophysicist went outside  greg looked along the

deserted street for the twelve year old  but the boy was nowhere in

sight  perhaps he had returned to chicago  yet if he had come to send

greg back to the colonies  would he have given up so easily 



the blue intersection lights swam in a comfortable haze  spinning when

greg looked at them directly  occasionally the drifts of sand seemed to

run like water and greg became unsure of his footing  he knew he was

drunk  but alcohol had never interfered with his reasoning  back in

the bar he had made a tremendous discovery  he mustn t let it slip his

mind  the children were alien invaders  that was it  in the morning he

would be able to decide what he was to do with the information 



the old man took him to a pseudo spanish structure across the main

highway from the field  the  biltmore hacienda   at one time the

gaudiest and costliest hotel in port city  now the neon signs were out 

the streetfront shops were closed  and only a pale light glowed dimly

behind the ornate  iron gate 



                                        



as he followed vayle up the three tile steps  greg looked back toward

the field  he saw his ship standing in its landing slot  someone was

working to unload his useless cargo of redearth  the field attendant

was displaying an unusual conscientiousness  greg thought  he hadn t

expected action in less than a week 



then  abruptly  greg knew the real significance of such prompt service 

it fit with the discovery he had made in the bar  the only trouble was 

his mind was too hazy for him to grasp the connection clearly  it would

come to him later  he was sure of that 



he followed vayle through the dusty  thick carpeted lobby  vayle slept

in a disorderly room adjoining the cavernous hall of the dining room 

where the tables were covered with dust and the band instruments lay

rusting on the bandstand  the astrophysicist swept a litter of loose

manuscript pages from his bed and sat down  he fished a bottle of gin

from under the bed and took a long drink 



 for my nerves   he apologized 



greg saw a score of empty bottles in the debris on the floor 

apparently vayle had been treating his nerves for a long time  greg

picked up one of the manuscript pages  it was a part of a book  at

least the patter of phrases was familiar  but the whole context was

incoherent  without beginning or end 



 my new text   vayle explained   when it s finished  the kids have

promised to publish it  that s why they let me stay here  so i can

work in peace   he pulled at the bottle again   they re still children

at heart  an adult can twist them around his finger  if he goes at it

properly  



 you mean the book s just a blind  



the scientist eyed greg carefully   you re too old  you can t be one of

them   he rolled back the mattress and took out a thin file of paper 

holding it tenderly in his hand   i m analyzing the cause  sir  i m

going to demonstrate how the children have made us believe they are

able to defy the laws of physics  when i publish this  the nightmare

will be over  



vayle handed over the file reluctantly  greg turned back the cover  and

the shock sobered him  vayle was an established authority  vayle was an

eminent scientist  vayle was a man greg had learned to respect  but

the book vayle showed him contained nothing but blank pages 



 you re interested in our project  



the throaty  silky voice came from the open door  greg whirled  he saw

a tall  thin woman  heavily painted  she was wearing a bangled  scarlet

gown  which hung loose from her shoulders  her beauty had faded long

ago  her face was a lined  marble mask  her yellow hair was streaked

with gray  fifteen years ago greg could have found her counterpart

lurking in any port city honky tonk  her thin hips swaying with the

brassy jargon of the music and invitation in her eyes 



 this is holly wilson   vayle said   my secretary  



secretary  greg thought  so that s what they were calling it now  holly

wilson s profession had gone by many names  the pickings on earth must

have become mighty thin  if she were satisfied to saddle herself with

a white haired professor of astrophysics  greg introduced himself 

grinning contemptuously 



 you re just in from the colonies  captain   she asked 



 yes  



 staying long  



 that depends  i have a cargo to auction and   



 the kids will take care of that  but you ll stay through tonight  of

course  let s see if we can find you a room  



greg thought he knew what she had in mind  but as soon as they were

out of earshot of the scientist s bedroom  she said   come outside 

captain  i have to talk to you  



they went into the tiled patio of the hotel  the kidney shaped pool was

empty  and its basin was criss crossed with gaping cracks  many of the

potted shrubs had died untended  but the palms still flourished  the

fronds laced skeletal fingers across the face of the full moon  the

dry  desert wind washed through the trees  the ghost whisper of the

dream that had died in port city 



 don t say anything to dr  vayle about his book   holly wilson s voice

was surprisingly sincere   play along with him  please  let him go on

thinking he s found the great secret  



 what is it  alcoholism or madness  



 a little of both  no one s really sane any more  



 i came home the last time seven years ago  it wasn t this bad then 

what s happened  



 most of the adults have emigrated to the colonies  there are only a

few derelicts left  like adrian vayle and myself  



                                        



nearly sober  greg remembered the discovery he had stumbled on in the

bar  and the logic still held up   they ve taken over the earth and

thrown men out  



 the children  you talk as if   



 tell me everything about it  from the beginning  



 the kids are different  that s all there is to it  they read minds 

they move themselves anywhere they please simply by thinking about it 

god knows what else they ll learn to whip up after they get the hang of

it  



 are all the children like this  



 no  the others emigrated with their parents  dr  vayle says there are

about five million  that s approximately the total population of the

earth  now  they ve shoved the rest of us out  



 by force  



 who wants to hang around like a pet ape to amuse his own brats  dr 

vayle was too old to go  i  i couldn t get a medical clearance  



 i don t think the colonies are aware that the emigration was so large  



 why should they be  we ve half a dozen worlds out there  they could

absorb us all  



 so the kids have taken over everything  



 what they wanted  yes  for a while we thought it was temporary  dr 

vayle didn t begin drinking until we knew the change was permanent 

the oldest kids are nineteen now  they re beginning to marry  and all

their children have the same abilities  or witchcraft  call it what you

like  



 as old as nineteen  then the change dates from   



 from your first flight  captain greg  i sometimes look at that damn

statue in the square and laugh till it hurts  a brave  new frontier you

discovered  but that wasn t all you gave us  



 you believe i m responsible for    greg gestured toward the slow decay

in the patio   for this  



 who else  captain  it s the kids who should build you a monument  you

gave them the earth  



for the first time greg saw the monstrosity hidden by his dream  he

had made the pioneer flight  and he had created this new generation 

the relationship was plain  if he could unravel it and find the real

cause  but he knew that now  an invasion  an invisible virus life that

had taken over their minds  how  when he knew that  how could he fight

it  how could he turn back the clock and restore the earth to man 



he walked slowly to the end of the patio where he could see the

deserted field across the highway  in the slot they were still scooping

the redearth of mars out of the hull of his ship  he smiled grimly  a

decade ago the redearth had been priceless  that one import alone had

made the conquest of space commercially possible  redearth had built

port city and the colonies  redearth had created the import companies 

once so tremendously profitable 



a light burned for a moment above greg s ship  clearly he saw the puny 

twelve year old boy and the four other children who were dumping the

cargo  it gave him another explosive insight  greg knew then how the

invasion had come from the stars 



the redearth of mars  the invisible molds of that unknown world  that

was the alien life form no man had recognized  the enemy was tangible 

the enemy was real  and such an enemy could be conquered 



greg s first inclination was to cross the road and smash with his fist

the pint sized weaklings who had stolen his world  physical conflict 

that was something man understood and respected  but the children were

not human  he must never allow himself to forget that  they had to be

fought on other terms 



first  greg had to escape the earth without letting them read his mind

and measure his hatred  until he could lift his ship  he had to play

along with whatever plans they made for him  the children didn t want

him here  escape should be easy  if he could only wall off his thinking 



he turned back toward the faded woman in the scarlet dress  as

matter of factly as he could  he asked her to show him his room   i ll

probably leave tomorrow  they re doing an efficient job out there  



 the kids don t waste any time  they ll stake you to a cargo of iron

ore for venus  that s the usual procedure   she put her arm through

his   and you promise  captain  you won t say anything to dr  vayle  



 why are you so interested in that old fool  



 we re derelicts  it would be damn lonely without him  he has something

to believe in  nonsense  yes  but what difference does that make 

sometimes i can almost believe in it  too  



 men aren t licked yet  



she laughed   you noble souls who drop in on us out of space talk so

bravely  that s your brand of madness  captain  thank your stars you

don t have to get to know the kids as well as we do  



                                        



she took him to a room on the first floor of the hotel  the air  when

he opened the door  was stale  the full moon behind the venetian blinds

made an unpleasant symbolic shadow pattern of prison bars on the

carpet  greg ripped open the zipper of his flight jacket  his chest was

wet with sweat  the woman turned to go and he caught her arm  pulling

her toward him 



 this much at least hasn t changed   he grinned 



she neither resisted nor responded  she stood looking up into his face 

her eyes were cold and tired   i have to go back to adrian  captain

greg  he s frightened when i leave him alone too long  



 that doddering graybeard   



 none of the things that used to be so important matter any more  all

we have left is our love for each other  adrian and i have that  i

don t want to lose it  



she glided away from him  angrily greg jerked up the blinds  to erase

the prison symbol  and ground open the windows  the hot desert wind

whispered through the screen  greg stripped off his uniform and lay

naked on the bed 



after a time he slept  fitfully  caught in a confusion of fragmentary

dreams  the hope of yesterday and the disillusionment of now  his pride

as a pioneer  and the pain of his responsibility for what his frontier

had created  out of the chaos a pattern of action slowly emerged 

sometime in the small hours before the dawn greg made up his mind what

he would do 



it would be futile to try to arouse the colonies to attack the earth 

each man in his own soul might admit the truth  but as a culture they

would all reject it  they needed to keep the symbol of earth as home 

though they might never return to it  even if that psychological

objection could be overcome  war was not the answer  only if the

children were taken completely by surprise  given no time to use their

alien abilities  could they be effectively destroyed 



greg knew how that could be done  a decade before his pioneer flight

to mars  the first artificial satellite had been sent up in an orbit

around the earth  a purely military weapon  capable of destroying any

objective on the surface of the earth  the satellite had overturned

the balance of power and forced the creation of a united world  the

resources of a planetary government had made greg s first flight

possible  afterward  in the excitement of exploiting the new frontier 

the satellite had been forgotten 



but it was still there  still armed with a firepower capable of wiping

the earth clean of life  it would be the murder of a world  but murder

to save human kind  greg could do it alone  his only problem was to

lift his ship without the children knowing what was in his mind  he

felt no guilt  no pang of conscience  once the decision was made  greg

slept easily  and he awoke completely refreshed  with only a slight

headache from the liquor he had drunk the night before 



dr  vayle and holly wilson insisted that greg breakfast with them in

the hotel  he would have preferred to forage for himself  the painted

woman s protective  maternal affection for the astrophysicist made greg

acutely uncomfortable  it was not the sort of behavior he would have

expected of either of them  greg s discomfort quickly became a feeling

of guilt  if he used the old satellite wheel to destroy the alien

children  he would be slaughtering the few human beings who remained on

the earth  discreetly he asked how many others had stayed behind 



 it s hard to say   vayle told him   a hundred thousand  perhaps  



 do you keep up any sort of contact  



 why should we  we re outcasts   with a sudden rationality  he added 

 we re ashamed  when we re together we feel bound to face the truth 

it s impossible for man to admit he s a second rater  so we hide out in

deserted villages like this one  and pretend all this nightmare never

happened   then vayle slipped back into his delusion again   however 

all that will be different as soon as my research is finished  why  do

you know  captain   



 i m leaving this morning   greg broke in   would you like to go with

me  



vayle shook his head   i m too old to make a new start on your

frontier  captain   he reached for the woman s hand   and as long as my

secretary can t have a clearance   



 leave us as we are   holly said   your dream is no better than ours  



                                        



after breakfast greg left the hotel and crossed the highway to the

field  it was still early morning  but the desert sun blazed hot in a

copper sky  as greg passed the old terminal building  the twelve year

old boy suddenly materialized and fell in step beside him 



this was the thing greg feared most  he began to walk more rapidly 

fighting a rising panic  how could he keep the kid from prying into his

mind  desperately he tried to think of something else  anything  inane

or banal  the children were not gods  they couldn t dig deeper than his

conscious thought   or could they  greg wasn t sure  



 we re giving you a cargo for venus   the boy said conversationally 

 it will put you in business again  captain  the martian colony is

equipped to repair your ship  you ll have enough cash to pay for it 

now  



 fine   greg grunted  in his mind he was frantically reciting a rhyme

his grandmother had taught him ago   one two  buckle my shoe  three

four  open the door      reciting it with fervor  like a prayer for

survival  which it was 



 after this  captain  it might be better if you stayed in the colonies 

don t get me wrong  you re welcome on earth anytime you want to come

home  but conditions are different here and     



suddenly the boy s tone changed   but you aren t responsible  captain  



greg s muscles tensed  so the boy had probed that deep 



 a new frontier always means change  captain  but not tragedy  not

defeat  we ve never supposed any of you would believe that  you gave us

a miracle  the greatest frontier men have ever crossed  when all the

other pioneers are forgotten  captain  your name     



pretty words  like the pretty speeches greg had listened to twenty

years ago  they wanted to confuse him  make him doubt the decision he

had made   one two  buckle my shoe  three four  open the door  



the boy caught greg s sleeve   you might as well blame galileo or

copernicus because they studied the universe  or go back to the

beginning  blame the unknown who did our first scientific pioneering  



copernicus and galileo  what was the kid trying to say  and why would

a twelve year old speak so glibly  so knowingly  of the giants  that

proved his alienness  when greg was twelve  the only thing he had

thought about seriously was football or baseball or summer vacation or

how he was going to get out of the piano lessons his mother imposed on

him 



the boy pulled him to a stop   the first pioneer  captain  do you blame

him for it all  we don t know his name  but we do have his monument 

look  captain greg   in the drifting sand the boy sketched the outline

of a wheel 



greg panicked  he was too intent upon keeping his mind impregnable

to make any other interpretation  the wheel symbolized the satellite

riding above the earth  then the boy knew what greg was going to do 



greg swung his fist blindly  he took the boy by surprise  the child

had no time to rematerialize at a safe distance  greg s fist struck

his chest and the boy went down  with a cry of agony  greg felt a

subconscious surge of satisfaction  humanity hadn t been defeated after

all and the children were by no means invulnerable  surprise  physical

initiative  gave men their trump card over these undernourished mind

readers 



greg sprinted toward his ship  the body lay on the drifting sand

gasping for breath  gesturing futilely with his small hand 



greg s foot was on the ramp when he heard a scream behind him  he

looked back toward the road  he saw dr  vayle and holly wilson running

toward him  a mongrel  frothing at the mouth  was yapping at their

heels 



                                        



greg reacted with an altogether human instinct  he ripped a metal bar

loose from the ramp rail and went back to help them  two fellow humans

in trouble  a tiny warning of logic flamed briefly in his mind  this

could be a trick  his only real chance of escape was to leave now 

while he could  but he ignored it 



he ran across the field and swung the bar at the dog  crushing its

skull with one blow  the woman clutched his arm  her hands were

shaking  her face was white with fear 



 what happened   greg demanded 



 adrian and i were clearing the breakfast table  suddenly the dog

was  he was just there  growling at us  



 a mad dog   the astrophysicist added   the kids did it  they can make

any living thing appear anywhere they please  



 a trick   greg said  the whisper of logic had been right  he glanced

at where the boy had fallen  the child was gone 



 they re trying to make me leave   vayle complained   before i finished

my research  they know i have the answer to   



 now you have no other choice   greg snapped  he pulled the scientist

toward his ship  the woman followed  greg reasoned that he might still

have an outside chance  the children obviously had expected him to take

vayle back to the hotel  that would have given them a chance to disable

his ship 



greg pushed the two through the airlock  his luck still held  he shoved

them toward the safety webbing and jerked down the firing toggle  as

the ship quivered in the thunder of the power tubes  greg dialed the

satellite course on the pilot computer 



it was the simplest setting he could make  his was an old ship  built

when the satellite had still been used as an initial landing station 

before the new fuel had made the big wheel obsolete  every ship had

once had an automatic satellite course projection taped in the pilot

computer  without a new setting  the ship would move into the core ramp

of the wheel and the lock would open automatically when the magnetic

seal was completed 



greg felt the sudden  crushing weight of gravity  he caught at the

safety webbing until the pressure stabilized  from that point  if

he remembered his early flights accurately  it would be six minutes

before the ship reached the satellite  he had won  nothing could stop

him  nothing 



then holly wilson screamed and greg saw the twelve year old boy

standing beside the flight console 



 it wasn t a virus invasion   the child said  shouting to be heard

above the roar of the power tubes   i didn t know you were thinking

that this morning  i could have explained if   



greg swung his fist  against an emptiness  the boy rematerialized two

feet away 



 reset your course   the boy cried   you understand machines  captain 

we don t  and i can t get enough technical information from your mind

to do it for you  



 one two  buckle my shoe   greg thought  in an ecstacy of triumph 

he had kept that much of his thinking safe  the kids were making one

last effort to save themselves  he was sure of that  but it wouldn t

work  they had the alien skill to pry into a human mind  but they were

helpless against man s machines  inexorably the computer would drive

the ship to the satellite  nothing could stop it 



 think rationally   the boy pleaded   not with your emotions  you have

only four minutes left  captain greg  if the redearth was a virus

invasion as you believe it was  why were only the children affected 

we made it an antibiotic  we used it for millions of people  every

colonist was innoculated before he emigrated  



he was lying  he had to be lying  he was trying to confuse greg with

side issues  it didn t matter now how the virus had been brought back

to the earth   three four  open the door  five six  pick up sticks  



 we aren t different  captain  we ve simply crossed your frontier in

a different way  we have a theory how it happened  but no proof  the

martian redearth worked as a sort of mental catalyst when it was used

for newly born infants  it awoke the full thought potential of our

cerebral cortex  that s all  we have no ability that men haven t always

been capable of  if you believe that  you can do it yourself  



belief   mystical nonsense  did the kid really think greg would buy

that  greg glanced at adrian vayle  the scientist s face was gray

with horror  sweat stood in beads on his lips  holly wilson clung

desperately to his hand 



 i drew a wheel in the sand for you  captain  another monument to

another pioneer  the first primitive who grasped what we might do with

a rolling disk  he gave us terror and disaster  yes  but he gave us

progress  too  do we blame him because his heirs sometimes misapplied

his discovery  do we call ourselves alien invaders because we have

a more complex technology than his  then why heap shame on yourself

because you gave us a frontier in the stars  it won t end the way you

thought it would  nothing ever does  we re your children  captain 

we re your new frontier  



 aliens   greg spat 



 my research was for nothing   dr  vayle said numbly  the words were a

whisper of agony  the torment of a soul ripped out of the comfortable

world of madness 



 don t say that  you ll finish your work   holly told him soothingly 



he pushed her away   not now  it was pointless  



the boy wrung his hands   you have only two minutes left  forget your

emotions  put aside your self pity  it s a luxury you can t afford any

longer  use the brains god gave you  captain greg  you can t land on

the satellite  you must   



                                        



greg swung again and again he missed the boy  but he lost his balance

and plunged into the pilot computer  smashing the machine  greg saw

what he had done and began to laugh  it was impossible  now  for anyone

to change the course setting  the boy s pleading was for nothing 



the twelve year old rematerialized and stood looking at the broken

computer  then shrugged his shoulders calmly   a minute and a half

left  captain  and now you have no choice   the child sighed  as a

parent might have sighed over the prank of a mischievious son 



 you killed the mad dog   he said   you didn t hesitate about that  i

thought him into port city to give you an object lesson  you missed

the point  i m afraid  you couldn t understand that you were yourself

a mad dog yapping at our heels  potentially  all the older generation

threaten us the same way  your kind of emotional reasoning  in one

form or another  will sooner or later infect them all  we encouraged

the migration to the colonies in order to prevent a conflict  by

administering the redearth to every adult who left the earth  we

thought we might make a few of them realize their mental capacity 

apparently the catalyst works only with an infant  and not always then 

in a sense  captain greg  your frontier has made us two species  ours 

mankind  yours  the rejects  the unfinished men  



dr  vayle made a choking sound deep in his throat  his dream was gone 

the comfort of his madness had been stripped away from him 



 and if it does come to the point of conflict   the boy went on

quietly   we fully intend to survive  



 not after i reach the satellite   greg answered grimly  his voice

sounded hollow and uncertain  even to himself  the boy had destroyed

the dramatic fiction of a virus invasion  greg s dream  too  was gone 



 i tried to save you  captain  but by your own violence you made that

impossible  now you will provide another object lesson  what i have

told you is true  every man has our ability  in sixty seconds your ship

will reach the old satellite  the airlock will open automatically  only

there will be no air in the wheel  this shell rusted open years ago 

you face death just as certain as if you leaped into outer space  but

you can save yourselves  all three of you  by thinking yourselves back

to the earth  or out to one of the colonies  this experiment interests

us a great deal  we didn t intend to resort to it quite so soon  but

you ve given us an ideal opportunity  if you can unshackle your minds

now  we have hope for the rest of the rejects  there will be fewer mad

dogs for us to dispose of later on  



the boy was gone 



greg felt the ship slide into the ramp of the satellite  he heard the

grapples clang against the hull  and the scream of rusting metal as the

airlock began to open  a paralyzing emotional opiate flamed through his

mind  this was a dream  nothing more  in a moment he would jerk himself

awake and be amused by his terror  but there was something else in his

mind  too  a stirring of greatness  a fire of magnificence  a new self

he had never known before  he groped blindly toward that pinpoint of

light 



from a great distance  like an echo of shattering ice  he heard

adrian vayle s voice   the children have mastered the art of hypnotic

illusion  but obviously they cannot violate the established physical

laws  our problem is entirely mechanical  i am sure captain greg can

work out     



vayle had found the sublime ignorance of sanity  and that was no

solution 



 kiss me   holly wilson whispered   nothing else matters  adrian  



and she had chosen the equally blind sterility of resignation 



greg knew they were both wrong  he was a realist  a spaceman had to be 

the kid had been able to read his thoughts  naturally the kid could put

this weird sense of a new self in greg s mind  it was only a clever 

semantic manipulation of words to keep greg from using the satellite 



he squared his shoulders  the star point of greatness flickered out in

his mind  greg was a man  a product of a sophisticated and intelligent

culture  this undernourished  alien generation wasn t going to confuse

him with mystic mumbo jumbo about belief  he knew how to sort out fact

from childish magic 



he walked toward the lock  straight and proud with the confidence of

man  he was smiling savagely  mankind was no mad dog  to be crushed

into oblivion by a pack of puny children  they might as well learn that

now 



and then the airlock screamed open

freely shared with anyone  for forty years  he produced and

distributed project gutenberg tm ebooks with only a loose network of

volunteer support
